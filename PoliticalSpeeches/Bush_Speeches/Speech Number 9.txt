Freedom itself was attacked this morning by a faceless coward. And freedom will be defended.
I want to reassure the American people that full -- the full resources of the federalgovernment are working to assist local authorities to save lives and to help the victims ofthese attacks.
Make no mistake, the United States will hunt down and punish those responsible for thesecowardly acts.
I've been in regular contact with the Vice President, Secretary of Defense, the nationalsecurity team, and my cabinet. We have taken all appropriate -- appropriate securityprecautions to protect the American people. 
Our military at home and around the world is on high alert status. And we have taken thenecessary security precautions to continue the functions of your government. 
We have been in touch with leaders of Congress and with world leaders to assure them thatwe will do what is -- whatever is necessary to protect America and Americans.

I ask the American people to join me in saying a "thanks" for all the folks who have beenfighting hard to rescue our fellow citizens, and to join me in saying a prayer for the victimsand their families. 
The resolve of our great nation is being tested, but make no mistake. We will show the worldthat we will pass this test. 
God bless.
