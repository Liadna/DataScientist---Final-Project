Thank you, all. 
Chief Justice Rehnquist, President Carter, President Bush, President Clinton, distinguishedguests and my fellow citizens:
The peaceful transfer of authority is rare in history, yet common in our country. With a simpleoath, we affirm old traditions and make new beginnings.
As I begin, I thank President Clinton for his service to our nation.
And I thank Vice President Gore for a contest conducted with spirit and ended with grace.
I am honored and humbled to stand here, where so many of America's leaders have comebefore me, and so many will follow.
We have a place, all of us, in a long story -- a story we continue, but whose end we will notsee. It is a story of a new world that became a friend and liberator of the old, a story of aslave-holding society that became a servant of freedom, the story of a power that went intothe world to protect but not possess, to defend but not to conquer.

It is the American story -- a story of flawed and fallible people, united across the generationsby grand and enduring ideals. The grandest of these ideals is an unfolding American promisethat everyone belongs, that everyone deserves a chance, that no insignificant person wasever born. Americans are called to enact this promise in our lives and in our laws. And thoughour nation has sometimes halted, and sometimes delayed, we must follow no other course.
Through much of the last century, America's faith in freedom and democracy was a rock in araging sea. Now it is a seed upon the wind, taking root in many nations. Our democratic faithis more than the creed of our country, it is the inborn hope of our humanity, an ideal we carrybut do not own, a trust we bear and pass along. And even after nearly 225 years, we have along way yet to travel.
While many of our citizens prosper, others doubt the promise, even the justice, of our owncountry. The ambitions of some Americans are limited by failing schools and hidden prejudiceand the circumstances of their birth. And sometimes our differences run so deep, it seems weshare a continent, but not a country. We do not accept this, and we will not allow it. Ourunity, our union, is the serious work of leaders and citizens in every generation.
And this is my solemn pledge: I will work to build a single nation of justice and opportunity.
I know this is in our reach because we are guided by a Power larger than ourselves whocreates us equal in His image.
And we are confident in principles that unite and lead us onward. America has never beenunited by blood or birth or soil. We are bound by ideals that move us beyond ourbackgrounds, lift us above our interests and teach us what it means to be citizens. Every childmust be taught these principles. Every citizen must uphold them. And every immigrant, byembracing these ideals, makes our country more, not less, American.
Today -- Today we affirm a new commitment to live out our nation's promise through civility,courage, compassion, and character. America, at its best, matches a commitment to principlewith a concern for civility. A civil society demands from each of us good will and respect, fairdealing and forgiveness.
Some seem to believe that our politics can afford to be petty because, in a time of peace, thestakes of our debates appear small. But the stakes for America are never small. If our countrydoes not lead the cause of freedom, it will not be led. If we do not turn the hearts of childrentoward knowledge and character, we will lose their gifts and undermine their idealism. If wepermit our economy to drift and decline, the vulnerable will suffer most.
We must live up to the calling we share. Civility is not a tactic or a sentiment. It is thedetermined choice of trust over cynicism, of community over chaos. And this commitment, ifwe keep it, is a way to shared accomplishment.

America, at its best, is also courageous. Our national courage has been clear in times ofdepression and war, when defeating common dangers defined our common good. Now wemust choose if the example of our fathers and mothers will inspire us or condemn us. Wemust show courage in a time of blessing by confronting problems instead of passing them onto future generations.
Together, we will reclaim America's schools, before ignorance and apathy claim more younglives. We will reform Social Security and Medicare, sparing our children from struggles wehave the power to prevent. And we'll reduce taxes, to recover the momentum of our economyand reward the effort and enterprise of working Americans. We will build our defenses beyondchallenge, lest weakness invite challenge. We will confront weapons of mass destruction, sothat a new century is spared new horrors.
The enemies of liberty and our country should make no mistake: America remains engaged inthe world by history and by choice, shaping a balance of power that favors freedom. We willdefend our allies and our interests. We will show purpose without arrogance. We will meetaggression and bad faith with resolve and strength. And to all nations, we will speak for thevalues that gave our nation birth.
America, at its best, is compassionate. In the quiet of American conscience, we know thatdeep, persistent poverty is unworthy of our nation's promise. And whatever our views of itscause, we can agree that children at risk are not at fault. Abandonment and abuse are notacts of God, they are failures of love. And the proliferation of prisons, however necessary, isno substitute for hope and order in our souls. Where there is suffering, there is duty.Americans in need are not strangers, they are citizens, not problems, but priorities. And all ofus are diminished when any are hopeless.
Government has great responsibilities for public safety and public health, for civil rights andcommon schools. Yet compassion is the work of a nation, not just a government. And someneeds and hurts are so deep they will only respond to a mentor's touch or a pastor's prayer.Church and charity, synagogue and mosque lend our communities their humanity, and theywill have an honored place in our plans and in our laws.
Many in our country do not know the pain of poverty, but we can listen to those who do. And Ican pledge our nation to a goal: When we see that wounded traveler on the road to Jericho,we will not pass to the other side.
America, at its best, is a place where personal responsibility is valued and expected.Encouraging responsibility is not a search for scapegoats, it is a call to conscience. And thoughit requires sacrifice, it brings a deeper fulfillment. We find the fullness of life not only inoptions, but in commitments. And we find that children and community are the commitmentsthat set us free.

Our public interest depends on private character, on civic duty and family bonds and basicfairness, on -- on uncounted, unhonored acts of decency which give direction to our freedom.Sometimes in life we're called to do great things. But as a saint of our times has said, everyday we are called to "do small things with great love."¹ The most important tasks of ademocracy are done by everyone.
I will live and lead by these principles: to advance my convictions with civility, to pursue thepublic interest with courage, to speak for greater justice and compassion, to call forresponsibility and try to live it as well. In all these ways, I will bring the values of our historyto the care of our times.
What you do is as important as anything government does. I ask you to seek a common goodbeyond your comfort; to defend needed reforms against easy attacks; to serve your nation,beginning with your neighbor. I ask you to be citizens: citizens, not spectators; citizens, notsubjects; responsible citizens, building communities of service and a nation of character.
Americans are generous and strong and decent, not because we believe in ourselves, butbecause we hold beliefs beyond ourselves. When this spirit of citizenship is missing, nogovernment program can replace it. When this spirit is present, no wrong can stand against it.
Much time has passed since Jefferson arrived for his inauguration. The years and changesaccumulate. But the themes of this day he would know: our nation's grand story of courageand its simple dream of dignity.
We are not this story's Author, who fills time and eternity with His purpose. Yet His purpose isachieved in our duty, and our duty is fulfilled in service to one another.
Never tiring, never yielding, never finishing, we renew that purpose today, to make ourcountry more just and generous, to affirm the dignity of our lives and every life.
This work continues. The story goes on. And an angel still rides in the whirlwind and directsthis storm.
God bless you all, and God bless America.
