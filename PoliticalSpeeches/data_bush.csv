"Thank you very much. Good evening, my fellow Americans. I appreciate so very much the opportunity to speak withyou tonight.Mr. Speaker, Lieutenant Governor, friends, distinguished guests, our country has beenthrough a long and trying period, with the outcome of the presidential election not finalized forlonger than any of us could ever imagine.Vice President Gore and I put our hearts and hopes into our campaigns. We both gave it ourall. We shared similar emotions, so I understand how difficult this moment must be for VicePresident Gore and his family.He has a distinguished record of service to our country as a congressman, a senator and avice president.This evening I received a gracious call from the vice president. We agreed to meet early nextweek in Washington, and we agreed to do our best to heal our country after this hard-foughtcontest. Tonight I want to thank all the thousands of volunteers and campaign workers who worked sohard on my behalf.I also salute the vice president and his supports for waging a spirited campaign. And I thankhim for a call that I know was difficult to make. Laura and I wish the vice president andSenator Lieberman and their families the very best.I have a lot to be thankful for tonight. I'm thankful for America and thankful that we were ableto resolve our electoral differences in a peaceful way.I'm thankful to the American people for the great privilege of being able to serve as your nextpresident.I want to thank my wife and our daughters for their love. Laura's active involvement as firstlady has made Texas a better place, and she will be a wonderful first lady of America.I am proud to have Dick Cheney by my side, and America will be proud to have him as ournext vice president.Tonight, I chose to speak from the chamber of the Texas House of Representatives because ithas been a home to bipartisan cooperation. Here in a place where Democrats have themajority, Republicans and Democrats have worked together to do what is right for the peoplewe represent.We've had spirited disagreements. And in the end, we found constructive consensus. It is anexperience I will always carry with me, an example I will always follow.I want to thank my friend, House Speaker Pete Laney, a Democrat, who introduced me today.I want to thank the legislators from both political parties with whom I've worked. Across the hall in our Texas capitol is the state Senate. And I cannot help but think of ourmutual friend, the former Democrat lieutenant governor, Bob Bullock. His love for Texas andhis ability to work in a bipartisan way continue to be a model for all of us.The spirit of cooperation I have seen in this hall is what is needed in Washington, D.C. It isthe challenge of our moment. After a difficult election, we must put politics behind us andwork together to make the promise of America available for every one of our citizens.I'm optimistic that we can change the tone in Washington, D.C.I believe things happen for a reason, and I hope the long wait of the last five weeks willheighten a desire to move beyond the bitterness and partisanship of the recent past.Our nation must rise above a house divided. Americans share hopes and goals and values farmore important than any political disagreements. Republicans want the best for our nation, and so do Democrats. Our votes may differ, but notour hopes.I know America wants reconciliation and unity. I know Americans want progress. And we mustseize this moment and deliver.Together, guided by a spirit of common sense, common courtesy and common goals, we canunite and inspire the American citizens.Together, we will work to make all our public schools excellent, teaching every student ofevery background and every accent, so that no child is left behind.Together, we will save Social Security and renew its promise of a secure retirement forgenerations to come.Together, we will strengthen Medicare and offer prescription drug coverage to all of ourseniors.Together, we will give Americans the broad, fair, and fiscally responsible tax relief theydeserve.Together, we'll have a bipartisan foreign policy true to our values and true to our friends, andwe will have a military equal to every challenge and superior to every adversary.Together, we will address some of society's deepest problems one person at a time, byencouraging and empowering the good hearts and good works of the American people.This is the essence of compassionate conservatism and it will be a foundation of myadministration.These priorities are not merely Republican concerns or Democratic concerns; they areAmerican responsibilities.During the fall campaign, we differed about the details of these proposals, but there wasremarkable consensus about the important issues before us: excellent schools, retirement andhealth security, tax relief, a strong military, a more civil society.We have discussed our differences. Now it is time to find common ground and build consensusto make America a beacon of opportunity in the 21st century.I'm optimistic this can happen. Our future demands it and our history proves it. Two hundredyears ago, in the election of 1800, America faced another close presidential election. A tie inthe Electoral College put the outcome into the hands of Congress. After six days of voting and 36 ballots, the House of Representatives elected Thomas Jeffersonthe third president of the United States. That election brought the first transfer of power fromone party to another in our new democracy.Shortly after the election, Jefferson, in a letter titled ""Reconciliation and Reform,"" wrote this:""The steady character of our countrymen is a rock to which we may safely moor; unequivocalin principle, reasonable in manner. We should be able to hope to do a great deal of good tothe cause of freedom and harmony.""Two hundred years have only strengthened the steady character of America. And so as webegin the work of healing our nation, tonight I call upon that character: respect for eachother, respect for our differences, generosity of spirit, and a willingness to work hard andwork together to solve any problem.I have something else to ask you, to ask every American. I ask for you to pray for this greatnation. I ask for your prayers for leaders from both parties. I thank you for your prayers forme and my family, and I ask you to pray for Vice President Gore and his family.I have faith that with God's help we as a nation will move forward together as one nation,indivisible. And together we will create an America that is open, so every citizen has access tothe American dream; an America that is educated, so every child has the keys to realize thatdream; and an America that is united in our diversity and our shared American values that arelarger than race or party.I was not elected to serve one party, but to serve one nation.The president of the United States is the president of every single American, of every race andevery background.Whether you voted for me or not, I will do my best to serve your interests and I will work toearn your respect.I will be guided by President Jefferson's sense of purpose, to stand for principle, to bereasonable in manner, and above all, to do great good for the cause of freedom and harmony.The presidency is more than an honor. It is more than an office. It is a charge to keep, and Iwill give it my all.Thank you very much and God bless America.",bush
"Good  evening.   Today,  our  fellow  citizens,  our  way  of  life,  our  very  freedom  came  under  attack  in  a  series  of   deliberate  and  deadly  terrorist  acts.  The  victims  were  in  airplanes  or  in  their  offices:   secretaries,  business  men  and  women,  military  and  federal  workers,  moms  and  dads,  friends   and  neighbors.  Thousands  of  lives  were  suddenly  ended  by  evil,  despicable  acts  of  terror.  The   pictures  of  airplanes  flying  into  buildings,  fires  burning,  huge        huge  structures  collapsing   have  filled  us  with  disbelief,  terrible  sadness,  and  a  quiet,  unyielding  anger.  These  acts  of   mass  murder  were  intended  to  frighten  our  nation  into  chaos  and  retreat.  But  they  have   failed.  Our  country  is  strong.   A  great  people  has  been  moved  to  defend  a  great  nation.  Terrorist  attacks  can  shake  the   foundations  of  our  biggest  buildings,  but  they  cannot  touch  the  foundation  of  America.  These   acts  shatter  steel,  but  they  cannot  dent  the  steel  of  American  resolve.  America  was  targeted   for  attack  because  we're  the  brightest  beacon  for  freedom  and  opportunity  in  the  world.  And   no  one  will  keep  that  light  from  shining.  Today,  our  nation  saw  evil        the  very  worst  of  human   nature        and  we  responded  with  the  best  of  America.  With  the  daring  of  our  rescue  workers,   with  the  caring  for  strangers  and  neighbors  who  came  to  give  blood  and  help  in  any  way  they   could.   Immediately  following  the  first  attack,  I  implemented  our  government's  emergency  response   plans.  Our  military  is  powerful,  and  it's  prepared.  Our  emergency  teams  are  working  in  New   York  City  and  Washington  D.C.  to  help  with  local  rescue  efforts.  Our  first  priority  is  to  get  help   to  those  who  have  been  injured,  and  to  take  every  precaution  to  protect  our  citizens  at  home   and  around  the  world  from  further  attacks.  The  functions  of  our  government  continue  without   interruption.  Federal  agencies  in  Washington  which  had  to  be  evacuated  today  are  reopening   for  essential  personnel  tonight  and  will  be  open  for  business  tomorrow.  Our  financial   institutions  remain  strong,  and  the  American  economy  will  be  open  for  business  as  well.    The  search  is  underway  for  those  who  were  behind  these  evil  acts.  I  have  directed  the  full   resources  of  our  intelligence  and  law  enforcement  communities  to  find  those  responsible  and   to  bring  them  to  justice.  We  will  make  no  distinction  between  the  terrorists  who  committed   these  acts  and  those  who  harbor  them.   I  appreciate  so  very  much  the  members  of  Congress  who  have  joined  me  in  strongly   condemning  these  attacks.  And  on  behalf  of  the  American  people,  I  thank  the  many  world   leaders  who  have  called  to  offer  their  condolences  and  assistance.  America  and  our  friends   and  allies  join  with  all  those  who  want  peace  and  security  in  the  world,  and  we  stand  together   to  win  the  war  against  terrorism.   Tonight,  I  ask  for  your  prayers  for  all  those  who  grieve,  for  the  children  whose  worlds  have   been  shattered,  for  all  whose  sense  of  safety  and  security  has  been  threatened.  And  I  pray   they  will  be  comforted  by  a  Power  greater  than  any  of  us,  spoken  through  the  ages  in  Psalm   23:   Even  though  I  walk  through  the  valley  of  the  shadow  of  death,  I  fear  no  evil  for  you  are  with   me.   This  is  a  day  when  all  Americans  from  every  walk  of  life  unite  in  our  resolve  for  justice  and   peace.  America  has  stood  down  enemies  before,  and  we  will  do  so  this  time.  None  of  us  will   ever  forget  this  day,  yet  we  go  forward  to  defend  freedom  and  all  that  is  good  and  just  in  our   world.   Thank  you.  Good  night.  And  God  bless  America.",bush
"President Bush: Thank you all. I want you all to know -- it [bullhorn] can't go any louder -- I want you all to know that American today, American today is on bended knee, in prayer for the people whose lives were lost here, for the workers who work here, for the families who mourn. The nation stands with the good people of New York City and New Jersey and Connecticut as we mourn the loss of thousands of our citizens Rescue Worker: I can't hear you! President Bush: I can hear you! I can hear you! The rest of the world hears you! And the people -- and the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon! Rescue Workers: [Chanting] U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! President Bush: The nation -- The nation sends its love and compassion -- Rescue Worker: God bless America! President Bush: -- to everybody who is here. Thank you for your hard work. Thank you for makin' the nation proud, and may God bless America. Rescue Workers: [Chanting] U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!",bush
"We are here in the middle hour of our grief. So many have suffered so great a loss, and today we express our nation's sorrow. We come before God to pray for the missing and the dead, and for those who loved them. On Tuesday, our country was attacked with deliberate andmassive cruelty. We have seen the images of fire and ashes and bent steel. Now come the names, the list of casualties we are only beginning to read: They are the names of men and women who began their day at a desk or in an airport,busy with life. They are the names of people who faced death and in their last moments called hometo say, be brave and I love you. They are the names of passengers who defied their murderers and prevented themurder of others on the ground. They are the names of men and women who wore the uniform of the United States anddied at their posts. They are the names of rescuers -- the ones whom death found running up the stairsand into the fires to help others. We will read all these names. We will linger over them and learn their stories, and manyAmericans will weep. To the children and parents and spouses and families and friends of the lost, we offer the deepest sympathy of the nation. And I assure you, you are not alone. Just three days removed from these events, Americans do not yet have the distance of history, but ourresponsibility to history is already clear: to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil. War has been waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder. This nation is peaceful, but fierce when stirred to anger. This conflict was begun on the timing and terms of others; it will end in a way and at an hour of our choosing. Our purpose as a nation is firm, yet our wounds as a people are recent and unhealed and lead us to pray. In many of our prayers this week, there's a searching and an honesty. At St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York, on Tuesday, awoman said, ""I pray to God to give us a sign that He's still here."" Others have prayed for the same, searching hospital to hospital, carrying pictures of those still missing. God's signs are not always the ones we look for. We learn in tragedy that His purposes are not always our own, yet the prayers of private suffering, whether in our homes or in this great cathedral are known and heard and understood. There are prayers that help us last through the day or endure the night. There are prayers of friends and strangers that give us strength for the journey, and there are prayers that yield our will to a Will greater than ourown. This world He created is of moral design. Grief and tragedy and hatred are only for a time. Goodness, remembrance and love have no end, and the Lord of life holds all who die and allwho mourn. It is said that adversity introduces us to ourselves. This is true of a nation as well. In this trial, we have been reminded and the world has seen that our fellow Americans are generous andkind, resourceful and brave. We see our national character in rescuers working past exhaustion, in long lines of blooddonors, in thousands of citizens who have asked to work and serve in any way possible. And we have seen our national character in eloquent acts of sacrifice: Inside the World Trade Center, one man who could have saved himself stayed until theend and at the side of his quadriplegic friend. A beloved priest died giving the last rites to a firefighter. Two office workers, finding a disabled stranger, carried her down 68 floors to safety. A group of men drove through the night from Dallas to Washington to bring skin graftsfor burned victims. In these acts and many others, Americans showed a deep commitment to one another and anabiding love for our country. Today, we feel what Franklin Roosevelt called, ""the warm courage of national unity."" This is a unity of every faith and every background. It has joined together political parties and both houses of Congress. It is evident in services of prayer and candlelight vigils and American flags, which are displayed in pride and waved in defiance. Our unity is a kinship of grief and a steadfast resolve to prevail against our enemies. And this unity against terror is nowextending across the world. America is a nation full of good fortune, with so much to be grateful for, but we are not spared from suffering. In every generation, the world has produced enemies of human freedom. They have attacked America because we are freedom's home and defender, and the commitment ofour Fathers is now the calling of our time. On this national day of prayer and remembrance, we ask Almighty God to watch over our nation and grant us patience and resolve in all that is to come. We pray that He will comfort and console those who now walk in sorrow. We thank Him for each life we now must mourn,and the promise of a life to come. As we've been assured, neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities, nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth can separate us from God's love. May He bless the souls of the departed. May He comfort our own. And may He always guide our country. God bless America.",bush
"Good morning. This weekend I am engaged in extensive sessions with members of my National Security Council, as we plan a comprehensive assault on terrorism. This will be adifferent kind of conflict against a different kind of enemy. This is a conflict without battlefields or beachheads, a conflict with opponents who believe they are invisible. Yet, they are mistaken. They will be exposed, and they will discover what others in the past have learned: Those who make war against the United States have chosen their own destruction. Victory against terrorism will not take place in a single battle, but in a series of decisive actions against terrorist organizations and those who harbor and supportthem. We are planning a broad and sustained campaign to secure our country and eradicate the evil of terrorism. And we are determined to see this conflict through. Americans of every faith andbackground are committed to this goal. Yesterday I visited the site of the destruction in New York City and saw an amazing spirit of sacrifice and patriotism and defiance. I met with rescuers who have worked past exhaustion,who cheered for our country and the great cause we have entered. In Washington, D.C., the political parties and both Houses of Congress have shown a remarkable unity, and I'm deeply grateful. A terrorist attack designed to tear us apart has instead bound us together as a nation. Over the past few days, we have learned much about American courage -- the courage of firefighters and police officers who suffered so great a loss, the courage of passengers aboard United 93 who may well have fought with thehijackers and saved many lives on the ground. Now we honor those who died, and prepare to respond to these attacks on our nation. I will not settle for a token act. Our response must be sweeping, sustained, and effective. We havemuch do to, and much to ask of the American people. You will be asked for your patience -- for the conflict will not be short. You will be asked for resolve -- for the conflict will not be easy. You will be asked for your strength, because thecourse to victory may be long. In the past week, we have seen the American people at their very best everywhere in America. Citizens have come together to pray, to give blood, to fly our country'sflag. Americans are coming together to share their grief and gain strength from one another. Great tragedy has come to us, and we are meeting it with the best that is in our country, with courage and concern for others: because this is America. This is who we are. This is what ourenemies hate and have attacked. And this is why we will prevail. Thank you for listening.",bush
"Thank  you  all  very  much  for  your  hospitality.  We've  just  had  wide  ranging  discussions  on  the   matter  at  hand.  Like  the  good  folks  standing  with  me,  the  American  people  were  appalled  and   outraged  at  last  Tuesday's  attacks.  And  so  were  Muslims  all  across  the  world.  Both  Americans   and  Muslim  friends  and  citizens,  tax  paying  citizens,  and  Muslims  in  nations  were  just  appalled   and  could  not  believe  what  we  saw  on  our  TV  screens.   These  acts  of  violence  against  innocents  violate  the  fundamental  tenets  of  the  Islamic  faith.   And  it's  important  for  my  fellow  Americans  to  understand  that.  The  English  translation  is  not   as  eloquent  as  the  original  Arabic,  but  let  me  quote  from  the  Koran,  itself:  In  the  long  run,  evil   in  the  extreme  will  be  the  end  of  those  who  do  evil.  For  that  they  rejected  the  signs  of  Allah   and  held  them  up  to  ridicule.  1   The  face  of  terror  is  not  the  true  faith  of  Islam.  That's  not  what  Islam  is  all  about.  Islam  is   peace.  These  terrorists  don't  represent  peace.  They  represent  evil  and  war.  When  we  think  of   Islam  we  think  of  a  faith  that  brings  comfort  to  a  billion  people  around  the  world.  Billions  of   people  find  comfort  and  solace  and  peace.  And  that's  made  brothers  and  sisters  out  of  every   race,  out  of  every  race.  America  counts  millions  of  Muslims  amongst  our  citizens,  and  Muslims   make  an  incredibly  valuable  contribution  to  our  country.  Muslims  are  doctors,  lawyers,  law   professors,  members  of  the  military,  entrepreneurs,  shopkeepers,  moms  and  dads.  And  they   need  to  be  treated  with  respect.  In  our  anger  and  emotion,  our  fellow  Americans  must  treat   each  other  with  respect.    Women  who  cover  their  heads  in  this  country  must  feel  comfortable  going  outside  their   homes.  Moms  who  wear  cover  must  be  not  intimidated  in  America.  That's  not  the  America  I   know.  That's  not  the  America  I  value.  I've  been  told  that  some  fear  to  leave    some  don't  want   to  go  shopping  for  their  families    some  don't  want  to  go  about  their  ordinary  daily  routines   because,  by  wearing  cover,  they're  afraid  they'll  be  intimidated.  That  should  not  and  that  will   not  stand  in  America.  Those  who  feel  like  they  can  intimidate  our  fellow  citizens  to  take  out   their  anger  don't  represent  the  best  of  America,  they  represent  the  worst  of  humankind,  and   they  should  be  ashamed  of  that  kind  of  behavior.   Now  this  is  a  great  country.  It's  a  great  country  because  we  share  the  same  values  of  respect   and  dignity  and  human  worth.  And  it  is  my  honor  to  be  meeting  with  leaders  who  feel  just  the   same  way  I  do.  They're  outraged.  They're  sad.  They  love  America  just  as  much  as  I  do.   And  I  want  to  thank  you  all  for  giving  me  a  chance  to  come  by.   And  may  God  bless  us  all.   Thank  you.   1  Holy  Qur'an  [30:10]:  ""Have  they  not  travelled  in  the  earth  so  that  they  might  see  how  evil  was  the  end  of  those  who  were  before  them?  They   were  stronger  than  these  in  power,  and  they  tilled  the  soil  and  populated  it  more  and  better  than  these  have  populated  it.  And  their  Messengers   came  to  them  with  manifest  Signs.  And  Allah  would  not  wrong  them,  but  they  wronged  their  own  souls.""

"Mr.  Speaker,  Mr.  President  Pro  Tempore,  members  of  Congress,  and  fellow  Americans:   In  the  normal  course  of  events,  Presidents  come  to  this  chamber  to  report  on  the  state  of  the   Union.  Tonight,  no  such  report  is  needed.  It  has  already  been  delivered  by  the  American   people.   We  have  seen  it  in  the  courage  of  passengers,  who  rushed  terrorists  to  save  others  on  the   ground        passengers  like  an  exceptional  man  named  Todd  Beamer.  And  would  you  please   help  me  to  welcome  his  wife,  Lisa  Beamer,  here  tonight.  We  have  seen  the  state  of  our  Union   in  the  endurance  of  rescuers,  working  past  exhaustion.  We've  seen  the  unfurling  of  flags,  the   lighting  of  candles,  the  giving  of  blood,  the  saying  of  prayers        in  English,  Hebrew,  and   Arabic.  We  have  seen  the  decency  of  a  loving  and  giving  people  who  have  made  the  grief  of   strangers  their  own.  My  fellow  citizens,  for  the  last  nine  days,  the  entire  world  has  seen  for   itself  the  state  of  our  Union        and  it  is  strong.   Tonight  we  are  a  country  awakened  to  danger  and  called  to  defend  freedom.  Our  grief  has   turned  to  anger,  and  anger  to  resolution.  Whether  we  bring  our  enemies  to  justice,  or  bring   justice  to  our  enemies,  justice  will  be  done.  I  thank  the  Congress  for  its  leadership  at  such  an   important  time.  All  of  America  was  touched  on  the  evening  of  the  tragedy  to  see  Republicans   and  Democrats  joined  together  on  the  steps  of  this  Capitol,  singing  ""God  Bless  America.""  And   you  did  more  than  sing    you  acted,  by  delivering  40  billion  dollars  to  rebuild  our  communities   and  meet  the  needs  of  our  military.  Speaker  Hastert,  Minority  Leader  Gephardt,  Majority   Leader  Daschle,  and  Senator  Lott,  I  thank  you  for  your  friendship,  for  your  leadership,  and  for   your  service  to  our  country.  And  on  behalf  of  the  American  people,  I  thank  the  world  for  its   outpouring  of  support.  America  will  never  forget  the  sounds  of  our  National  Anthem  playing  at   Buckingham  Palace,  on  the  streets  of  Paris,  and  at  Berlin's  Brandenburg  Gate.    We  will  not  forget  South  Korean  children  gathering  to  pray  outside  our  embassy  in  Seoul,  or   the  prayers  of  sympathy  offered  at  a  mosque  in  Cairo.  We  will  not  forget  moments  of  silence   and  days  of  mourning  in  Australia  and  Africa  and  Latin  America.  Nor  will  we  forget  the  citizens   of  80  other  nations  who  died  with  our  own:  dozens  of  Pakistanis    more  than  130  Israelis     more  than  250  citizens  of  India    men  and  women  from  El  Salvador,  Iran,  Mexico,  and  Japan     and  hundreds  of  British  citizens.  America  has  no  truer  friend  than  Great  Britain.  Once  again,   we  are  joined  together  in  a  great  cause        so  honored  the  British  Prime  Minister  has  crossed   an  ocean  to  show  his  unity  with  America.  Thank  you  for  coming,  friend.   On  September  the  11th,  enemies  of  freedom  committed  an  act  of  war  against  our   country.  Americans  have  known  wars        but  for  the  past  136  years,  they  have  been  wars  on   foreign  soil,  except  for  one  Sunday  in  1941.  Americans  have  known  the  casualties  of  war         but  not  at  the  center  of  a  great  city  on  a  peaceful  morning.  Americans  have  known  surprise   attacks        but  never  before  on  thousands  of  civilians.  All  of  this  was  brought  upon  us  in  a   single  day        and  night  fell  on  a  different  world,  a  world  where  freedom  itself  is  under  attack.   Americans  have  many  questions  tonight.  Americans  are  asking:  Who  attacked  our  country?   The  evidence  we  have  gathered  all  points  to  a  collection  of  loosely  affiliated  terrorist   organizations  known  as  al  Qaeda.  They  are  some  of  the  murderers  indicted  for  bombing   American  embassies  in  Tanzania  and  Kenya,  and  responsible  for  bombing  the  USS  Cole.  Al   Qaeda  is  to  terror  what  the  mafia  is  to  crime.  But  its  goal  is  not  making  money    its  goal  is   remaking  the  world        and  imposing  its  radical  beliefs  on  people  everywhere.   The  terrorists  practice  a  fringe  form  of  Islamic  extremism  that  has  been  rejected  by  Muslim   scholars  and  the  vast  majority  of  Muslim  clerics,  a  fringe  movement  that  perverts  the  peaceful   teachings  of  Islam.  The  terrorists'  directive  commands  them  to  kill  Christians  and  Jews,  to  kill   all  Americans,  and  make  no  distinctions  among  military  and  civilians,  including  women  and   children.  This  group  and  its  leader        a  person  named  Usama  bin  Laden        are  linked  to  many   other  organizations  in  different  countries,  including  the  Egyptian  Islamic  Jihad  and  the  Islamic   Movement  of  Uzbekistan.  There  are  thousands  of  these  terrorists  in  more  than  60  countries.   They  are  recruited  from  their  own  nations  and  neighborhoods  and  brought  to  camps  in  places   like  Afghanistan,  where  they  are  trained  in  the  tactics  of  terror.  They  are  sent  back  to  their   homes  or  sent  to  hide  in  countries  around  the  world  to  plot  evil  and  destruction.   The  leadership  of  al  Qaeda  has  great  influence  in  Afghanistan  and  supports  the  Taliban  regime   in  controlling  most  of  that  country.  In  Afghanistan,  we  see  al  Qaeda's  vision  for  the  world.   Afghanistan's  people  have  been  brutalized    many  are  starving  and  many  have  fled.  Women   are  not  allowed  to  attend  school.  You  can  be  jailed  for  owning  a  television.  Religion  can  be   practiced  only  as  their  leaders  dictate.  A  man  can  be  jailed  in  Afghanistan  if  his  beard  is  not   long  enough.   The  United  States  respects  the  people  of  Afghanistan.  After  all,  we  are  currently  its  largest   source  of  humanitarian  aid    but  we  condemn  the  Taliban  regime.  It  is  not  only  repressing  its   own  people,  it  is  threatening  people  everywhere  by  sponsoring  and  sheltering  and  supplying   terrorists.  By  aiding  and  abetting  murder,  the  Taliban  regime  is  committing  murder.    And  tonight,  the  United  States  of  America  makes  the  following  demands  on  the   Taliban:  Deliver  to  United  States  authorities  all  the  leaders  of  al  Qaeda  who  hide  in  your   land.  Release  all  foreign  nationals,  including  American  citizens,  you  have  unjustly   imprisoned.  Protect  foreign  journalists,  diplomats,  and  aid  workers  in  your  country.  Close   immediately  and  permanently  every  terrorist  training  camp  in  Afghanistan,  and  hand  over   every  terrorist,  and  every  person  in  their  support  structure,  to  appropriate  authorities.  Give   the  United  States  full  access  to  terrorist  training  camps,  so  we  can  make  sure  they  are  no   longer  operating.  These  demands  are  not  open  to  negotiation  or  discussion.  The  Taliban  must   act,  and  act  immediately.  They  will  hand  over  the  terrorists,  or  they  will  share  in  their  fate.   I  also  want  to  speak  tonight  directly  to  Muslims  throughout  the  world.  We  respect  your   faith.  It's  practiced  freely  by  many  millions  of  Americans,  and  by  millions  more  in  countries   that  America  counts  as  friends.  Its  teachings  are  good  and  peaceful,  and  those  who  commit   evil  in  the  name  of  Allah  blaspheme  the  name  of  Allah.  The  terrorists  are  traitors  to  their  own   faith,  trying,  in  effect,  to  hijack  Islam  itself.  The  enemy  of  America  is  not  our  many  Muslim   friends    it  is  not  our  many  Arab  friends.  Our  enemy  is  a  radical  network  of  terrorists,  and   every  government  that  supports  them.  Our  war  on  terror  begins  with  al  Qaeda,  but  it  does  not   end  there.  It  will  not  end  until  every  terrorist  group  of  global  reach  has  been  found,  stopped,   and  defeated.   Americans  are  asking,  why  do  they  hate  us?  They  hate  what  they  see  right  here  in  this   chamber        a  democratically  elected  government.  Their  leaders  are  self  appointed.  They  hate   our  freedoms        our  freedom  of  religion,  our  freedom  of  speech,  our  freedom  to  vote  and   assemble  and  disagree  with  each  other.  They  want  to  overthrow  existing  governments  in   many  Muslim  countries,  such  as  Egypt,  Saudi  Arabia,  and  Jordan.  They  want  to  drive  Israel   out  of  the  Middle  East.  They  want  to  drive  Christians  and  Jews  out  of  vast  regions  of  Asia  and   Africa.  These  terrorists  kill  not  merely  to  end  lives,  but  to  disrupt  and  end  a  way  of  life.  With   every  atrocity,  they  hope  that  America  grows  fearful,  retreating  from  the  world  and  forsaking   our  friends.  They  stand  against  us,  because  we  stand  in  their  way.   We  are  not  deceived  by  their  pretenses  to  piety.  We  have  seen  their  kind  before.  They  are  the   heirs  of  all  the  murderous  ideologies  of  the  20th  century.  By  sacrificing  human  life  to  serve   their  radical  visions        by  abandoning  every  value  except  the  will  to  power        they  follow  in  the   path  of  fascism,  Nazism,  and  totalitarianism.  And  they  will  follow  that  path  all  the  way,  to   where  it  ends:  in  history's  unmarked  grave  of  discarded  lies.  Americans  are  asking:  How  will   we  fight  and  win  this  war?  We  will  direct  every  resource  at  our  command        every  means  of   diplomacy,  every  tool  of  intelligence,  every  instrument  of  law  enforcement,  every  financial   influence,  and  every  necessary  weapon  of  war        to  the  disruption  and  to  the  defeat  of  the   global  terror  network.   Now  this  war  will  not  be  like  the  war  against  Iraq  a  decade  ago,  with  a  decisive  liberation  of   territory  and  a  swift  conclusion.  It  will  not  look  like  the  air  war  above  Kosovo  two  years  ago,   where  no  ground  troops  were  used  and  not  a  single  American  was  lost  in  combat.  Our   response  involves  far  more  than  instant  retaliation  and  isolated  strikes.  Americans  should  not   expect  one  battle,  but  a  lengthy  campaign,  unlike  any  other  we  have  ever  seen.  It  may   include  dramatic  strikes,  visible  on  TV,  and  covert  operations,  secret  even  in  success.    We  will  starve  terrorists  of  funding,  turn  them  one  against  another,  drive  them  from  place  to   place,  until  there  is  no  refuge  or  no  rest.  And  we  will  pursue  nations  that  provide  aid  or  safe   haven  to  terrorism.  Every  nation,  in  every  region,  now  has  a  decision  to  make.  Either  you  are   with  us,  or  you  are  with  the  terrorists.  From  this  day  forward,  any  nation  that  continues  to   harbor  or  support  terrorism  will  be  regarded  by  the  United  States  as  a  hostile  regime.   Our  nation  has  been  put  on  notice:  We're  not  immune  from  attack.  We  will  take  defensive   measures  against  terrorism  to  protect  Americans.  Today,  dozens  of  federal  departments  and   agencies,  as  well  as  state  and  local  governments,  have  responsibilities  affecting  homeland   security.  These  efforts  must  be  coordinated  at  the  highest  level.  So  tonight  I  announce  the   creation  of  a  Cabinet  level  position  reporting  directly  to  me        the  Office  of  Homeland  Security.   And  tonight  I  also  announce  a  distinguished  American  to  lead  this  effort,  to  strengthen   American  security:  a  military  veteran,  an  effective  governor,  a  true  patriot,  a  trusted  friend         Pennsylvania's  Tom  Ridge.  He  will  lead,  oversee,  and  coordinate  a  comprehensive  national   strategy  to  safeguard  our  country  against  terrorism,  and  respond  to  any  attacks  that  may   come.   These  measures  are  essential.  But  the  only  way  to  defeat  terrorism  as  a  threat  to  our  way  of   life  is  to  stop  it,  eliminate  it,  and  destroy  it  where  it  grows.  Many  will  be  involved  in  this  effort,   from  FBI  agents  to  intelligence  operatives  to  the  reservists  we  have  called  to  active  duty.  All   deserve  our  thanks,  and  all  have  our  prayers.  And  tonight,  a  few  miles  from  the  damaged   Pentagon,  I  have  a  message  for  our  military:  Be  ready.  I've  called  the  Armed  Forces  to  alert,   and  there  is  a  reason.  The  hour  is  coming  when  America  will  act,  and  you  will  make  us   proud.  This  is  not,  however,  just  America's  fight.  And  what  is  at  stake  is  not  just  America's   freedom.  This  is  the  world's  fight.  This  is  civilization's  fight.  This  is  the  fight  of  all  who  believe   in  progress  and  pluralism,  tolerance  and  freedom.   We  ask  every  nation  to  join  us.  We  will  ask,  and  we  will  need,  the  help  of  police  forces,   intelligence  services,  and  banking  systems  around  the  world.  The  United  States  is  grateful   that  many  nations  and  many  international  organizations  have  already  responded        with   sympathy  and  with  support.  Nations  from  Latin  America,  to  Asia,  to  Africa,  to  Europe,  to  the   Islamic  world.  Perhaps  the  NATO  Charter  reflects  best  the  attitude  of  the  world:  An  attack  on   one  is  an  attack  on  all.  The  civilized  world  is  rallying  to  America's  side.  They  understand  that  if   this  terror  goes  unpunished,  their  own  cities,  their  own  citizens  may  be  next.  Terror,   unanswered,  can  not  only  bring  down  buildings,  it  can  threaten  the  stability  of  legitimate   governments.  And  you  know  what?  We're  not  going  to  allow  it.   Americans  are  asking:  What  is  expected  of  us?  I  ask  you  to  live  your  lives,  and  hug  your   children.  I  know  many  citizens  have  fears  tonight,  and  I  ask  you  to  be  calm  and  resolute,  even   in  the  face  of  a  continuing  threat.  I  ask  you  to  uphold  the  values  of  America,  and  remember   why  so  many  have  come  here.  We  are  in  a  fight  for  our  principles,  and  our  first  responsibility   is  to  live  by  them.  No  one  should  be  singled  out  for  unfair  treatment  or  unkind  words  because   of  their  ethnic  background  or  religious  faith.  I  ask  you  to  continue  to  support  the  victims  of   this  tragedy  with  your  contributions.  Those  who  want  to  give  can  go  to  a  central  source  of   information,  libertyunites.org,  to  find  the  names  of  groups  providing  direct  help  in  New  York,   Pennsylvania,  and  Virginia.    The  thousands  of  FBI  agents  who  are  now  at  work  in  this  investigation  may  need  your   cooperation,  and  I  ask  you  to  give  it.  I  ask  for  your  patience,  with  the  delays  and   inconveniences  that  may  accompany  tighter  security    and  for  your  patience  in  what  will  be  a   long  struggle.  I  ask  your  continued  participation  and  confidence  in  the  American   economy.  Terrorists  attacked  a  symbol  of  American  prosperity.  They  did  not  touch  its   source.  America  is  successful  because  of  the  hard  work,  and  creativity,  and  enterprise  of  our   people.  These  were  the  true  strengths  of  our  economy  before  September  11th,  and  they  are   our  strengths  today.  And,  finally,  please  continue  praying  for  the  victims  of  terror  and  their   families,  for  those  in  uniform,  and  for  our  great  country.  Prayer  has  comforted  us  in  sorrow,   and  will  help  strengthen  us  for  the  journey  ahead.   Tonight  I  thank  my  fellow  Americans  for  what  you  have  already  done  and  for  what  you  will   do.  And  ladies  and  gentlemen  of  the  Congress,  I  thank  you,  their  representatives,  for  what   you  have  already  done  and  for  what  we  will  do  together.  Tonight,  we  face  new  and  sudden   national  challenges.  We  will  come  together  to  improve  air  safety,  to  dramatically  expand  the   number  of  air  marshals  on  domestic  flights,  and  take  new  measures  to  prevent  hijacking.  We   will  come  together  to  promote  stability  and  keep  our  airlines  flying,  with  direct  assistance   during  this  emergency.  We  will  come  together  to  give  law  enforcement  the  additional  tools  it   needs  to  track  down  terror  here  at  home.  We  will  come  together  to  strengthen  our  intelligence   capabilities  to  know  the  plans  of  terrorists  before  they  act,  and  to  find  them  before  they   strike.   We  will  come  together  to  take  active  steps  that  strengthen  America's  economy,  and  put  our   people  back  to  work.  Tonight  we  welcome  two  leaders  who  embody  the  extraordinary  spirit  of   all  New  Yorkers:  Governor  George  Pataki,  and  Mayor  Rudolph  Giuliani.  As  a  symbol  of   America's  resolve,  my  administration  will  work  with  Congress,  and  these  two  leaders,  to  show   the  world  that  we  will  rebuild  New  York  City.   After  all  that  has  just  passed        all  the  lives  taken,  and  all  the  possibilities  and  hopes  that  died   with  them        it  is  natural  to  wonder  if  America's  future  is  one  of  fear.  Some  speak  of  an  age  of   terror.  I  know  there  are  struggles  ahead,  and  dangers  to  face.   But  this  country  will  define  our   times,  not  be  defined  by  them.   As  long  as  the  United  States  of  America  is  determined  and   strong,  this  will  not  be  an  age  of  terror    this  will  be  an  age  of  liberty,  here  and  across  the   world.   Great  harm  has  been  done  to  us.  We  have  suffered  great  loss.  And  in  our  grief  and  anger  we   have  found  our  mission  and  our  moment.  Freedom  and  fear  are  at  war.  The  advance  of   human  freedom        the  great  achievement  of  our  time,  and  the  great  hope  of  every  time         now  depends  on  us.  Our  nation,  this  generation  will  lift  a  dark  threat  of  violence  from  our   people  and  our  future.  We  will  rally  the  world  to  this  cause  by  our  efforts,  by  our  courage.  We   will  not  tire,  we  will  not  falter,  and  we  will  not  fail.   It  is  my  hope  that  in  the  months  and  years  ahead,  life  will  return  almost  to  normal.  We'll  go   back  to  our  lives  and  routines,  and  that  is  good.  Even  grief  recedes  with  time  and  grace.  But   our  resolve  must  not  pass.  Each  of  us  will  remember  what  happened  that  day,  and  to  whom  it   happened.    We'll  remember  the  moment  the  news  came        where  we  were  and  what  we  were  doing.  Some   will  remember  an  image  of  a  fire,  or  a  story  of  rescue.  Some  will  carry  memories  of  a  face  and   a  voice  gone  forever.   And  I  will  carry  this:  It  is  the  police  shield  of  a  man  named  George  Howard,  who  died  at  the   World  Trade  Center  trying  to  save  others.  It  was  given  to  me  by  his  mom,  Arlene,  as  a  proud   memorial  to  her  son.  This  is  my  reminder  of  lives  that  ended,  and  a  task  that  does  not  end.   I   will  not  forget  this  wound  to  our  country  or  those  who  inflicted  it.  I  will  not  yield    I  will  not   rest    I  will  not  relent  in  waging  this  struggle  for  freedom  and  security  for  the  American  people.   The  course  of  this  conflict  is  not  known,  yet  its  outcome  is  certain.  Freedom  and  fear,  justice   and  cruelty,  have  always  been  at  war,  and  we  know  that  God  is  not  neutral  between  them.   Fellow  citizens,  we'll  meet  violence  with  patient  justice        assured  of  the  rightness  of  our   cause,  and  confident  of  the  victories  to  come.  In  all  that  lies  before  us,  may  God  grant  us   wisdom,  and  may  He  watch  over  the  United  States  of  America.  Thank  you.",bush
"Good afternoon. On my orders, the United States military has begun strikes against Al Qaedaterrorist training camps and military installations of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. Thesecarefully targeted actions are designed to disrupt the use of Afghanistan as a terrorist base ofoperations and to attack the military capability of the Taliban regime. We are joined in this operation by our staunch friend, Great Britain. Other close friends,including Canada, Australia, Germany and France, have pledged forces as the operationunfolds. More than 40 countries in the Middle East, Africa, Europe, and across Asia havegranted air transit or landing rights. Many more have shared intelligence. We are supportedby the collective will of the world. More than two weeks ago, I gave Taliban leaders a series of clear and specific demands: Closeterrorist training camps; hand over leaders of the Al Qaeda network; and return all foreignnationals, including American citizens, unjustly detained in your country. None of thesedemands was met. And now, the Taliban will pay a price. By destroying camps and disrupting communications, we will make it more difficult for theterror network to train new recruits and coordinate their evil plans. Initially the terrorists mayburrow deeper into caves and other entrenched hiding places. Our military action is alsodesigned to clear the way for sustained, comprehensive, and relentless operations to drivethem out and bring them to justice. At the same time, the oppressed people of Afghanistan will know the generosity of Americaand our allies. As we strike military targets, we will also drop food, medicine, and supplies tothe starving and suffering men and women and children of Afghanistan. The United States ofAmerica is a friend to the Afghan people, and we are the friends of almost a billion worldwidewho practice the Islamic faith. The United States of America is an enemy of those who aidterrorists and of the barbaric criminals who profane a great religion by committing murder inits name. This military action is a part of our campaign against terrorism, another front in awar that has already been joined through diplomacy, intelligence, the freezing of financialassets, and the arrests of known terrorists by law-enforcement agents in 38 countries. Given the nature and reach of our enemies, we will win this conflict by the patientaccumulation of successes, by meeting a series of challenges with determination, and will, andpurpose. Today we focus on Afghanistan, but the battle is broader. Every nation has a choiceto make. In this conflict, there is no neutral ground. If any government sponsors the outlawsand killers of innocence, they have become outlaws and murderers themselves. And they willtake that lonely path at their own peril. I'm speaking to you today from the Treaty Room of the White House, a place where Americanpresidents have worked for peace. We're a peaceful nation. Yet, as we have learned, sosuddenly and so tragically, there can be no peace in a world of sudden terror. In the face oftoday's new threat, the only way to pursue peace is to pursue those who threaten it. We didnot ask for this mission, but we will fulfill it. The name of today's military operation is Enduring Freedom. We defend not only our preciousfreedoms, but also the freedom of people everywhere to live and raise their children free fromfear. I know many Americans feel fear today. And our government is taking strong precautions. Alllaw enforcement and intelligence agencies are working aggressively around America, aroundthe world -- and around the clock. At my request, many governors have activated the NationalGuard to strengthen airport security. We have called up reserves to reinforce our militarycapability and strengthen the protection of our homeland. In the months ahead, our patience will be one of our strengths -- patience with the long waitsthat will result from tighter security, patience and understanding that it will take time toachieve our goals, patience in all the sacrifices that may come. Today, those sacrifices arebeing made by members of our armed forces who now defend us so far from home, and bytheir proud and worried families. A Commander-in-Chief sends America's sons and daughters into battle in a foreign land onlyafter the greatest care and a lot of prayer. We ask a lot of those who wear our uniform. Weask them to leave their loved ones, to travel great distances, to risk injury, even to beprepared to make the ultimate sacrifice of their lives. They are dedicated. They are honorable.They represent the best of our country, and we are grateful. To all the men and women in our military -- every sailor, every soldier, every airman, everyCoast Guardsman, every Marine -- I say this: Your mission is defined; your objectives areclear; your goal is just. You have my full confidence, and you will have every tool you need tocarry out your duty. I recently received a touching letter that says a lot about the state of America in these difficulttimes, a letter from a fourth-grade girl with a father in the military: ""As much as I don't wantmy dad to fight,"" she wrote, ""I'm willing to give him to you."" This is a precious gift. Thegreatest she could give. This young girl knows what America is all about. Since September 11,an entire generation of young Americans has gained new understanding of the value offreedom and its cost and duty and its sacrifice. The battle is now joined on many fronts. We will not waiver, we will not tire, we will not falter,and we will not fail. Peace and freedom will prevail. Thank you. May God continue to bless America.",bush
"Please be seated. President and Senator Clinton, thank you all for being here. We have come here to pay our respects to 125 men and women who died in the service of America. We also remember 64 passengers on a hijacked plane; those men and women, boys and girls who fellinto the hands of evildoers, and also died here exactly one month ago. On September 11th, great sorrow came to our country. And from that sorrow has come great resolve. Today, we are a nation awakened to the evil of terrorism, and determined to destroy it. That work began the moment we were attacked; and it will continue until justice isdelivered. Americans are returning, as we must, to the normal pursuits of life. Americans are returning, as we must, to the normal pursuits of life. But we know that if you lost a son or daughter here, or a husband, or a wife, or a mom or dad, life will never again be as it was. The losswas sudden, and hard, and permanent. So difficult to explain. So difficult to accept. Three schoolchildren traveling with their teacher. An Army general. A budget analyst who reported to work here for 30 years. A lieutenant commander in the Naval Reserve who leftbehind a wife, a four-year-old son, and another child on the way. One life touches so many others. One death can leave sorrow that seems almost unbearable. But to all of you who lost someone here, I want to say: You are not alone. The American people will never forget the cruelty that was done here and in New York, and in thesky over Pennsylvania. We will never forget all the innocent people killed by the hatred of a few. We know the loneliness you feel in your loss. The entire nation, the entire nation shares in yoursadness. And we pray for you and your loved ones. And we will always honor their memory. The hijackers were instruments of evil who died in vain. Behind them is a cult of evil which seeks to harm the innocent and thrives on human suffering. Theirs is the worst kind of cruelty, the cruelty that is fed, not weakened, by tears. Theirs is the worst kind of violence, pure malice, while daring to claim the authority of God. We cannot fully understand the designs and power of evil. It is enough to know that evil, like goodness, exists. And in theterrorists, evil has found a willing servant. In New York, the terrorists chose as their target a symbol of America's freedom and confidence. Here, they struck a symbol of our strength in the world. And the attack on the Pentagon, on that day, was more symbolic than they knew. It was on another September 11th -- September 11th, 1941 -- that construction on this building first began. America wasjust then awakening to another menace: The Nazi terror in Europe. And on that very night, President Franklin Roosevelt spoke to the nation. ""The danger,"" he warned, ""has long ceased to be a mere possibility. The danger is here now -- not only from amilitary enemy, but from an enemy of all law, all liberty, all morality, all religion.""1 For us too, in the year 2001, an enemy has emerged that rejects every limit of law, morality, and religion. The terrorists have no true home in any country, or culture, or faith. They dwellin dark corners of earth. And there, we will find them. This week, I have called -- This week, I have called the Armed Forces into action. One by one, we are eliminating power centers of a regime that harbors al Qaeda terrorists. We gavethat regime a choice: Turn over the terrorists, or face your ruin. They chose unwisely. The Taliban regime has brought nothing but fear and misery to the people of Afghanistan. These rulers call themselves holy men, even with their record of drawing money from heroin trafficking. They consider themselves pious and devout, while subjecting womento fierce brutality. The Taliban has allied itself with murderers and gave them shelter. But today, for al Qaeda and the Taliban, there is no shelter. As Americans did 60 years ago, we have entered a struggle of uncertain duration. But now, as then, we can be certain of the outcome, becausewe have a number of decisive assets. We have a unified country. We have the patience to fight and win on many fronts: Blocking terrorist plans, seizing their funds, arresting their networks, disrupting their communications, opposing their sponsors. And we have one more great asset in this cause: The brave menand women of the United States military. From my first days in this office, I have felt and seen the strong spirit of the Armed Forces. I saw it at Fort Stewart, Georgia, when I first reviewed our troops as Commander-in-Chief, and looked into the faces of proud and determined soldiers. I saw it in Annapolis on a graduation day; at Camp Pendleton in California; Camp Bondsteel in Kosovo. And I have seenthis spirit at the Pentagon, before and after the attack on this building. You've responded to a great emergency with calm and courage. And for that, your country honors you. A Commander-in-Chief must know -- must know -- that he can count on the skill and readiness of servicemen and women at every point in the chain of command. You havegiven me that confidence. And I give you these commitments. The wound to this building will not be forgotten, but it will be repaired. Brick by brick, we will quickly rebuild the Pentagon. In the missions ahead for the military, you will have everything you need, every resource, every weapon, everymeans to assure full victory for the United States and the cause of freedom. And I pledge to you that America will never relent on this war against terror. There will be times of swift, dramatic action. There will be times of steady, quiet progress. Over time, with patience, and precision, the terrorists will be pursued. They will be isolated, surrounded,cornered, until there is no place to run, or hide, or rest. As military and civilian personnel in the Pentagon, you are an important part of the struggle we have entered. You know the risks of your calling, and you have willingly acceptedthem. You believe in our country, and our country believes in you. Within sight of this building is Arlington [National] Cemetery, the final resting place of many thousands who died for our country over the generations. Enemies of America have now added to these graves, and they wish to add more. Unlike our enemies, we value every life,and we mourn every loss. Yet we're not afraid. Our cause is just, and worthy of sacrifice. Our nation is strong of heart, firm of purpose. Inspired by all the courage that has come before, we will meet our momentand we will prevail. May God bless you all, and may God bless America. 1 Roosevelt, F.D. (September 11, 1941). Fireside Chat 18: On The Greer Incident.",bush
"Good morning and welcome to the White House. Today, we take an essential step in defeating terrorism, while protecting the constitutional rights of all Americans. With my signature, this law will give intelligence and law enforcement officials important new tools tofight a present danger. I commend the House and Senate for the hard work they put into this legislation. Members of Congress and their staffs spent long nights and weekends to get this important bill to mydesk. I appreciate their efforts, and bipartisanship, in passing this new law. I want to thank the Vice President and his staff for working hard to make sure this law was passed. I want to thank the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Treasury for being here, both of whom lead important parts of our war against terrorism. I want to thank Attorney General John Ashcroft for spending a lot of time on the Hill to make the case for a balanced piece of legislation. I want to thank the Director of the FBI and the Director of the CIA for waging an incredibly important part on the two-front war -- one overseas, and a front here athome. I want to thank Governor Tom Ridge for his leadership. I want to thank the members of Congress who are here on the stage, the Leaders, on this impressive effort. Senator Hatchand Senator Leahy and Senator Sarbanes and Senator Graham and Senator Reid. I also want to thank Representative Porter Goss, LaFalce, Oxley, and Sensenbrenner for their hard work. And I want to welcome the men and women of law enforcement who are here inthe White House with us today, as well. The changes, effective today, will help counter a threat like no other our nation has ever faced. We've seen the enemy, and the murder of thousands of innocent, unsuspecting people. They recognize no barrier of morality. They have no conscience. The terroristscannot be reasoned with. Witness the recent anthrax attacks through our Postal Service. Our country is grateful for the courage the Postal Service has shown during these difficult times. We mourn the loss of the lives of Thomas Morris and Joseph Curseen; postal workerswho died in the line of duty. And our prayers go to their loved ones. I want to assure postal workers that our government is testing more than 200 postal facilities along the entire Eastern corridor that may have been impacted. And we will move quickly totreat and protect workers where positive exposures are found. But one thing is for certain: These terrorists must be pursued, they must be defeated, and they must be brought to justice. (Applause.) And that is the purpose of this legislation. Since the 11th of September, the men and women of our intelligence and lawenforcement agencies have been relentless in their response to new and sudden challenges. We have seen the horrors terrorists can inflict. We may never know what horrors our country was spared by the diligent and determined work of our police forces, the FBI, ATF agents, federal marshals, Custom officers, Secret Service, intelligence professionals and local law enforcement officials, under the most trying conditions. They are serving this country withexcellence, and often with bravery. They deserve our full support and every means of help that we can provide. We're dealing with terrorists who operate by highly sophisticated methods and technologies, some of which were not even available when our existing laws were written. The bill before me takes account of the new realities and dangers posed by modern terrorists. It will help lawenforcement to identify, to dismantle, to disrupt, and to punish terrorists before they strike. For example, this legislation gives law enforcement officials better tools to put an end to financial counterfeiting, smuggling and money-laundering. Secondly, it gives intelligence operations and criminal operations the chance to operate not on separate tracks, but to sharevital information so necessary to disrupt a terrorist attack before it occurs. As of today, we're changing the laws governing information-sharing. And as importantly, we're changing the culture of our various agencies that fight terrorism. Countering and investigating terrorist activity is the number one priority for both law enforcement andintelligence agencies. Surveillance of communications is another essential tool to pursue and stop terrorists. The existing law was written in the era of rotary telephones. This new law that I sign today will allow surveillance of all communications used by terrorists, including e-mails, the Internet,and cell phones. As of today, we'll be able to better meet the technological challenges posed by this proliferation of communications technology. Investigations are often slowed by limit on thereach of federal search warrants. Law enforcement agencies have to get a new warrant for each new district they investigate, even when they're after the same suspect. Under this new law, warrants are valid across all districts and across all states. And, finally, the new legislation greatly enhances the penaltiesthat will fall on terrorists or anyone who helps them. Current statutes deal more severely with drug-traffickers than with terrorists. That changes today. We are enacting new and harsh penalties for possession of biological weapons. We're making it easier to seize the assets of groups and individuals involved in terrorism. The government will have wider latitude in deporting known terrorists and their supporters. The statute of limitations on terrorist acts will be lengthened, as will prison sentences forterrorists. This bill was carefully drafted and considered. Led by the members of Congress on this stage, and those seated in the audience, it was crafted with skill and care, determination and a spirit of bipartisanship for which the entire nation is grateful. This bill met with an overwhelming -- overwhelming agreement in Congress, because it upholds and respects the civil libertiesguaranteed by our Constitution. This legislation is essential not only to pursuing and punishing terrorists, but also preventing more atrocities in the hands of the evil ones. This government will enforce this law with all the urgency of a nation at war. The elected branches of our government, and both political parties, are united in our resolve to fight and stop and punish those who would do harm to theAmerican people. It is now my honor to sign into law the USA Patriot Act of 2001.",bush
"We meet in a hall devoted to peace, in a city scarred by violence, in a nation awakened to danger, in a world uniting for a long struggle. Every civilized nation here today is resolved to keep the most basic commitment of civilization: We will defend ourselves and our futureagainst terror and lawless violence. The United Nations was founded in this cause. In a second world war, we learned there is no isolation from evil. We affirmed that some crimes are so terrible they offend humanity, itself. And we resolved that the aggressions and ambitions of the wicked must be opposed early, decisively, and collectively, before they threaten us all. That evil has returned, and thatcause is renewed. A few miles from here, many thousands still lie in a tomb of rubble. Tomorrow, the Secretary General, the President of the General Assembly, and I will visit that site, where the names of every nation and region that lost citizens will be read aloud. If we were to read the names ofevery person who died, it would take more than three hours. Those names include a citizen of Gambia, whose wife spent their fourth wedding anniversary, September the 12th, searching in vain for her husband. Those names include a man who supported his wife in Mexico, sending home money every week. Those names include a young Pakistani who prayed toward Mecca five times a day, and died that day trying to saveothers. The suffering of September the 11th was inflicted on people of many faiths and many nations. All of the victims, including Muslims, were killed with equal indifference and equal satisfaction by the terrorist leaders. The terrorists are violating the tenets of every religion,including the one they invoke. Last week, the Sheikh of Al-Azhar University, the world's oldest Islamic institution of higher learning, declared that terrorism is a disease, and that Islam prohibits killing innocent civilians. The terrorists call their cause holy, yet, they fund it with drug dealing; they encourage murder and suicide in the name of a great faith that forbids both. They dare to ask God's blessing as they set out to kill innocent men, women and children. But the God of Isaac and Ishmael would never answer such a prayer. And a murderer is not a martyr; he is just amurderer. Time is passing. Yet, for the United States of America, there will be no forgetting September the 11th. We will remember every rescuer who died in honor. We will remember every family that lives in grief. We will remember the fire and ash, the last phone calls, the funerals of thechildren. And the people of my country will remember those who have plotted against us. We are learning their names. We are coming to know their faces. There is no corner of the Earthdistant or dark enough to protect them. However long it takes, their hour of justice will come. Every nation has a stake in this cause. As we meet, the terrorists are planning more murder - - perhaps in my country, or perhaps in yours. They kill because they aspire todominate. They seek to overthrow governments and destabilize entire regions. Last week, anticipating this meeting of the General Assembly, they denounced the United Nations. They called our Secretary General a criminal and condemned all Arab nations hereas traitors to Islam. Few countries meet their exacting standards of brutality and oppression. Every other country is a potential target. And all the world faces the most horrifying prospect of all: These same terrorists are searching for weapons of mass destruction, the tools to turn their hatred into holocaust. They can be expected to use chemical, biological and nuclear weapons themoment they are capable of doing so. No hint of conscience would prevent it. This threat cannot be ignored. This threat cannot be appeased. Civilization, itself, the civilization we share, is threatened. History will record our response, and judge or justifyevery nation in this hall. The civilized world is now responding. We act to defend ourselves and deliver our children from a future of fear. We choose the dignity of life over a culture of death. We choose lawful change and civil disagreement over coercion, subversion, and chaos. These commitments -- hope and order, law and life -- unite people across cultures and continents. Upon these commitments depend all peace and progress. For these commitments, we are determined tofight. The United Nations has risen to this responsibility. On the 12th of September, these buildings opened for emergency meetings of the General Assembly and the Security Council. Before the sun had set, these attacks on the world stood condemned by the world. And I want tothank you for this strong and principled stand. I also thank the Arab Islamic countries that have condemned terrorist murder. Many of you have seen the destruction of terror in your own lands. The terrorists are increasingly isolated by their own hatred and extremism. They cannot hide behind Islam. The authors of massmurder and their allies have no place in any culture, and no home in any faith. The conspiracies of terror are being answered by an expanding global coalition. Not every nation will be a part of every action against the enemy. But every nation in our coalition has duties. These duties can be demanding, as we in America are learning. We have already made adjustments in our laws and in our daily lives. We're taking new measures toinvestigate terror and to protect against threats. The leaders of all nations must now carefully consider their responsibilities and their future. Terrorist groups like al Qaeda depend upon the aid or indifference of governments. They need the support of a financial infrastructure, and safe havens to trainand plan and hide. Some nations want to play their part in the fight against terror, but tell us they lack the means to enforce their laws and control their borders. We stand ready to help. Some governments still turn a blind eye to the terrorists, hoping the threat will pass them by. They are mistaken. And some governments, while pledging to uphold the principles of the U.N., have cast their lot with the terrorists. They support them and harbor them, and they will findthat their welcome guests are parasites that will weaken them, and eventually consume them. For every regime that sponsors terror, there is a price to be paid. And it will be paid. Theallies of terror are equally guilty of murder and equally accountable to justice. The Taliban are now learning this lesson -- that regime and the terrorists who support it are now virtually indistinguishable. Together they promote terror abroad and impose a reign of terror on the Afghan people. Women are executed in Kabal's soccer stadium. They can bebeaten for wearing socks that are too thin. Men are jailed for missing prayer meetings. The United States, supported by many nations, is bringing justice to the terrorists in Afghanistan. We're making progress against military targets, and that is our objective. Unlikethe enemy, we seek to minimize, not maximize, the loss of innocent life. I'm proud of the honorable conduct of the American military. And my country grieves for all the suffering the Taliban have brought upon Afghanistan, including the terrible burden of war. The Afghan people do not deserve their present rulers. Years of Taliban misrule have brought nothing but misery and starvation. Even before this current crisis, 4 million Afghans depended on food from the United Statesand other nations, and millions of Afghans were refugees from Taliban oppression. I make this promise to all the victims of that regime: The Taliban's days of harboring terrorists and dealing in heroin and brutalizing women are drawing to a close. And when thatregime is gone, the people of Afghanistan will say with the rest of the world: good riddance. I can promise, too, that America will join the world in helping the people of Afghanistan rebuild their country. Many nations, including mine, are sending food and medicine to help Afghans through the winter. America has air-dropped over 1.3 million packages of rations into Afghanistan. Just this week, we air-lifted 20,000 blankets and over 200 tons of provisions into the region. We continue to provide humanitarian aid, even while the Taliban tried to stealthe food we send. More help eventually will be needed. The United States will work closely with the United Nations and development banks to reconstruct Afghanistan after hostilities there have ceased and the Taliban are no longer in control. And the United States will work with the U.N. tosupport a post-Taliban government that represents all of the Afghan people. In this war of terror, each of us must answer for what we have done or what we have left undone. After tragedy, there is a time for sympathy and condolence. And my country has been very grateful for both. The memorials and vigils around the world will not beforgotten. But the time for sympathy has now passed; the time for action has now arrived. The most basic obligations in this new conflict have already been defined by the United Nations. On September the 28th, the Security Council adopted Resolution 1373. Its requirements are clear: Every United Nations member has a responsibility to crack down on terrorist financing. We must pass all necessary laws in our own countries to allow the confiscation of terrorist assets. We must apply those laws to every financial institution inevery nation. We have a responsibility to share intelligence and coordinate the efforts of law enforcement. If you know something, tell us. If we know something, we'll tell you. And when we find the terrorists, we must work together to bring them to justice. We have a responsibility to deny any sanctuary, safe haven or transit to terrorists. Every known terrorist camp must be shut down, its operators apprehended, and evidence of their arrest presented to the United Nations. We have a responsibility to deny weapons toterrorists and to actively prevent private citizens from providing them. These obligations are urgent and they are binding on every nation with a place in this chamber. Many governments are taking these obligations seriously, and my country appreciates it. Yet, even beyond Resolution 1373, more is required, and more is expected ofour coalition against terror. We're asking for a comprehensive commitment to this fight. We must unite in opposing all terrorists, not just some of them. In this world there are good causes and bad causes, and we may disagree on where the line is drawn. Yet, there is no such thing as a good terrorist. No national aspiration, no remembered wrong can ever justify the deliberate murder of the innocent. Any government that rejects this principle, trying to pick and choose itsterrorist friends, will know the consequences. We must speak the truth about terror. Let us never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning the attacks of September the 11th; malicious lies that attempt to shift the blame away from the terrorists, themselves, away from the guilty. To inflame ethnic hatred is toadvance the cause of terror. The war against terror must not serve as an excuse to persecute ethnic and religious minorities in any country. Innocent people must be allowed to live their own lives, by their own customs, under their own religion. And every nation must have avenues for the peaceful expression of opinion and dissent. When these avenues are closed, the temptation to speakthrough violence grows. We must press on with our agenda for peace and prosperity in every land. My country is pledged to encouraging development and expanding trade. My country is pledged to investing in education and combating AIDS and other infectious diseases around the world. Following September 11th, these pledges are even more important. In our struggle against hatefulgroups that exploit poverty and despair, we must offer an alternative of opportunity and hope. The American government also stands by its commitment to a just peace in the Middle East. We are working toward a day when two states, Israel and Palestine, live peacefully together within secure and recognize borders as called for by the Security Council resolutions. We will do all in our power to bring both parties back into negotiations. Butpeace will only come when all have sworn off, forever, incitement, violence and terror. And, finally, this struggle is a defining moment for the United Nations, itself. And the world needs its principled leadership. It undermines the credibility of this great institution, for example, when the Commission on Human Rights offers seats to the world's most persistent The steps I described will not be easy. For all nations, they will require effort. For some nations, they will require great courage. Yet, the cost of inaction is far greater. The onlyalternative to victory is a nightmare world where every city is a potential killing field. As I've told the American people, freedom and fear are at war. We face enemies that hate not our policies, but our existence; the tolerance of openness and creative culture that defines us. But the outcome of this conflict is certain: There is a current in history and it runs toward freedom. Our enemies resent it and dismiss it, but the dreams of mankind are defined by liberty -- the natural right to create and build and worship and live in dignity. When men and women are released from oppression and isolation, they find fulfillment and hope, and theyleave poverty by the millions. These aspirations are lifting up the peoples of Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas, and theycan lift up all of the Islamic world. We stand for the permanent hopes of humanity, and those hopes will not be denied. We're confident, too, that history has an author who fills time and eternity with his purpose. We know that evil is real, but good will prevail against it. This is the teaching of many faiths, andin that assurance we gain strength for a long journey. It is our task -- the task of this generation -- to provide the response to aggression andterror. We have no other choice, because there is no other peace. We did not ask for this mission, yet there is honor in history's call. We have a chance to write the story of our times, a story of courage defeating cruelty and light overcoming darkness. This calling is worthy of any life, and worthy of every nation. So let us go forward,confident, determined, and unafraid. Thank you very much.",bush
"Thank you, all. Chief Justice Rehnquist, President Carter, President Bush, President Clinton, distinguishedguests and my fellow citizens: The peaceful transfer of authority is rare in history, yet common in our country. With a simpleoath, we affirm old traditions and make new beginnings. As I begin, I thank President Clinton for his service to our nation. And I thank Vice President Gore for a contest conducted with spirit and ended with grace. I am honored and humbled to stand here, where so many of America's leaders have comebefore me, and so many will follow. We have a place, all of us, in a long story -- a story we continue, but whose end we will notsee. It is a story of a new world that became a friend and liberator of the old, a story of aslave-holding society that became a servant of freedom, the story of a power that went intothe world to protect but not possess, to defend but not to conquer. It is the American story -- a story of flawed and fallible people, united across the generationsby grand and enduring ideals. The grandest of these ideals is an unfolding American promisethat everyone belongs, that everyone deserves a chance, that no insignificant person wasever born. Americans are called to enact this promise in our lives and in our laws. And thoughour nation has sometimes halted, and sometimes delayed, we must follow no other course. Through much of the last century, America's faith in freedom and democracy was a rock in araging sea. Now it is a seed upon the wind, taking root in many nations. Our democratic faithis more than the creed of our country, it is the inborn hope of our humanity, an ideal we carrybut do not own, a trust we bear and pass along. And even after nearly 225 years, we have along way yet to travel. While many of our citizens prosper, others doubt the promise, even the justice, of our owncountry. The ambitions of some Americans are limited by failing schools and hidden prejudiceand the circumstances of their birth. And sometimes our differences run so deep, it seems weshare a continent, but not a country. We do not accept this, and we will not allow it. Ourunity, our union, is the serious work of leaders and citizens in every generation. And this is my solemn pledge: I will work to build a single nation of justice and opportunity. I know this is in our reach because we are guided by a Power larger than ourselves whocreates us equal in His image. And we are confident in principles that unite and lead us onward. America has never beenunited by blood or birth or soil. We are bound by ideals that move us beyond ourbackgrounds, lift us above our interests and teach us what it means to be citizens. Every childmust be taught these principles. Every citizen must uphold them. And every immigrant, byembracing these ideals, makes our country more, not less, American. Today -- Today we affirm a new commitment to live out our nation's promise through civility,courage, compassion, and character. America, at its best, matches a commitment to principlewith a concern for civility. A civil society demands from each of us good will and respect, fairdealing and forgiveness. Some seem to believe that our politics can afford to be petty because, in a time of peace, thestakes of our debates appear small. But the stakes for America are never small. If our countrydoes not lead the cause of freedom, it will not be led. If we do not turn the hearts of childrentoward knowledge and character, we will lose their gifts and undermine their idealism. If wepermit our economy to drift and decline, the vulnerable will suffer most. We must live up to the calling we share. Civility is not a tactic or a sentiment. It is thedetermined choice of trust over cynicism, of community over chaos. And this commitment, ifwe keep it, is a way to shared accomplishment. America, at its best, is also courageous. Our national courage has been clear in times ofdepression and war, when defeating common dangers defined our common good. Now wemust choose if the example of our fathers and mothers will inspire us or condemn us. Wemust show courage in a time of blessing by confronting problems instead of passing them onto future generations. Together, we will reclaim America's schools, before ignorance and apathy claim more younglives. We will reform Social Security and Medicare, sparing our children from struggles wehave the power to prevent. And we'll reduce taxes, to recover the momentum of our economyand reward the effort and enterprise of working Americans. We will build our defenses beyondchallenge, lest weakness invite challenge. We will confront weapons of mass destruction, sothat a new century is spared new horrors. The enemies of liberty and our country should make no mistake: America remains engaged inthe world by history and by choice, shaping a balance of power that favors freedom. We willdefend our allies and our interests. We will show purpose without arrogance. We will meetaggression and bad faith with resolve and strength. And to all nations, we will speak for thevalues that gave our nation birth. America, at its best, is compassionate. In the quiet of American conscience, we know thatdeep, persistent poverty is unworthy of our nation's promise. And whatever our views of itscause, we can agree that children at risk are not at fault. Abandonment and abuse are notacts of God, they are failures of love. And the proliferation of prisons, however necessary, isno substitute for hope and order in our souls. Where there is suffering, there is duty.Americans in need are not strangers, they are citizens, not problems, but priorities. And all ofus are diminished when any are hopeless. Government has great responsibilities for public safety and public health, for civil rights andcommon schools. Yet compassion is the work of a nation, not just a government. And someneeds and hurts are so deep they will only respond to a mentor's touch or a pastor's prayer.Church and charity, synagogue and mosque lend our communities their humanity, and theywill have an honored place in our plans and in our laws. Many in our country do not know the pain of poverty, but we can listen to those who do. And Ican pledge our nation to a goal: When we see that wounded traveler on the road to Jericho,we will not pass to the other side. America, at its best, is a place where personal responsibility is valued and expected.Encouraging responsibility is not a search for scapegoats, it is a call to conscience. And thoughit requires sacrifice, it brings a deeper fulfillment. We find the fullness of life not only inoptions, but in commitments. And we find that children and community are the commitmentsthat set us free. Our public interest depends on private character, on civic duty and family bonds and basicfairness, on -- on uncounted, unhonored acts of decency which give direction to our freedom.Sometimes in life we're called to do great things. But as a saint of our times has said, everyday we are called to ""do small things with great love.""   The most important tasks of ademocracy are done by everyone. I will live and lead by these principles: to advance my convictions with civility, to pursue thepublic interest with courage, to speak for greater justice and compassion, to call forresponsibility and try to live it as well. In all these ways, I will bring the values of our historyto the care of our times. What you do is as important as anything government does. I ask you to seek a common goodbeyond your comfort; to defend needed reforms against easy attacks; to serve your nation,beginning with your neighbor. I ask you to be citizens: citizens, not spectators; citizens, notsubjects; responsible citizens, building communities of service and a nation of character. Americans are generous and strong and decent, not because we believe in ourselves, butbecause we hold beliefs beyond ourselves. When this spirit of citizenship is missing, nogovernment program can replace it. When this spirit is present, no wrong can stand against it. Much time has passed since Jefferson arrived for his inauguration. The years and changesaccumulate. But the themes of this day he would know: our nation's grand story of courageand its simple dream of dignity. We are not this story's Author, who fills time and eternity with His purpose. Yet His purpose isachieved in our duty, and our duty is fulfilled in service to one another. Never tiring, never yielding, never finishing, we renew that purpose today, to make ourcountry more just and generous, to affirm the dignity of our lives and every life. This work continues. The story goes on. And an angel still rides in the whirlwind and directsthis storm. God bless you all, and God bless America.",bush
"I'm glad to be back here at the Citadel. I have come to talk about the future security of our country, in a place where I took up this subject two years ago when I was candidate for President. In September 1999, I said here at the Citadel that America was entering a period of consequences that would be defined by the threat of terror, and that we faced a challenge of military transformation. That threat has now revealed itself, and that challenge is now the military and moral necessity of our time. So,today, I will set forth the commitments essential to victory in our war against terror. I want to thank Major General John Grinalds for his hospitality. I want to thank the Citadel Board of Visitors, the staff, and the faculty. I understand the Governor is here. And I know my friends, the Lt. Governor, the Speaker and the Attorney General are here, and it was great to have seen them at the airport. I thank my friend, Adjutant General Stan Spears for beinghere. I'm grateful that Senator Hollings and members of the South Carolina congressional delegation flew down on Air Force One. I only wish that the senior Senator was on theairplane so I could have wished him a happy 99th birthday. But most of all, most of all, I want to say how much I appreciate being in the presence ofsome of America's finest, the South Carolina Corp of Cadets of Citadel. Four days ago, I joined the men and women of the USS Enterprise to mark the 60th anniversary of Pearl Harbor. December 7th, 1941 was a decisive day that changed our nation forever. In a single moment, America's ""splendid isolation"" was ended. And the four yearsthat followed transformed the American way of war. The age of battleships gave way to the offensive capability of aircraft carriers. The tank, once used only to protect infantry, now served to cut through enemy lines. At Guadalcanal, and Normandy, and Iwo Jima, amphibious warfare proved its worth. And by war's end, no onewould ever again doubt the value of strategic air power. Even more importantly, an American President and his successors shaped a world beyond a war. They rebuilt Europe with the Marshall Plan, formed a great alliance for freedom in NATO, and expressed the hope of collective security in the United Nations. America took the lead,becoming freedom's defender and assuming responsibilities that only we could bear. September 11th, 2001 -- three months and a long time ago -- set another dividing line in our lives and in the life of our nation. An illusion of immunity was shattered. A faraway evil became a present danger. And a great cause became clear: We will fight terror and thosewho sponsor it, to save our children from a future of fear. To win this war, we have to think differently. The enemy who appeared on September 11th seeks to evade our strength and constantly searches for our weaknesses. So America is required once again to change the way our military thinks and fights. And starting on October 7th, the enemy in Afghanistan got the first glimpses of a new American military that cannot,and will not, be evaded. When I committed U.S. forces to this battle, I had every confidence that they would be up to the task. And they have proven me right. The Taliban and the terrorists set out to dominate a country and intimidate the world. Today, from their caves, it's all looking a little different. And no cave is deep enough to escape the patient justice of the United States ofAmerica. We are also beginning to see the possibilities of a world beyond the war on terror. We have a chance, if we take it, to write a hopeful chapter in human history. All at once, a new threat to civilization is erasing old lines of rivalry and resentment between nations. Russia and America are building a new cooperative relationship. India and the United States are increasingly aligned across a range of issues, even as we work closely with Pakistan. Germany and Japanare assuming new military roles, appropriate to their status as great democracies. The vast majority of countries are now on the same side of a moral and ideological divide. We're making common cause with every nation that chooses lawful change overchaotic violence -- every nation that values peace and safety and innocent life. Staring across this divide are bands of murderers, supported by outlaw regimes. They are a movement defined by their hatreds. They hate progress, and freedom, and choice, and culture, and music, and laughter, and women, and Christians, and Jews, and all Muslims who reject their distorted doctrines. They love only one thing -- they love power. And when theyhave it, they use it without mercy. The great threat to civilization is not that the terrorists will inspire millions. Only the terrorists themselves would want to live in their brutal and joyless world. The great threat to civilization is that a few evil men will multiply their murders, and gain the means to kill on a scale equalto their hatred. We know they have this mad intent, and we're determined to stop them. Our lives, our way of life, and our every hope for the world depend on a single commitment: The authors of mass murder must be defeated, and never allowed to gain oruse the weapons of mass destruction. America and our friends will meet this threat with every method at our disposal. We will discover and destroy sleeper cells. We will track terrorist movements, trace theircommunications, disrupt their funding, and take their network apart, piece by piece. Above all, we're acting to end the state sponsorship of terror. Rogue states are clearly the most likely sources of chemical and biological and nuclear weapons for terrorists. Every nation now knows that we cannot accept -- and we will not accept -- states that harbor, finance, train, or equip the agents of terror. Those nations that violate this principle will be regarded as hostile regimes. They have been warned, they are being watched, and they willbe held to account. Preventing mass terror will be the responsibilities of Presidents far into the future. And this obligation sets three urgent and enduring priorities for America. The first priority is to speedthe transformation of our military. When the Cold War ended, some predicted that the era of direct threats to our nation was over. Some thought our military would be used overseas -- not to win wars, but mainly topolice and pacify, to control crowds and contain ethnic conflict. They were wrong. While the threats to America have changed, the need for victory has not. We are fighting shadowy, entrenched enemies -- enemies using the tools of terror and guerrilla war -- yet we are finding new tactics and new weapons to attack and defeat them. This revolution in ourmilitary is only beginning, and it promises to change the face of battle. Afghanistan has been a proving ground for this new approach. These past two months have shown that an innovative doctrine and high-tech weaponry can shape and then dominate an unconventional conflict. The brave men and women of our military are rewriting the rules of war with new technologies and old values like courage and honor. And they have made thisnation proud. Our commanders are gaining a real-time picture of the entire battlefield, and are able to get targeting information from sensor to shooter almost instantly. Our intelligence professionals and special forces have cooperated in battle-friendly -- with battle-friendly Afghan forces -- fighters who know the terrain, who know the Taliban, and who understand the local culture. And our special forces have the technology to call in precision air strikes -- along with the flexibility to direct those strikes from horseback, in the first cavalry charge of the 21stcentury. This combination -- real-time intelligence, local allied forces, special forces, and precision air power -- has really never been used before. The conflict in Afghanistan has taught us more about the future of our military than a decade of blue ribbon panels and think-tanksymposiums. The Predator is a good example. This unmanned aerial vehicle is able to circle over enemy forces, gather intelligence, transmit information instantly back to commanders, then fire ontargets with extreme accuracy. Before the war, the Predator had skeptics, because it did not fit the old ways. Now it is clear the military does not have enough unmanned vehicles. We're entering an era in which unmanned vehicles of all kinds will take on greater importance -- in space, on land, in the air,and at sea. Precision-guided munitions also offer great promise. In the Gulf War, these weapons were the exception -- while in Afghanistan, they have been the majority of the munitions we have used. We're striking with greater effectiveness, at greater range, with fewer civilian casualties. More and more, our weapons can hit moving targets. When all of our military can continuously locate and track moving targets -- with surveillance from air and space --warfare will be truly revolutionized. The need for military transformation was clear before the conflict in Afghanistan, and before September the 11th. Here at the Citadel in 1999, I spoke of keeping the peace by redefining war on our terms. The same recommendation was made in the strategic review that Secretary Rumsfeld briefed me on last August -- a review that I fully endorse. What's different today is our sense of urgency -- the need to build this future force while fighting a present war. It's like overhauling an engine while you're going at 80 miles an hour. Yet wehave no other choice. Our military has a new and essential mission. For states that support terror, it's not enough that the consequences be costly -- they must be devastating. The more credible this reality, the more likely that regimes will change their behavior -- making it less likely that Americaand our friends will need to use overwhelming force against them. To build our future force, the Armed Services must continue to attract America's best people, with good pay and good living conditions. Our military culture must reward new thinking, innovation, and experimentation. Congress must give defense leaders the freedom to innovate, instead of micromanaging the Defense Department. And every service and every constituency of our military must be willing to sacrifice some of their own pet projects. Our war on terror cannot be used to justify obsolete bases, obsolete programs, or obsolete weapon systems. Every dollar of defense spending must meet a single test: It must help usbuild the decisive power we will need to win the wars of the future. Our country is united in supporting a great cause -- and in supporting those who fight for it. We will give our men and women in uniform every resource, every weapon, every toolthey need to win the long battle that lies ahead. America's next priority to prevent mass terror is to protect against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them. I wish I could report to the American people that this threat does not exist -- that our enemy is content with car bombsand box cutters -- but I cannot. One former al Qaeda member has testified in court that he was involved in an effort 10 years ago to obtain nuclear materials. And the leader of al Qaeda calls that effort ""a religious duty."" Abandoned al Qaeda houses in Kabul contained diagrams for crude weapons of mass destruction. And as we all know, terrorists have put anthrax into the U.S. mail, and usedsarin gas in a Tokyo subway. And almost every state that actively sponsors terror is known to be seeking weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them at longer and longer ranges. Their hope is to blackmail the United States into abandoning our war on terror, and forsaking our friends and allies and security commitments around the world. Our enemies are bound for disappointment. America will never be blackmailed, and we will never forsake ourcommitment to liberty. To meet our new threats, I have directed my National Security Advisor and my Homeland Security Director to develop a comprehensive strategy on proliferation. Working with other countries, we will strengthen nonproliferation treaties and toughen export controls. Together, we must keep the world's most dangerous technologies out of the hands of theworld's most dangerous people. A crucial partner in this effort is Russia -- a nation we are helping to dismantle strategic weapons, reduce nuclear material, and increase security at nuclear sites. Our two countries will expand efforts to provide peaceful employment for scientists who formerly worked in Soviet weapons facilities. The United States will also work with Russia to build a facility to destroy tons of nerve agent. I'll request an over-all increase in funding to support this vitalmission. Even as we fight to prevent proliferation, we must prepare for every possibility. At home, we must be better prepared to detect, protect against, and respond to the potential use of weapons of mass destruction. Abroad, our military forces must have the ability to fight andwin against enemies who would use such weapons against us. Biodefense has become a major initiative of ours. This year we've already requested nearly $3 billion additional dollars for biodefense, more than doubling the level of funding prior toSeptember the 11th. The attacks on our nation made it even more clear that we need to build limited and effective defenses against a missile attack. Our enemies seek every chance and every means to doharm to our country, our forces, and our friends. And we will not permit it. Suppose the Taliban and the terrorists had been able to strike America or important allies with a ballistic missile. Our coalition would have become fragile, the stakes in our war much, much higher. We must protect Americans and our friends against all forms of terror, including theterror that could arrive on a missile. Last week we conducted another promising test of our missile defense technology. For the good of peace, we're moving forward with an active program to determine what works and what does not work. In order to do so, we must move beyond the 1972 Anti-Ballistic MissileTreaty, a treaty that was written in a different era, for a different enemy. America and our allies must not be bound to the past. We must be able to build the defenseswe need against the enemies of the 21st century. Our third and final priority in the fight against mass terror is to strengthen the advantage that good intelligence gives our country. Every day I make decisions influenced by the intelligence briefing of that morning. To reach decisions, a President needs more than data and information. A President needs real and current knowledge and analysis of the plans,intentions, and capabilities of our enemies. The last several months have shown that there is no substitute for good intelligence officers, people on the ground. These are the people who find the targets, follow our enemies, andhelp us disrupt their evil plans. The United States must rebuild our network of human intelligence. And we will apply the best new technology to gather intelligence on the new threats. Sophisticated systems like Global Hawk, an unmanned surveillance plane, are transforming our intelligence capabilities. Ourtechnological strengths produce great advantages, and we will build on them. Our intelligence services and federal law enforcement agencies must work more closely together, and share timely information with our state and local authorities. The more we know, the more terrorist plans we can prevent and disrupt, and the better we'll be able toprotect the American people. And in all they do, our intelligence agencies must attract the best people -- the best collectors, the best analysts, the best linguists. We will give them the training they need and thecompensation they deserve. There have been times here in America when our intelligence services were held in suspicion, and even contempt. Now, when we face this new war, we know how much we needthem. And for their dedication and for their service, America is grateful. We're also grateful to you, the students of the Citadel. Your uniforms symbolize a tradition of honor and sacrifice, renewed in your own lives. Many of you will enter our military -- taking your place in the war against terror. That struggle may continue for many years, and it maybring great costs. But you will have chosen a great calling at a crucial hour for our nation. The course we follow is a matter of profound consequence to many nations. If America wavers, the world will lose heart. If America leads, the world will show its courage. Americawill never waver. America will lead the world to peace. Our cause is necessary. Our cause is just. And no matter how long it takes, we will defeatthe enemies of freedom. In all that is to come, I know the graduates of the Citadel will bring credit to America, to the military, and to this great institution. In the words of your school song, you will go where you've always gone -- ""in the Paths our fathers showed us...Peace and Honor, God andCountry, We will fight for thee."" God bless.",bush
"memory against forgetting. When we fight terror, we fight tyranny; and so we remember. We remember the perfect blueness of the sky that Tuesday morning. We remember the childrentraveling without their mothers when their planes were hijacked. We remember the cruelty of the murderers and the pain and anguish of the murdered. Every one of the innocents who died on September the 11th was the most important person onearth to somebody. Every death extinguished a world. We remember the courage of the rescue workers and the outpouring of friendship and sympathy from nations around the world. We remember how we felt that day: our sadness,the surge of love for our country, our anger, and our determination to right this huge wrong. Today, the wrong is being righted and justice is being done. We still have far to go. And many dangers lie ahead. Yet, there can be no doubt how this conflict will end. Our enemies have made the mistake that America's enemies always make. They saw liberty and thought theysaw weakness. And now, they see defeat. In time, this war will end. But our remembrance never will. All around this beautiful city are statues of our heroes, memorials, museums and archives that preserve our nationalexperience, our achievements and our failures, our defeats and our victories. This republic is young, but its memory is long. Now, we have inscribed a new memory alongside those others. It's a memory of tragedy and shock, of loss and mourning. But not only of loss and mourning. It's also a memory of bravery and self-sacrifice, and the love thatlays down its life for a friend -- even a friend whose name it never knew. We are privileged to have with us the families of many of the heroes on September the 11th, including the family of Jeremy Glick of Flight 93. His courage and self-sacrifice may havesaved the White House. It is right and fitting that it is here we pay our respects. In time, perhaps, we will mark the memory of September the 11th in stone and metal -- something we can show children as yet unborn to help them understand what happened onthis minute and on this day. But for those of us who lived through these events, the only marker we'll ever need is the tick of a clock at the 46th minute of the eighth hour of the 11th day. We will remember where we were and how we felt. We will remember the dead and what we owe them. We will rememberwhat we lost and what we found. And in our time, we will honor the memory of the 11th day by doing our duty as citizens ofthis great country, freedom's home and freedoms defender. God bless.",bush
"Okay! I know you all are anxious to get back to class. So please be seated. Thank you forsuch a warm welcome. It's great to be in the home of the Big Blue -- Hamilton High School. Iwant to thank you all for coming. I particularly want to thank my friend, the Governor of thegreat state of Ohio, Governor Taft, for being here. I want to thank Tracy Miller for being so hospitable. I want to thank all who have come towitness this historic moment. For those of you who have studied the history of ourgovernment, you know most bills are signed at the White House. But I decided to sign thisbill in one of the most important places in America -- a public school. We've got large challenges here in America. There's no greater challenge than to make surethat every child -- and all of us on this stage mean every child, not just a few children -- everysingle child, regardless of where they live, how they're raised, the income level of their family,every child receive a first-class education in America. And as you know, we've got another challenge, and that's to protect America from evilones. And I want to assure the seniors and juniors and sophomores here at Hamilton HighSchool that the effort that this great country is engaged in, the effort to defend freedom andto defend our people, the effort to rout out terror wherever it exists, is noble and just andright, and your great country will prevail in this effort. I long for peace. But I also understand that if we do not lead the world against terror, thatyour children and your grandchildren will not grow up in a society that is as free as the societywe have today. Freedom is the precious gift that one generation can pass to the next. It is agift and a promise that I intend to keep to the American children. And we owe the children of America a good education. And today begins a new era, a newtime in public education in our country. As of this hour, America's schools will be on a newpath of reform, and a new path of results. Our schools will have higher expectations. We believe every child can learn. Our schools willhave greater resources to help meet those goals. Parents will have more information aboutthe schools, and more say in how their children are educated. From this day forward, allstudents will have a better chance to learn, to excel, and to live out their dreams. I want to thank the Secretary of Education, Rod Paige, for being here and for his leadership. Iasked Rod to join my administration because I wanted somebody who understood what itmeant to run a school district in Washington, D.C. I didn't need somebody that based hisknowledge on theory; I wanted somebody who based his knowledge on experience. And Rodwas a teacher, a school board member, and the Superintendent of the Houston IndependentSchool District. He did a fine job there, and he's doing a fine job in Washington. Reaching this moment has not been easy, as you could tell from Chairman Boehner'sdiscussion. But we made it, because of the willingness of four fine leaders to do what wasright for America. We made it because proud members of the House and the Senate, loyal totheir parties, decided to set partisan politics aside and focus on what was right for America. I want to thank George Miller. I call him Big George, Jorge el Grande. As John mentioned,George and I aren't from the same political ideology -- except when I met with George inAustin, I could tell he shares the same passion I share for making sure that every child getseducated. And he, like me and others, realize that a system that simply shuffles childrenthrough the schools is a system that's going to leave people behind. And so we made up ourminds right then and there to do something about it. I appreciate so very much my friend, Judd Gregg, from the state of New Hampshire, beinghere. He was my campaign manager in the New Hampshire primary. I still invited him tocome with me. After here, we're going to New Hampshire. I look forward to singing Judd'spraises because he is a solid, solid United States senator -- honest, full of integrity, and likethe others here, he buckled down to do what was right for the children. And then, of course, there's Senator Edward Kennedy. And the folks at the Crawford CoffeeShop -- would be somewhat shocked when I told them I actually like the fellow. He is afabulous United States senator. When he's against you, it's tough. When he's with you, it is agreat experience. And I'm signing this bill here because it's the home of the Chairman, John Boehner. John dida really good job. He shepherded the process. He made sure people showed up for themeetings. He was dogged in his determination to get this bill done. It would not havehappened without his leadership. And all four of these members up here need to be proud ofthe legacy they have left behind. This is a good bill for the American children, and I'm proudto sign it in their presence. There are other members of the Congress who are here, as well, and I want to thank them forcoming. Senator Evan Bayh from the state of Indiana, is here. Evan, thank you for yourleadership on education reform. Senator Mike DeWine of your state of Ohio, who helpedauthor -- who helped to author the safe and drug-free schools part of this bill. Thank you foryour leadership. Steve Chabot of Ohio, Van Hilleary of Tennessee -- thank you both for coming, as well. Inthat box is the bill. I don't intend to read it all. It's not exactly light reading. But if you wereto read it all, you would find that it contains some very important principles that will helpguide our public school system for the next decades. First principle is accountability. Every school has a job to do. And that's to teach the basicsand teach them well. If we want to make sure no child is left behind, every child must learnto read. And every child must learn to add and subtract. So in return for federal dollars, weare asking states to design accountability systems to show parents and teachers whether ornot children can read and write and add and subtract in grades three through eight. The fundamental principle of this bill is that every child can learn, we expect every child tolearn, and you must show us whether or not every child is learning. I read a quote one timefrom a young lady in New York. She said, ""I don't ever remember taking an exam. They justkept passing me along. I ended up dropping out in the 7th grade. I basically felt nobodycared."" The story of children being just shuffled through the system is one of the saddest stories ofAmerica. Let's just move them through. It's so much easier to move a child through thantrying to figure out how to solve a child's problems. The first step to making sure that a childis not shuffled through is to test that child as to whether or not he or she can read and write,or add and subtract. The first way to solve a problem is to diagnose it. And so, what this bill says, it says everychild can learn. And we want to know early, before it's too late, whether or not a child has aproblem in learning. I understand taking tests aren't fun. Too bad. We need to know inAmerica. We need to know whether or not children have got the basic education. No longer is it acceptable to hide poor performance. No longer is it acceptable to keep resultsaway from parents. One of the interesting things about this bill, it says that we're never goingto give up on a school that's performing poorly; that when we find poor performance, a schoolwill be given time and incentives and resources to correct their problems. A school will begiven time to try other methodologies, perhaps other leadership, to make sure that peoplecan succeed. If, however, schools don't perform, if, however, given the new resources,focused resources, they are unable to solve the problem of not educating their children, theremust be real consequences. There must be a moment in which parents can say, I've hadenough of this school. Parents must be given real options in the face of failure in order tomake sure reform is meaningful. And so, therefore, this bill's second principle is, is that we trust parents to make the rightdecisions for their children. Any school that doesn't perform, any school that cannot catch upand do its job, a parent will have these options -- a better public school, a tutor, or a charterschool. We do not want children trapped in schools that will not change and will not teach. The third principle of this bill is that we have got to trust the local folks on how to achievestandards, to meet the standards. In Washington, there's some smart people there, but thepeople who care most about the children in Hamilton are the citizens of Hamilton. The peoplewho care most about the children in this school are the teachers and parents and school boardmembers. And therefore, schools not only have the responsibility to improve, they now havethe freedom to improve. The federal government will not micromanage how schools are run. We believe strongly -- webelieve strongly the best path to education reform is to trust the local people. And so the newrole of the federal government is to set high standards, provide resources, hold peopleaccountable, and liberate school districts to meet the standards. I can't think of any better way to say to teachers, we trust you. And, first of all, we've got tothank all the teachers who are here. I thank you for teaching. Yours is indeed a nobleprofession. And our society is better off because you decided to teach. And by saying we trustlocal folks, we're really saying we trust you. We trust you. We want you to have as muchflexibility as possible to see to it that every child that walks in your classroom cansucceed. So thank you for what you do. And a fourth principle is that we're going to spend more money, more resources, but they'll bedirected at methods that work. Not feel-good methods, not sound-good methods, butmethods that actually work. Particularly when it comes to reading. We're going to spendmore on our schools, and we're going to spend it more wisely. If we've learned anything over the last generations, money alone doesn't make a goodschool. It certainly helps. But as John mentioned, we've spent billions of dollars with lousyresults. So now it's time to spend billions of dollars and get good results. As John mentioned, too many of our kids can't read. You know, a huge percentage of childrenin poverty can't read at grade level. That's not right in America. We're going to win the waroverseas, and we need to win the war against illiteracy here at home, as well. And so this bill-- so this bill focuses on reading. It sets a grand goal for the country. Our children will bereading by the third grade. That's not an impossible goal. It's a goal we must meet if we want every child tosucceed. And so, therefore, we tripled the amount of federal funding for scientifically-basedearly reading programs. We've got money in there to make sure teachers know how to teachwhat works. We've got money in there to help promote proven methods of instruction. There are no more excuses, as far as I'm concerned, about not teaching children how toread. We know what works. The money is now available, and it's up to each local district tomake sure it happens. It's up to you, the citizens of Hamilton, to make sure no child is leftbehind. And the federal government can spend money and we can help set standards, and wecan assist upon accountability. But the truth of the matter is our schools will flourish whencitizens join in the noble cause of making sure no child is left behind. This is the end of a legislative process. Signing this bill is the end of a long, long time ofpeople sitting in rooms trying to hammer out differences. It's a great symbol of what ispossible in Washington when good people come together to do what's right. But it's just thebeginning of change. And now it's up to you, the local citizens of our great land, thecompassionate, decent citizens of America, to stand up and demand high standards, and todemand that no child -- not one single child in America -- is left behind. Thank you for letting us come. May God bless.",bush
"Thank  you  very  much.   Mr.  Speaker,  Vice  President  Cheney,  members  of  Congress,  distinguished  guests,  fellow  citizens:  As  we   gather  tonight,  our  nation  is  at  war,  our  economy  is  in  recession,  and  the  civilized  world  faces   unprecedented  dangers.  Yet  the  state  of  our  Union  has  never  been  stronger.   We  last  met  in  an  hour  of  shock  and  suffering.   In  four  short  months,  our  nation  has  comforted  the  victims,   begun  to  rebuild  New  York  and  the  Pentagon,  rallied  a  great  coalition,  captured,  arrested,  and  rid  the  world   of  thousands  of  terrorists,  destroyed  Afghanistan's  terrorist  training  camps,  saved  a  people  from  starvation,   and  freed  a  country  from  brutal  oppression.   The  American  flag  flies  again  over  our  embassy  in  Kabul.  Terrorists  who  once  occupied  Afghanistan  now   occupy  cells  at  Guantanamo  Bay.  And  terrorist  leaders  who  urged  followers  to  sacrifice  their  lives  are   running  for  their  own.   America  and  Afghanistan  are  now  allies  against  terror.  We'll  be  partners  in  rebuilding  that  country.  And  this   evening  we  welcome  the  distinguished  interim  leader  of  a  liberated  Afghanistan:  Chairman  Hamid  Karzai.   The  last  time  we  met  in  this  chamber,  the  mothers  and  daughters  of  Afghanistan  were  captives  in  their  own   homes,  forbidden  from  working  or  going  to  school.   Today  women  are  free,  and  are  part  of  Afghanistan's   new  government.   And  we  welcome  the  new  Minister  of  Women's  Affairs,  Doctor  Sima  Samar.   Our  progress  is  a  tribute  to  the  spirit  of  the  Afghan  people,  to  the  resolve  of  our  coalition,  and  to  the  might  of   the  United  States  military. When  I  called  our  troops  into  action,  I  did  so  with  complete  confidence  in  their   courage  and  skill.  And  tonight,  thanks  to  them,  we  are  winning  the  war  on  terror. Page  1      The  man  and  women  of  our  Armed  Forces  have  delivered  a  message  now  clear  to  every  enemy  of  the   United  States:   Even  7,000  miles  away,  across  oceans  and  continents,  on  mountaintops  and  in  caves        you   will  not  escape  the  justice  of  this  nation.   For  many  Americans,  these  four  months  have  brought  sorrow,  and  pain  that  will  never  completely  go  away.   Every  day  a  retired  firefighter  returns  to  Ground  Zero,  to  feel  closer  to  his  two  sons  who  died  there.  At  a   memorial  in  New  York,  a  little  boy  left  his  football  with  a  note  for  his  lost  father:  Dear  Daddy,  please  take  this   to  heaven.  I  don't  want  to  play  football  until  I  can  play  with  you  again  some  day.   Last  month,  at  the  grave  of  her  husband,  Michael,  a  CIA  officer  and  Marine  who  died  in  Mazur  e  Sharif,   Shannon  Spann  said  these  words  of  farewell:  ""Semper  Fi,  my  love.""  Shannon  is  with  us  tonight.   Shannon,  I  assure  you  and  all  who  have  lost  a  loved  one  that  our  cause  is  just,  and  our  country  will  never   forget  the  debt  we  owe  Michael  and  all  who  gave  their  lives  for  freedom.   Our  cause  is  just,  and  it  continues.  Our  discoveries  in  Afghanistan  confirmed  our  worst  fears,  and  showed   us  the  true  scope  of  the  task  ahead.  We  have  seen  the  depth  of  our  enemies'  hatred  in  videos,  where  they   laugh  about  the  loss  of  innocent  life.  And  the  depth  of  their  hatred  is  equaled  by  the  madness  of  the   destruction  they  design.  We  have  found  diagrams  of  American  nuclear  power  plants  and  public  water   facilities,  detailed  instructions  for  making  chemical  weapons,  surveillance  maps  of  American  cities,  and   thorough  descriptions  of  landmarks  in  America  and  throughout  the  world.   What  we  have  found  in  Afghanistan  confirms  that,  far  from  ending  there,  our  war  against  terror  is  only   beginning.  Most  of  the  19  men  who  hijacked  planes  on  September  the  11th  were  trained  in  Afghanistan's   camps,  and  so  were  tens  of  thousands  of  others.  Thousands  of  dangerous  killers,  schooled  in  the  methods   of  murder,  often  supported  by  outlaw  regimes,  are  now  spread  throughout  the  world  like  ticking  time  bombs,   set  to  go  off  without  warning.   Thanks  to  the  work  of  our  law  enforcement  officials  and  coalition  partners,  hundreds  of  terrorists  have  been   arrested.  Yet,  tens  of  thousands  of  trained  terrorists  are  still  at  large.  These  enemies  view  the  entire  world   as  a  battlefield,  and  we  must  pursue  them  wherever  they  are.  So  long  as  training  camps  operate,  so  long  as   nations  harbor  terrorists,  freedom  is  at  risk.  And  America  and  our  allies  must  not,  and  will  not,  allow  it.   Our  nation  will  continue  to  be  steadfast  and  patient  and  persistent  in  the  pursuit  of  two  great  objectives.   First,  we  will  shut  down  terrorist  camps,  disrupt  terrorist  plans,  and  bring  terrorists  to  justice.  And,  second,   we  must  prevent  the  terrorists  and  regimes  who  seek  chemical,  biological  or  nuclear  weapons  from   threatening  the  United  States  and  the  world.   Our  military  has  put  the  terror  training  camps  of  Afghanistan  out  of  business,  yet  camps  still  exist  in  at  least   a  dozen  countries.  A  terrorist  underworld        including  groups  like  Hamas,  Hezbollah,  Islamic  Jihad,  Jaish  i     Mohammed        operates  in  remote  jungles  and  deserts,  and  hides  in  the  centers  of  large  cities.   While  the  most  visible  military  action  is  in  Afghanistan,  America  is  acting  elsewhere.  We  now  have  troops  in   the  Philippines,  helping  to  train  that  country's  armed  forces  to  go  after  terrorist  cells  that  have  executed  an   American,  and  still  hold  hostages. Page  2      Our  soldiers,  working  with  the  Bosnian  government,  seized  terrorists  who  were  plotting  to  bomb  our   embassy.  Our  Navy  is  patrolling  the  coast  of  Africa  to  block  the  shipment  of  weapons  and  the  establishment   of  terrorist  camps  in  Somalia.   My  hope  is  that  all  nations  will  heed  our  call,  and  eliminate  the  terrorist  parasites  who  threaten  their   countries  and  our  own.   Many  nations  are  acting  forcefully.  Pakistan  is  now  cracking  down  on  terror,  and  I   admire  the  strong  leadership  of  President  Musharraf.   But  some  governments  will  be  timid  in  the  face  of  terror.  And  make  no  mistake  about  it:  If  they  do  not  act,   America  will.   Our  second  goal  is  to  prevent  regimes  that  sponsor  terror  from  threatening  America  or  our  friends  and  allies   with  weapons  of  mass  destruction.  Some  of  these  regimes  have  been  pretty  quiet  since  September  the   11th.  But  we  know  their  true  nature.  North  Korea  is  a  regime  arming  with  missiles  and  weapons  of  mass   destruction,  while  starving  its  citizens.   Iran  aggressively  pursues  these  weapons  and  exports  terror,  while  an  unelected  few  repress  the  Iranian   people's  hope  for  freedom.   Iraq  continues  to  flaunt  its  hostility  toward  America  and  to  support  terror.  The  Iraqi  regime  has  plotted  to   develop  anthrax,  and  nerve  gas,  and  nuclear  weapons  for  over  a  decade.  This  is  a  regime  that  has  already   used  poison  gas  to  murder  thousands  of  its  own  citizens        leaving  the  bodies  of  mothers  huddled  over  their   dead  children.  This  is  a  regime  that  agreed  to  international  inspections        then  kicked  out  the  inspectors.   This  is  a  regime  that  has  something  to  hide  from  the  civilized  world.   States  like  these,  and  their  terrorist  allies,  constitute  an  axis  of  evil,  arming  to  threaten  the  peace  of  the   world.  By  seeking  weapons  of  mass  destruction,  these  regimes  pose  a  grave  and  growing  danger.  They   could  provide  these  arms  to  terrorists,  giving  them  the  means  to  match  their  hatred.  They  could  attack  our   allies  or  attempt  to  blackmail  the  United  States.  In  any  of  these  cases,  the  price  of  indifference  would  be   catastrophic.   We  will  work  closely  with  our  coalition  to  deny  terrorists  and  their  state  sponsors  the  materials,  technology,   and  expertise  to  make  and  deliver  weapons  of  mass  destruction.  We  will  develop  and  deploy  effective   missile  defenses  to  protect  America  and  our  allies  from  sudden  attack.  And  all  nations  should   know:  America  will  do  what  is  necessary  to  ensure  our  nation's  security.   We'll  be  deliberate,  yet  time  is  not  on  our  side.  I  will  not  wait  on  events,  while  dangers  gather.   I  will  not   stand  by,  as  peril  draws  closer  and  closer.  The  United  States  of  America  will  not  permit  the  world's  most   dangerous  regimes  to  threaten  us  with  the  world's  most  destructive  weapons.   Our  war  on  terror  is  well  begun,  but  it  is  only  begun.  This  campaign  may  not  be  finished  on  our  watch        yet   it  must  be  and  it  will  be  waged  on  our  watch. Page  3      We  can't  stop  short.  If  we  stop  now        leaving  terror  camps  intact  and  terror  states  unchecked        our  sense  of   security  would  be  false  and  temporary.  History  has  called  America  and  our  allies  to  action,  and  it  is  both  our   responsibility  and  our  privilege  to  fight  freedom's  fight.   Our  first  priority  must  always  be  the  security  of  our  nation,  and  that  will  be  reflected  in  the  budget  I  send  to   Congress.  My  budget  supports  three  great  goals  for  America:  We  will  win  this  war    we'll  protect  our   homeland    and  we  will  revive  our  economy.   September  the  11th  brought  out  the  best  in  America,  and  the  best  in  this  Congress.  And  I  join  the  American   people  in  applauding  your  unity  and  resolve.  Now  Americans  deserve  to  have  this  same  spirit  directed   toward  addressing  problems  here  at  home.  I'm  a  proud  member  of  my  party        yet  as  we  act  to  win  the  war,   protect  our  people,  and  create  jobs  in  America,  we  must  act,  first  and  foremost,  not  as  Republicans,  not  as   Democrats,  but  as  Americans.   It  costs  a  lot  to  fight  this  war.   We  have  spent  more  than  a  billion  dollars  a  month        over  $30  million  a  day         and  we  must  be  prepared  for  future  operations.  Afghanistan  proved  that  expensive  precision  weapons   defeat  the  enemy  and  spare  innocent  lives,  and  we  need  more  of  them.  We  need  to  replace  aging  aircraft   and  make  our  military  more  agile,  to  put  our  troops  anywhere  in  the  world  quickly  and  safely.  Our  men  and   women  in  uniform  deserve  the  best  weapons,  the  best  equipment,  the  best  training        and  they  also  deserve   another  pay  raise.   My  budget  includes  the  largest  increase  in  defense  spending  in  two  decades        because  while  the  price  of   freedom  and  security  is  high,  it  is  never  too  high.  Whatever  it  costs  to  defend  our  country,  we  will  pay.   The  next  priority  of  my  budget  is  to  do  everything  possible  to  protect  our  citizens  and  strengthen  our  nation   against  the  ongoing  threat  of  another  attack.  Time  and  distance  from  the  events  of  September  the  11th  will   not  make  us  safer  unless  we  act  on  its  lessons.  America  is  no  longer  protected  by  vast  oceans.  We  are   protected  from  attack  only  by  vigorous  action  abroad,  and  increased  vigilance  at  home.   My  budget  nearly  doubles  funding  for  a  sustained  strategy  of  homeland  security,  focused  on  four  key  areas:   bioterrorism,  emergency  response,  airport  and  border  security,  and  improved  intelligence.   We  will  develop   vaccines  to  fight  anthrax  and  other  deadly  diseases.  We'll  increase  funding  to  help  states  and  communities   train  and  equip  our  heroic  police  and  firefighters.  We  will  improve  intelligence  collection  and  sharing,  expand   patrols  at  our  borders,  strengthen  the  security  of  air  travel,  and  use  technology  to  track  the  arrivals  and   departures  of  visitors  to  the  United  States.   Homeland  security  will  make  America  not  only  stronger,  but,  in  many  ways,  better.  Knowledge  gained  from   bioterrorism  research  will  improve  public  health.  Stronger  police  and  fire  departments  will  mean  safer   neighborhoods.  Stricter  border  enforcement  will  help  combat  illegal  drugs.  And  as  government  works  to   better  secure  our  homeland,  America  will  continue  to  depend  on  the  eyes  and  ears  of  alert  citizens.   A  few  days  before  Christmas,  an  airline  flight  attendant  spotted  a  passenger  lighting  a  match.  The  crew  and   passengers  quickly  subdued  the  man,  who  had  been  trained  by  al  Qaeda  and  was  armed  with  explosives.   The  people  on  that  plane  were  alert  and,  as  a  result,  likely  saved  nearly  200  lives.   And  tonight  we  welcome   and  thank  flight  attendants  Hermis  Moutardier  and  Christina  Jones. Page  4      Once  we  have  funded  our  national  security  and  our  homeland  security,  the  final  great  priority  of  my  budget   is  economic  security  for  the  American  people.  To  achieve  these  great  national  objectives        to  win  the  war,   protect  the  homeland,  and  revitalize  our  economy        our  budget  will  run  a  deficit  that  will  be  small  and  short     term,  so  long  as  Congress  restrains  spending  and  acts  in  a  fiscally  responsible  manner.  We  have  clear   priorities  and  we  must  act  at  home  with  the  same  purpose  and  resolve  we  have  shown  overseas:  We'll   prevail  in  the  war,  and  we  will  defeat  this  recession.   Americans  who  have  lost  their  jobs  need  our  help  and  I  support  extending  unemployment  benefits  and  direct   assistance  for  health  care  coverage.  Yet,  American  workers  want  more  than  unemployment  checks        they   want  a  steady  paycheck.  When  America  works,  America  prospers,  so  my  economic  security  plan  can  be   summed  up  in  one  word:   jobs.   Good  jobs  begin  with  good  schools,  and  here  we've  made  a  fine  start.  Republicans  and  Democrats  worked   together  to  achieve  historic  education  reform  so  that  no  child  is  left  behind.  I  was  proud  to  work  with   members  of  both  parties:  Chairman  John  Boehner  and  Congressman  George  Miller.  Senator  Judd  Gregg.   And  I  was  so  proud  of  our  work,  I  even  had  nice  things  to  say  about  my  friend,  Ted  Kennedy.  I  know  the   folks  at  the  Crawford  coffee  shop  couldn't  believe  I'd  say  such  a  thing        but  our  work  on  this  bill  shows  what   is  possible  if  we  set  aside  posturing  and  focus  on  results.   There  is  more  to  do.  We  need  to  prepare  our  children  to  read  and  succeed  in  school  with  improved  Head   Start  and  early  childhood  development  programs.  We  must  upgrade  our  teacher  colleges  and  teacher   training  and  launch  a  major  recruiting  drive  with  a  great  goal  for  America:  a  quality  teacher  in  every   classroom.   Good  jobs  also  depend  on  reliable  and  affordable  energy.  This  Congress  must  act  to  encourage   conservation,  promote  technology,  build  infrastructure,  and  it  must  act  to  increase  energy  production  at   home  so  America  is  less  dependent  on  foreign  oil.   Good  jobs  depend  on  expanded  trade.  Selling  into  new  markets  creates  new  jobs,  so  I  ask  Congress  to   finally  approve  trade  promotion  authority.  On  these  two  key  issues,  trade  and  energy,  the  House  of   Representatives  has  acted  to  create  jobs,  and  I  urge  the  Senate  to  pass  this  legislation.   Good  jobs  depend  on  sound  tax  policy.  Last  year,  some  in  this  hall  thought  my  tax  relief  plan  was  too  small     some  thought  it  was  too  big.  But  when  the  checks  arrived  in  the  mail,  most  Americans  thought  tax  relief  was   just  about  right.  Congress  listened  to  the  people  and  responded  by  reducing  tax  rates,  doubling  the  child   credit,  and  ending  the  death  tax.   For  the  sake  of  long  term  growth  and  to  help  Americans  plan  for  the   future,  let's  make  these  tax  cuts  permanent.   The  way  out  of  this  recession,  the  way  to  create  jobs,  is  to  grow  the  economy  by  encouraging  investment  in   factories  and  equipment,  and  by  speeding  up  tax  relief  so  people  have  more  money  to  spend.  For  the  sake   of  American  workers,  let's  pass  a  stimulus  package.   Good  jobs must  be  the  aim  of  welfare  reform. Page  5      As  we  reauthorize  these  important  reforms,  we  must  always  remember  the  goal  is  to  reduce  dependency  on   government  and  offer  every  American  the  dignity  of  a  job.   Americans  know  economic  security  can  vanish  in  an  instant  without  health  security.  I  ask  Congress  to  join   me  this  year  to  enact  a  patients'  bill  of  rights        to  give  uninsured  workers  credits  to  help  buy  health  coverage         to  approve  an  historic  increase  in  the  spending  for  veterans'  health        and  to  give  seniors  a  sound  and   modern  Medicare  system  that  includes  coverage  for  prescription  drugs.   A  good  job  should  lead  to  security  in  retirement.  I  ask  Congress  to  enact  new  safeguards  for  401K  and   pension  plans.  Employees  who  have  worked  hard  and  saved  all  their  lives  should  not  have  to  risk  losing   everything  if  their  company  fails.  Through  stricter  accounting  standards  and  tougher  disclosure   requirements,  corporate  America  must  be  made  more  accountable  to  employees  and  shareholders  and  held   to  the  highest  standards  of  conduct.   Retirement  security  also  depends  upon  keeping  the  commitments  of  Social  Security,  and  we  will.   We  must   make  Social  Security  financially  stable  and  allow  personal  retirement  accounts  for  younger  workers  who   choose  them.   Members,  you  and  I  will  work  together  in  the  months  ahead  on  other  issues:   productive  farm  policy        a   cleaner  environment        broader  home  ownership,  especially  among  minorities        and  ways  to  encourage  the   good  work  of  charities  and  faith  based  groups.  I  ask  you  to  join  me  on  these  important  domestic  issues  in   the  same  spirit  of  cooperation  we've  applied  to  our  war  against  terrorism.   During  these  last  few  months,  I've  been  humbled  and  privileged  to  see  the  true  character  of  this  country  in  a   time  of  testing.  Our  enemies  believed  America  was  weak  and  materialistic,  that  we  would  splinter  in  fear  and   selfishness.  They  were  as  wrong  as  they  are  evil.   The  American  people  have  responded  magnificently,  with  courage  and  compassion,  strength  and  resolve.   As  I  have  met  the  heroes,  hugged  the  families,  and  looked  into  the  tired  faces  of  rescuers,  I  have  stood  in   awe  of  the  American  people.   And  I  hope  you  will  join  me        I  hope  you  will  join  me  in  expressing  thanks  to  one  American  for  the  strength   and  calm  and  comfort  she  brings  to  our  nation  in  crisis,  our  First  Lady,  Laura  Bush.   None  of  us  would  ever  wish  the  evil  that  was  done  on  September  the  11th.  Yet  after  America  was  attacked,   it  was  as  if  our  entire  country  looked  into  a  mirror  and  saw  our  better  selves.  We  were  reminded  that  we  are   citizens,  with  obligations  to  each  other,  to  our  country,  and  to  history.  We  began  to  think  less  of  the  goods   we  can  accumulate,  and  more  about  the  good  we  can  do.   For  too  long  our  culture  has  said,  ""If  it  feels  good,  do  it.""  Now  America  is  embracing  a  new  ethic  and  a  new   creed:  ""Let's  roll.""  In  the  sacrifice  of  soldiers,  the  fierce  brotherhood  of  firefighters,  and  the  bravery  and   generosity  of  ordinary  citizens,  we  have  glimpsed  what  a  new  culture  of  responsibility  could  look  like.  We   want  to  be  a  nation  that  serves  goals  larger  than  self.   We've  been  offered  a  unique  opportunity,  and  we   must  not  let  this  moment  pass. Page  6      My  call  tonight  is  for  every  American  to  commit  at  least  two  years        4,000  hours  over  the  rest  of  your  lifetime         to  the  service  of  your  neighbors  and  your  nation.  Many  are  already  serving,  and  I  thank  you.   If  you  aren't   sure  how  to  help,  I've  got  a  good  place  to  start.  To  sustain  and  extend  the  best  that  has  emerged  in   America,  I  invite  you  to  join  the  new  USA  Freedom  Corps.  The  Freedom  Corps  will  focus  on  three  areas  of   need:  responding  in  case  of  crisis  at  home    rebuilding  our  communities    and  extending  American   compassion  throughout  the  world.   One  purpose  of  the  USA  Freedom  Corps  will  be  homeland  security.  America  needs  retired  doctors  and   nurses  who  can  be  mobilized  in  major  emergencies    volunteers  to  help  police  and  fire  departments     transportation  and  utility  workers  well  trained  in  spotting  danger.   Our  country  also  needs  citizens  working  to  rebuild  our  communities.  We  need  mentors  to  love  children,   especially  children  whose  parents  are  in  prison.   And  we  need  more  talented  teachers  in  troubled  schools.   USA  Freedom  Corps  will  expand  and  improve  the  good  efforts  of  AmeriCorps  and  Senior  Corps  to  recruit   more  than  200,000  new  volunteers.   And  America  needs  citizens  to  extend  the  compassion  of  our  country  to  every  part  of  the  world.   So  we  will   renew  the  promise  of  the  Peace  Corps,  double  its  volunteers  over  the  next  five  years        (applause)        and   ask  it  to  join  a  new  effort  to  encourage  development  and  education  and  opportunity  in  the  Islamic  world.   This  time  of  adversity  offers  a  unique  moment  of  opportunity        a  moment  we  must  seize  to  change  our   culture.   Through  the  gathering  momentum  of  millions  of  acts  of  service  and  decency  and  kindness,  I  know   we  can  overcome  evil  with  greater  good.  And  we  have  a  great  opportunity  during  this  time  of  war  to  lead  the   world  toward  the  values  that  will  bring  lasting  peace.   All  fathers  and  mothers,  in  all  societies,  want  their  children  to  be  educated,  and  live  free  from  poverty  and   violence.  No  people  on  Earth  yearn  to  be  oppressed,  or  aspire  to  servitude,  or  eagerly  await  the  midnight   knock  of  the  secret  police.   If  anyone  doubts  this,  let  them  look  to  Afghanistan,  where  the  Islamic  ""street""  greeted  the  fall  of  tyranny  with   song  and  celebration.  Let  the  skeptics  look  to  Islam's  own  rich  history,  with  its  centuries  of  learning,  and   tolerance  and  progress.  America  will  lead  by  defending  liberty  and  justice  because  they  are  right  and  true   and  unchanging  for  all  people  everywhere.   No  nation  owns  these  aspirations,  and  no  nation  is  exempt  from  them.  We  have  no  intention  of  imposing  our   culture.  But  America  will  always  stand  firm  for  the  non  negotiable  demands  of  human  dignity:   the  rule  of   law    limits  on  the  power  of  the  state    respect  for  women    private  property    free  speech    equal  justice    and   religious  tolerance.   America  will  take  the  side  of  brave  men  and  women  who  advocate  these  values  around  the  world,  including   the  Islamic  world,  because  we  have  a  greater  objective  than  eliminating  threats  and  containing  resentment.   We  seek  a  just  and  peaceful  world  beyond  the  war  on  terror.   In  this  moment  of  opportunity,  a  common  danger  is  erasing  old  rivalries.  America  is  working  with  Russia  and   China  and  India,  in  ways  we  have  never  before,  to  achieve  peace  and  prosperity. Page  7      In  every  region,  free  markets  and  free  trade  and  free  societies  are  proving  their  power  to  lift  lives.   Together   with  friends  and  allies  from  Europe  to  Asia,  and  Africa  to  Latin  America,  we  will  demonstrate  that  the  forces   of  terror  cannot  stop  the  momentum  of  freedom.   The  last  time  I  spoke  here,  I  expressed  the  hope  that  life  would  return  to  normal.  In  some  ways,  it  has.  In   others,  it  never  will.   Those  of  us  who  have  lived  through  these  challenging  times  have  been  changed  by   them.  We've  come  to  know  truths  that  we  will  never  question:  evil  is  real,  and  it  must  be  opposed.  Beyond   all  differences  of  race  or  creed,  we  are  one  country,  mourning  together  and  facing  danger  together.  Deep  in   the  American  character,  there  is  honor,  and  it  is  stronger  than  cynicism.   And  many  have  discovered  again   that  even  in  tragedy        especially  in  tragedy        God  is  near.   In  a  single  instant,  we  realized  that  this  will  be  a  decisive  decade  in  the  history  of  liberty,  that  we've  been   called  to  a  unique  role  in  human  events.  Rarely  has  the  world  faced  a  choice  more  clear  or  consequential.   Our  enemies  send  other  people's  children  on  missions  of  suicide  and  murder.  They  embrace  tyranny  and   death  as  a  cause  and  a  creed.  We  stand  for  a  different  choice,  made  long  ago,  on  the  day  of  our   founding. We  affirm  it  again  today. We  choose  freedom  and  the  dignity  of  every  life.   Steadfast  in  our  purpose,  we  now  press  on.  We  have  known  freedom's  price.  We  have  shown  freedom's   power.  And  in  this  great  conflict,  my  fellow  Americans,  we  will  see  freedom's  victory.   Thank  you  all.  May  God  bless. Page  8  ",bush
"Well, thank you very much for that warm welcome. I am so grateful for the Commonwealth Club and the Churchill Club for inviting me here. I appreciate you all coming, and I appreciateyour hospitality. I want to thank Dr. Gloria Duffy for her generous introduction and for her invitation. I want to thank Silvia Fernandez, who's the President of the Churchill Club, for joining the Commonwealth Club to host this event. I want to thank all the elected officials who are here. Iwant to thank my fellow citizens for coming. Whenever I visit California, I'm impressed by the beauty of this state and by the spirit of the people. Because of its size, the health of the California economy influences every American. And California has got a culture of optimism and energy that touches all of us, as well. This isa vital and a vibrant place. And I'm glad to be back. The last time I visited San Jose, Silicon Valley was still in an economic boom, and America was at peace. For many in this valley, and across our country, those times are a world away. After a recession made worse by a national emergency, we have seen some good news. Our economy is beginning to grow. Just last week, we had the good news about strong growth inthe first quarter. Yet this vital region reminds us that a lot of work remains to be done. Business investment and job creation are not what they should be. We cannot be content with one quarter's news. We cannot be complacent. My attitude is that we'll let the statisticians talk about the numbers. But so long as somebody who wants to work can't find work, that's aproblem for America. We have a great task ahead of us. We must turn our short-term recovery into long-lasting expansion that reaches every part of our country. Our economy grows when trade barriers fall. I ask the Senate to join the United States House of Representatives in giving me what'scalled trade promotion authority. It's important to be a confident country. And I'm confident in the ability of American entrepreneurs and producers to compete in the world. I'm confident that our farmers and ranchers can compete in the world. And I know American technology companies are the bestin the world. And we must open new markets so they can sell to the world. Our economy grows when the tax burden goes down, and stays down. Much of the growth we have seen this quarter is the result of consumer spending, fueled by well-timed tax deductions. (Laughter.) To encourage growth in job creation, we must protect the lower tax rates we've enacted, and we must make them permanent. And to make sure there is economic vitality around our country, our government must control its appetite for excessivespending. Our economy grows entrepreneurs are rewarded for their success, not hounded by regulations and needless litigation. We must enact reforms that free entrepreneurs from pointless regulation and endless litigation, and to restore trust in our economy. Corporate leaders must be held to the highest ethical standards. And, as your state knows, our economy grows whenwe have steady, stable and affordable sources of energy. In Washington, we must adopt -- finally adopt -- a comprehensive strategy to conserve more, to produce more, and to deliver the energy that keeps our economy running. Both Houses have passed an energy -- passed energy legislation. I expect them to get a bill to my desk soon for the good of American economy and American jobs. By acting in the above way, we confirm that the role of government is not to create wealth; the role of government is tocreate the conditions for economic growth. Since I was last here, America has also accepted a great challenge in the world: to wage a relentless and systematic campaign against global terror. The security of the American people is the central commitment of the American government. We are in for a long and difficult war.It will be conducted on many fronts. But as long as it takes, we will prevail. In the first phase of our military operation, American and coalition forces have liberated -- have liberated -- the people of Afghanistan from a barbaric regime. Our Armed Forces performed with skill and success and honor. A regime has fallen. Terrorists in that country are now scattered, and the children of Afghanistan have returned to school, boys and girls. Our work in that country is not over. We are helping the Afghan people to rebuild their nation. And in every cave, in every dark corner of that country, we will hunt down the killers and bringthem to justice. We have entered the next phase of the war, with a sustained international effort, to rout out terrorists in other countries, and deny al Qaeda the chance to regroup in other places. Across the world, governments have heard this message: You're either with us, or you're with theterrorists. And for the long-term security of America and civilization itself, we must confront the great threat of biological and chemical and nuclear weapons in the hands of terrorists or hostile regimes. We will not allow the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten America or ourfriends and allies with the world's most destructive weapons. History has called us to these responsibilities, and we accept them. America has always had a special mission to defend justice and advance freedom around the world. Whatever the difficulties ahead, we are confident about the outcome of this struggle. Tyranny and terror and lawless violence will not decide the world's future. As Ronald Reagan said. and as everygeneration of Americans has believed, the future belongs to the free. In a time of war, we reassert the essential values and beliefs of our country. In the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln pointed toward a new birth of freedom. Leading America into global war, Franklin D. Roosevelt defined the four freedoms: freedom of speech and religion, freedom from fear and want. Whenever America fights for the security of our country, we also fight for the values of our country. In our time, we will defend the land we love and we will act on theideals that gave it birth. In America, we've not always lived up to our ideals, yet we always reached for them. We believe that everyone deserves a chance, that everyone has value, that no insignificant person was ever born. We believe that all are diminished when any are hopeless. We are one people,committed to building a single nation of justice and opportunity. America rejects bigotry. We reject every act of hatred against people of Arab background or Muslim faith. We reject the ancient evil of anti-Semitism, whether it is practiced by the killersof Daniel Pearl, or by those who burn synagogues in France. America values and welcomes peaceful people of all faiths -- Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Sikh, Hindu and many others. Every faith is practiced and protected here, because we are one country. Every immigrant can be fully and equally American because we're one country. Raceand color should not divide us, because America is one country. These American ideals of opportunity and equality come to us across the generations. And they have attracted millions from across the world. Yet there are young Americans growing up here, under this flag, who doubt the promise and justice of our country. They live in neighborhoods occupied by gangs and ruled by fear. They are entitled by law to an education, yet do not receive an education. They hear talk of opportunity and see little evidence ofopportunity around them. Every American must believe in the promise of America. And to reach this noble, necessary goal, there is a role for government. America doesn't need more big government, and we've learned that more money is not always the answer. If a program is failing to serve people, it makes little difference if we spend twice as much or half as much. The measure of truecompassion is results. Yet we cannot have an indifferent government either. We are a generous and caring people. We don't believe in a sink-or-swim society. The policies of our government must heed the universal call of all faiths to love a neighbor as we would want to be loved ourselves. We need a different approach than either big government or indifferent government. We need a government that is focused, effective, and close to the people; a government that does a fewthings, and does them well. Government cannot solve every problem, but it can encourage people and communities to help themselves and to help one another. Often the truest kind of compassion is to help citizens build lives of their own. I call my philosophy and approach ""compassionate conservatism."" It is compassionate to actively help our fellow citizens in need. It is conservative to insist on responsibility and on results. And with this hopeful approach, we canmake a real difference in people's lives. Compassionate conservatism places great hope and confidence in public education. Our economy depends on higher and higher skills, requiring every American to have the basictools of learning. Every public school should be the path of upward mobility. Yet, sadly enough, many are the dead-end of dreams. Public schools are some of the most important institutions of democracy. They take children of every background, from every part of the world, and prepare them for the obligations and opportunities of a free society. Public schools are Americans great hope, and making them work for every child is America's greatduty. The new education reforms we have passed in Washington give the federal government a new role in public education. Schools must meet new and high standards of performance in reading and math that will be proven on tests and posted on the Internet for parents and everyone to see. And we're giving local schools and teachers unprecedented freedom and resources andtraining to meet these goals. It is conservative to let local communities chart their own path to excellence. It is compassionate to insist that every child learns, so that no child is left behind. By insisting on results, and challenging failure where we find it, we'll make an incredible difference in thelives of every child in America. Compassionate conservatism offers a new vision for fighting poverty in America. For decades, our nation has devoted enormous resources to helping the poor, with some great successes to show for it: basic medical care for those in need, a better life for elderly Americans. However,for millions of younger Americans, welfare became a static and destructive way of life. In 1996, we began transforming welfare with time limits and job training and work requirements. And the nation's welfare rolls have been cut by more than half. But even moreimportantly, many lives have been dramatically improved. One former welfare recipient here in California, happened to be a mother of a chronically-ill child and the victim of domestic violence, describes her experience upon leaving welfare. Shesaid, ""I feel like an adult again. I have my dignity back."" We need to continue to fully transform welfare in America. As Congress takes up welfare reform again in the coming weeks, we must strengthen the work requirements that prevent dependency and despair. Millions of Americans once on welfare are finding that a job is more than a source of income. It is a source of dignity. And by helping people find work, by helpingthem prepare for work, we practice compassion. Welfare reform must also, wherever possible, encourage the commitments of family. Not every child has two devoted parents at home -- I understand that. And not every marriagecan, or should be saved. But the evidence shows that strong marriages are good for children. When a couple on welfare wants to break bad patterns and start or strengthen a marriage, we should help local groups give them counseling that teaches commitment and respect. Byencouraging family, we practice compassion. In overcoming poverty and dependence, we must also promote the work of charities and community groups and faith-based institutions. These organizations, such as shelters for battered women or mentoring programs for fatherless children or drug treatment centers, inspire hope in a way that government never can. Often, they inspire life-changing faith in away that government never should. Our government should view the good Americans that work in faith-based charities as partners, not rivals. We must provide new incentives for charitable giving and, when it comes to providing federal resources to effective programs, we should not discriminate againstprivate and religious groups. I urge the Senate to pass the faith-based initiative for the good of America. It is compassionate to aggressively fight poverty in America. It is conservative to encourage work and community spirit and responsibility and the values that often come from faith. And with this approach, we can change lives one soul at a time, and make a real difference in the livesof our citizens. The same principles of compassion and responsibility apply when America offers assistance to other nations. Nearly half of the world's people still live on less than $2 a day. When we help them, we show our values, our belief in universal human dignity. We serve our interests and gain economic partners. And by helping the developing nations of the world, we offer analternative to resentment and conflict and terror. Yet the old way of pouring vast amounts of money into development aid without any concern for results has failed, often leaving behind misery and poverty and corruption. America's offering a new compact for global development. Greater aid contributions from America mustbe and will be linked to greater responsibility from developing nations. I have proposed a 50-percent increase in our core development assistance over the next three budget years. Money that will be placed in a new Millennium Challenge Account. At the end of this three-year period, the level of our annual development assistance will be $5 billion higherthan current levels. This is a record amount of spending. And in return for these funds, we expect nations to rout out corruption, to open their markets, to respect human rights, and to adhere to the rule of law. And these are the keys to progress in any nation, and they will be the conditions for anynew American aid. It is compassionate to increase our international aid. It is conservative to require the hard reforms that lead to prosperity and independence. And with this approach, we'll make a realdifference in the lives of people around the world. Compassionate conservatism guides my administration in many other areas. Our health care policies must help low-income Americans to buy health insurance they choose, they own and they control. Our environmental policy set high standards for stewardship, while allowing local cooperation and innovation to meet those standards. Our housing programs moved beyond rental assistance to the pride and stability of home ownership. Our reforms in Social Security must allow and encourage and help working Americans to build up their own asset base andachieve independence for their retirement years. All of these policies and all of these areas serve the same vision. We are using an active government to promote self-government. We're encouraging individuals and communities and families to take more and more responsibility for themselves, for their neighbors, for our nation. The aim of these policies is not to spend more money or spend less money; it is tospend on what works. The measure of compassion is more than good intentions, it is good results. Sympathy is not enough. We need solutions in America, and we know where solutions are found. When schools are teaching, when families are strong, when neighbors look after their neighbors, when our people have the tools and the skills and the resources they need to improve their lives, thereis no problem that cannot be solved in America. By being involved and by taking responsibility upon ourselves, we gain something else, as well: We contribute to the life of our country. We become more than taxpayers and occasional voters, we become citizens. Citizens, not spectators. Citizens who hear the call of duty, who stand up for their beliefs, who care for their families, who control their lives, and who treat their neighbors with respect and compassion. We discover a satisfaction that is only found inservice, and we show our gratitude to America and to those who came before us. In the last seven months, we've been tested, and the struggle of our time has revealed the spirit of our people. Since September the 11th, we have been the kind of nation our founders had in mind, a nation of strong and confident and self-governing people. And we've been the kind of nation our fathers and mothers defended in World War II; a great and diverse country,united by common dangers and by common resolve. We in our time will defend our nation, and we will deliver our nation's promise to all who seek it. In our war on terror, we are showing the world the strength of our country, and by ourunity and tolerance and compassion, we will show the world the soul of our country. May God bless America.",bush
"For  too  long,  the  citizens  of  the  Middle  East  have  lived  in  the  midst  of  death  and  fear.  The  hatred  of  a  few   holds  the  hopes  of  many  hostage.  The  forces  of  extremism  and  terror  are  attempting  to  kill  progress  and   peace  by  killing  the  innocent.  And  this  casts  a  dark  shadow  over  an  entire  region.  For  the  sake  of  all   humanity,  things  must  change  in  the  Middle  East.   It  is  untenable  for  Israeli  citizens  to  live  in  terror.  It  is  untenable  for  Palestinians  to  live  in  squalor  and   occupation.  And  the  current  situation  offers  no  prospect  that  life  will  improve.  Israeli  citizens  will  continue  to   be  victimized  by  terrorists,  and  so  Israel  will  continue  to  defend  herself.   In  the  situation  the  Palestinian  people  will  grow  more  and  more  miserable.  My  vision  is  two  states,  living  side   by  side  in  peace  and  security.  There  is  simply  no  way  to  achieve  that  peace  until  all  parties  fight  terror.  Yet,   at  this  critical  moment,  if  all  parties  will  break  with  the  past  and  set  out  on  a  new  path,  we  can  overcome  the   darkness  with  the  light  of  hope.  Peace  requires  a  new  and  different  Palestinian  leadership,  so  that  a   Palestinian  state  can  be  born.   I  call  on  the  Palestinian  people  to  elect  new  leaders,  leaders  not  compromised  by  terror.  I  call  upon  them  to   build  a  practicing  democracy,  based  on  tolerance  and  liberty.  If  the  Palestinian  people  actively  pursue  these   goals,  America  and  the  world  will  actively  support  their  efforts.  If  the  Palestinian  people  meet  these  goals,   they  will  be  able  to  reach  agreement  with  Israel  and  Egypt  and  Jordan  on  security  and  other  arrangements   for  independence.   And  when  the  Palestinian  people  have  new  leaders,  new  institutions  and  new  security  arrangements  with   their  neighbors,  the  United  States  of  America  will  support  the  creation  of  a  Palestinian  state  whose  borders   and  certain  aspects  of  its  sovereignty  will  be  provisional  until  resolved  as  part  of  a  final  settlement  in  the   Middle  East.    In  the  work  ahead,  we  all  have  responsibilities.  The  Palestinian  people  are  gifted  and  capable,  and  I  am   confident  they  can  achieve  a  new  birth  for  their  nation.  A  Palestinian  state  will  never  be  created  by  terror        it   will  be  built  through  reform.  And  reform  must  be  more  than  cosmetic  change,  or  veiled  attempt  to  preserve   the  status  quo.  True  reform  will  require  entirely  new  political  and  economic  institutions,  based  on   democracy,  market  economics  and  action  against  terrorism.   Today,  the  elected  Palestinian  legislature  has  no  authority,  and  power  is  concentrated  in  the  hands  of  an   unaccountable  few.  A  Palestinian  state  can  only  serve  its  citizens  with  a  new  constitution  which  separates   the  powers  of  government.  The  Palestinian  parliament  should  have  the  full  authority  of  a  legislative  body.   Local  officials  and  government  ministers  need  authority  of  their  own  and  the  independence  to  govern   effectively.   The  United  States,  along  with  the  European  Union  and  Arab  states,  will  work  with  Palestinian  leaders  to   create  a  new  constitutional  framework,  and  a  working  democracy  for  the  Palestinian  people.  And  the  United   States,  along  with  others  in  the  international  community  will  help  the  Palestinians  organize  and  monitor  fair,   multi  party  local  elections  by  the  end  of  the  year,  with  national  elections  to  follow.   Today,  the  Palestinian  people  live  in  economic  stagnation,  made  worse  by  official  corruption.  A  Palestinian   state  will  require  a  vibrant  economy,  where  honest  enterprise  is  encouraged  by  honest  government.  The   United  States,  the  international  donor  community  and  the  World  Bank  stand  ready  to  work  with  Palestinians   on  a  major  project  of  economic  reform  and  development.  The  United  States,  the  EU,  the  World  Bank,  the   International  Monetary  Fund  are  willing  to  oversee  reforms  in  Palestinian  finances,  encouraging   transparency  and  independent  auditing.   And  the  United  States,  along  with  our  partners  in  the  developed  world,  will  increase  our  humanitarian   assistance  to  relieve  Palestinian  suffering.  Today,  the  Palestinian  people  lack  effective  courts  of  law  and   have  no  means  to  defend  and  vindicate  their  rights.  A  Palestinian  state  will  require  a  system  of  reliable   justice  to  punish  those  who  prey  on  the  innocent.  The  United  States  and  members  of  the  international   community  stand  ready  to  work  with  Palestinian  leaders  to  establish  finance        establish  finance  and  monitor   a  truly  independent  judiciary.   Today,  Palestinian  authorities  are  encouraging,  not  opposing,  terrorism.  This  is  unacceptable.  And  the   United  States  will  not  support  the  establishment  of  a  Palestinian  state  until  its  leaders  engage  in  a  sustained   fight  against  the  terrorists  and  dismantle  their  infrastructure.  This  will  require  an  externally  supervised  effort   to  rebuild  and  reform  the  Palestinian  security  services.  The  security  system  must  have  clear  lines  of   authority  and  accountability  and  a  unified  chain  of  command.   America  is  pursuing  this  reform  along  with  key  regional  states.  The  world  is  prepared  to  help,  yet  ultimately   these  steps  toward  statehood  depend  on  the  Palestinian  people  and  their  leaders.  If  they  energetically  take   the  path  of  reform,  the  rewards  can  come  quickly.  If  Palestinians  embrace  democracy,  confront  corruption   and  firmly  reject  terror,  they  can  count  on  American  support  for  the  creation  of  a  provisional  state  of   Palestine.    With  a  dedicated  effort,  this  state  could  rise  rapidly,  as  it  comes  to  terms  with  Israel,  Egypt  and  Jordan  on   practical  issues,  such  as  security.  The  final  borders,  the  capital  and  other  aspects  of  this  state's  sovereignty   will  be  negotiated  between  the  parties,  as  part  of  a  final  settlement.  Arab  states  have  offered  their  help  in   this  process,  and  their  help  is  needed.   I've  said  in  the  past  that  nations  are  either  with  us  or  against  us  in  the  war  on  terror.  To  be  counted  on  the   side  of  peace,  nations  must  act.  Every  leader  actually  committed  to  peace  will  end  incitement  to  violence  in   official  media,  and  publicly  denounce  homicide  bombings.  Every  nation  actually  committed  to  peace  will  stop   the  flow  of  money,  equipment  and  recruits  to  terrorist  groups  seeking  the  destruction  of  Israel        including   Hamas,  Islamic  Jihad,  and  Hezbollah.  Every  nation  actually  committed  to  peace  must  block  the  shipment  of   Iranian  supplies  to  these  groups,  and  oppose  regimes  that  promote  terror,  like  Iraq.  And  Syria  must  choose   the  right  side  in  the  war  on  terror  by  closing  terrorist  camps  and  expelling  terrorist  organizations.   Leaders  who  want  to  be  included  in  the  peace  process  must  show  by  their  deeds  an  undivided  support  for   peace.  And  as  we  move  toward  a  peaceful  solution,  Arab  states  will  be  expected  to  build  closer  ties  of   diplomacy  and  commerce  with  Israel,  leading  to  full  normalization  of  relations  between  Israel  and  the  entire   Arab  world.   Israel  also  has  a  large  stake  in  the  success  of  a  democratic  Palestine.  Permanent  occupation  threatens   Israel's  identity  and  democracy.  A  stable,  peaceful  Palestinian  state  is  necessary  to  achieve  the  security  that   Israel  longs  for.  So  I  challenge  Israel  to  take  concrete  steps  to  support  the  emergence  of  a  viable,  credible   Palestinian  state.   As  we  make  progress  towards  security,  Israel  forces  need  to  withdraw  fully  to  positions  they  held  prior  to   September  28,  2000.  And  consistent  with  the  recommendations  of  the  Mitchell  Committee,  Israeli  settlement   activity  in  the  occupied  territories  must  stop.   The  Palestinian  economy  must  be  allowed  to  develop.  As  violence  subsides,  freedom  of  movement  should   be  restored,  permitting  innocent  Palestinians  to  resume  work  and  normal  life.  Palestinian  legislators  and   officials,  humanitarian  and  international  workers,  must  be  allowed  to  go  about  the  business  of  building  a   better  future.  And  Israel  should  release  frozen  Palestinian  revenues  into  honest,  accountable  hands.   I've  asked  Secretary  Powell  to  work  intensively  with  Middle  Eastern  and  international  leaders  to  realize  the   vision  of  a  Palestinian  state,  focusing  them  on  a  comprehensive  plan  to  support  Palestinian  reform  and   institution  building.   Ultimately,  Israelis  and  Palestinians  must  address  the  core  issues  that  divide  them  if  there  is  to  be  a  real   peace,  resolving  all  claims  and  ending  the  conflict  between  them.  This  means  that  the  Israeli  occupation  that   began  in  1967  will  be  ended  through  a  settlement  negotiated  between  the  parties,  based  on  U.N.   Resolutions  242  and  338,  with  Israeli  withdrawal  to  secure  and  recognize  borders.   We  must  also  resolve  questions  concerning  Jerusalem,  the  plight  and  future  of  Palestinian  refugees,  and  a   final  peace  between  Israel  and  Lebanon,  and  Israel  and  a  Syria  that  supports  peace  and  fights  terror.    All  who  are  familiar  with  the  history  of  the  Middle  East  realize  that  there  may  be  setbacks  in  this  process.   Trained  and  determined  killers,  as  we  have  seen,  want  to  stop  it.  Yet  the  Egyptian  and  Jordanian  peace   treaties  with  Israel  remind  us  that  with  determined  and  responsible  leadership  progress  can  come  quickly.   As  new  Palestinian  institutions  and  new  leaders  emerge,  demonstrating  real  performance  on  security  and   reform,  I  expect  Israel  to  respond  and  work  toward  a  final  status  agreement.  With  intensive  effort  by  all,  this   agreement  could  be  reached  within  three  years  from  now.  And  I  and  my  country  will  actively  lead  toward   that  goal.   I  can  understand  the  deep  anger  and  anguish  of  the  Israeli  people.  You've  lived  too  long  with  fear  and   funerals,  having  to  avoid  markets  and  public  transportation,  and  forced  to  put  armed  guards  in  kindergarten   classrooms.  The  Palestinian  Authority  has  rejected  your  offer  at  hand,  and  trafficked  with  terrorists.  You   have  a  right  to  a  normal  life    you  have  a  right  to  security    and  I  deeply  believe  that  you  need  a  reformed,   responsible  Palestinian  partner  to  achieve  that  security.   I  can  understand  the  deep  anger  and  despair  of  the  Palestinian  people.  For  decades  you've  been  treated  as   pawns  in  the  Middle  East  conflict.  Your  interests  have  been  held  hostage  to  a  comprehensive  peace   agreement  that  never  seems  to  come,  as  your  lives  get  worse  year  by  year.  You  deserve  democracy  and   the  rule  of  law.  You  deserve  an  open  society  and  a  thriving  economy.  You  deserve  a  life  of  hope  for  your   children.  An  end  to  occupation  and  a  peaceful  democratic  Palestinian  state  may  seem  distant,  but  America   and  our  partners  throughout  the  world  stand  ready  to  help,  help  you  make  them  possible  as  soon  as   possible.   If  liberty  can  blossom  in  the  rocky  soil  of  the  West  Bank  and  Gaza,  it  will  inspire  millions  of  men  and  women   around  the  globe  who  are  equally  weary  of  poverty  and  oppression,  equally  entitled  to  the  benefits  of   democratic  government.   I  have  a  hope  for  the  people  of  Muslim  countries.  Your  commitments  to  morality,  and  learning,  and  tolerance   led  to  great  historical  achievements.  And  those  values  are  alive  in  the  Islamic  world  today.  You  have  a  rich   culture,  and  you  share  the  aspirations  of  men  and  women  in  every  culture.  Prosperity  and  freedom  and   dignity  are  not  just  American  hopes,  or  Western  hopes.  They  are  universal,  human  hopes.  And  even  in  the   violence  and  turmoil  of  the  Middle  East,  America  believes  those  hopes  have  the  power  to  transform  lives   and  nations.   This  moment  is  both  an  opportunity  and  a  test  for  all  parties  in  the  Middle  East:  an  opportunity  to  lay  the   foundations  for  future  peace    a  test  to  show  who  is  serious  about  peace  and  who  is  not.  The  choice  here  is   stark  and  simple.  The  Bible  says,  ""I  have  set  before  you  life  and  death    therefore,  choose  life.""  The  time  has   arrived  for  everyone  in  this  conflict  to  choose  peace,  and  hope,  and  life.   Thank  you  very  much.",bush
"Yesterday we remembered the innocent lives taken that terrible morning. Today we turn tothe urgent duty of protecting other lives without illusion and without fear. We've accomplished much in the last year in Afghanistan and beyond. We have much yet todo in Afghanistan and beyond. Many nations represented here have joined in the fight againstglobal terror and the people of the United States are grateful. The United Nations was born in the hope that survived a world war, the hope of a worldmoving toward justice, escaping old patterns of conflict and fear. The founding membersresolved that the peace of the world must never again be destroyed by the will andwickedness of any man. We created a United Nations Security Council so that, unlike the League of Nations, ourdeliberations would be more than talk, our resolutions would be more than wishes. Aftergenerations of deceitful dictators and broken treaties and squandered lives, we've dedicatedourselves to standards of human dignity shared by all and to a system of security defended byall. Today, these standards and this security are challenged. Our commitment to human dignity is challenged by persistent poverty and raging disease. Thesuffering is great. And our responsibilities are clear. The United States is joining with theworld to supply aid where it reaches people and lifts up lives, to extend trade and theprosperity it brings, and to bring medical care where it is desperately needed. As a symbol ofour commitment to human dignity. The United States will return to UNESCO. This organization has been reformed, and America will participate fully in its mission toadvance human rights and tolerance and learning. Our common security is challenged byregional conflicts, ethnic and religious strife that is ancient, but not inevitable. In the Middle East there can be no peace for either side without freedom for both sides. America stands committed to an independent and democratic Palestine, living side-by-sidewith Israel in peace and security. Like all other people, Palestinians deserve a governmentthat serves their interests and listens to their voices. My nation will continue to encourage allparties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and comprehensive settlement tothe conflict. Above all, our principles and our security are challenged today by outlaw groups and regimesthat accept no law of morality and have no limit to their violent ambitions. In the attacks onAmerica a year ago, we saw the destructive intentions of our enemies. This threat hides withinmany nations, including my own. In cells, in camps, terrorists are plotting further destruction and building new bases for theirwar against civilization. And our greatest fear is that terrorists will find a shortcut to their madambitions when an outlaw regime supplies them with the technologies to kill on a massivescale. In one place and one regime, we find all these dangers in their most lethal andaggressive forms, exactly the kind of aggressive threat the United Nations was born toconfront. Twelve years ago, Iraq invaded Kuwait without provocation. And the regime's forces werepoised to continue their march to seize other countries and their resources. Had SaddamHussein been appeased instead of stopped, he would have endangered the peace and stabilityof the world. Yet this aggression was stopped by the might of coalition forces and the will ofthe United Nations. To suspend hostilities, to spare himself, Iraq's dictator accepted a series of commitments. Theterms were clear to him and to all, and he agreed to prove he is complying with every one ofthose obligations. He has proven instead only his contempt for the United Nations and for allhis pledges. By breaking every pledge, by his deceptions and by his cruelties, Saddam Husseinhas made the case against himself. In 1991, Security Council Resolution 688 demanded that the Iraqi regime cease at once therepression of its own people, including the systematic repression of minorities, which thecouncil said threatened international peace and security in the region. This demand goesignored. Last year, the U.N. Commission on Human Rights found that Iraq continues to commitextremely grave violations of human rights and that the regime's repression is all-pervasive. Tens of thousands of political opponents and ordinary citizens have been subjected toarbitrary arrest and imprisonment, summary execution and torture by beating and burning,electric shock, starvation, mutilation and rape. Wives are tortured in front of their husbands; children in the presence of their parents; and allof these horrors concealed from the world by the apparatus of a totalitarian state. In 1991, the U.N. Security Council, through Resolutions 686 and 687, demanded that Iraqreturn all prisoners from Kuwait and other lands. Iraq's regime agreed. It broke this promise. Last year, the Secretary General's high-level coordinator for this issue reported that Kuwaiti,Saudi, Indian, Syrian, Lebanese, Iranian, Egyptian, Bahraini and Armeni nationals remainunaccounted for; more than 600 people. One American pilot is among them. In 1991, the U.N. Security Council through Resolution 687 demanded that Iraq renounce allinvolvement with terrorism and permit no terrorist organizations to operate in Iraq. Iraq's regime agreed that broke this promise. In violation of Security Council Resolution 1373, Iraq continues to shelter and support terroristorganizations that direct violence against Iran, Israel and Western governments. Iraqidissidents abroad are targeted for murder. In 1993, Iraq attempted to assassinate the Amir of Kuwait and a former American president.Iraq's government openly praised the attacks of September 11. And Al Qaeda terroristsescaped from Afghanistan and are known to be in Iraq. In 1991, the Iraqi regime agreed destroy and stop developing all weapons of mass destructionand long range missiles and to prove to the world it has done so by complying with rigorousinspections. Iraq has broken every aspect of this fundamental pledge. From 1991 to 1995, the Iraqi regime said it had no biological weapons. After a senior officialin its weapons program defected and exposed this lie, the regime admitted to producing tensof thousands of liters of anthrax and other deadly biological agents for use with scudwarheads, aerial bombs and aircraft spray tanks. U.N. inspectors believe Iraq has produced two to four times the amount of biological agents itdeclared and has failed to account for more than three metric tons of material that could beused to produce biological weapons. Right now, Iraq is expanding and improving facilities thatwere used for the production of biological weapons. United Nations' inspections also reviewed that Iraq like maintains stockpiles of VX, mustardand other chemical agents, and that the regime is rebuilding and expanding facilities capableof producing chemical weapons. And in 1995, after four years of deception, Iraq finally admitted it had a crash nuclearweapons program prior to the Gulf War. We know now, were it not for that war, the regime in Iraq would likely have possessed anuclear weapon no later than 1993. Today, Iraq continues to withhold important information about its nuclear program, weaponsdesign, procurement logs, experiment data, and accounting of nuclear materials anddocumentation of foreign assistance. Iraq employs capable nuclear scientists and technicians.It retains physical infrastructure needed to build a nuclear weapon. Iraq has made several attempts to buy high-strength aluminum tubes used to enrich uraniumfor a nuclear weapon. Should Iraq acquire fissile material, it would be able to build a nuclearweapon within a year. And Iraq's state-controlled media has reported numerous meetings between Saddam Husseinand his nuclear scientists, leaving little doubt about his continued appetite for these weapons. Iraq also possesses a force of SCUD type missiles with ranges beyond the 150 kilometerspermitted by the U.N. Work at testing and production facilities shows that Iraq is buildingmore long range missiles that can inflict mass death throughout the region. In 1990, after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the world imposed economic sanctions on Iraq. Thosesanctions were maintained after the war to compel the regime's compliance with SecurityCouncil Resolutions. In time, Iraq was allowed to use oil revenues to buy food. Saddam Hussein has subverted thisprogram, working around the sanctions to buy missile technology and military materials. Heblames the suffering of Iraq's people on the United Nations, even as he uses his oil wealth tobuild lavish palaces for himself and to buy arms for his country. By refusing to comply with his own agreements, he bears full guilt for the hunger and miseryof innocent Iraqi citizens. In 1991, Iraq promised U.N. inspectors immediate and unrestrictedaccess to verify Iraq's commitment to rid itself of weapons of mass destruction and long rangemissiles. Iraq broke this promise, spending seven years deceiving, evading and harassing U.N.inspectors before ceasing cooperation entirely. Just months after the 1991 cease-fire, the Security Council twice renewed its demand that theIraqi regime cooperate fully with inspectors, condemning Iraq's serious violations of itsobligations. The Security Council again renewed that demand in 1994, and twice more in 1996, deploringIraq's clear violations of its obligations. The Security Council renewed its demand three moretimes in 1997, citing flagrant violations, and three more times in 1998, calling Iraq's behaviortotally unacceptable. And in 1999, the demand was renewed yet again. As we meet today, it's been almost four years since the last U.N. inspector set foot in Iraq --four years for the Iraqi regime to plan and to build and to test behind the cloak of secrecy. Weknow that Saddam Hussein pursued weapons of mass murder even when inspectors were inhis country. Are we to assume that he stopped when they left? The history, the logic and the facts lead to one conclusion: Saddam Hussein regime is a graveand gathering danger. To suggest otherwise is to hope against the evidence. To assume this regime's good faith is tobet the lives of millions and the peace of the world in a reckless gamble, and this is a risk wemust not take. Delegates to the General Assembly, we have been more than patient. We've tried sanctions.We've tried the carrot of oil for food and the stick of coalition military strikes. But SaddamHussein has defied all these efforts and continues to develop weapons of mass destruction. The first time we may be completely certain he has nuclear weapons is when, God forbid, heuses one. We owe it to all our citizens to do everything in our power to prevent that day fromcoming. The conduct of the Iraqi regime is a threat to the authority of the United Nations and a threatto peace. Iraq has answered a decade of U.N. demands with a decade of defiance. All theworld now faces a test, and the United Nations a difficult and defining moment. Are Security Council resolutions to be honored and enforced or cast aside withoutconsequence? Will the United Nations serve the purpose of its founding or will it be irrelevant? The United States help found the United Nations. We want the United Nations to be effectiveand respectful and successful. We want the resolutions of the world's most importantmultilateral body to be enforced. And right now those resolutions are being unilaterallysubverted by the Iraqi regime. Our partnership of nations can meet the test before us by making clear what we now expectof the Iraqi regime. If the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will immediately and unconditionally forswear, disclose andremove or destroy all weapons of mass destruction, long-range missiles and all relatedmaterial. If the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will immediately end all support for terrorism and act tosuppress it -- as all states are required to do by U.N. Security Council resolutions. If the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will cease persecution of its civilian population, includingShi'a, Sunnis, Kurds, Turkemens and others -- again, as required by Security Councilresolutions. If the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will release or account for all Gulf War personnel whosefate is still unknown. It will return the remains of any who are deceased, return stolen property, accept liability forlosses resulting from the invasion of Kuwait and fully cooperate with international efforts toresolve these issues as required by Security Council resolutions. If the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will immediately end all illicit trade outside the oil-for-foodprogram. It will accept U.N. administration of funds from that program to ensure that themoney is used fairly and promptly for the benefit of the Iraqi people. If all these steps are taken, it will signal a new openness and accountability in Iraq and itcould open the prospect of the United Nations helping to build a government that representsall Iraqis, a government based on respect for human rights, economic liberty andinternationally supervised elections. The United States has no quarrel with the Iraqi people. They've suffered too long in silentcaptivity. Liberty for the Iraqi people is a great moral cause and a great strategic goal. The people of Iraq deserve it. The security of all nations requires it. Free societies do notintimidate through cruelty and conquest. And open societies do not threaten the world withmass murder. The United States supports political and economic liberty in a unified Iraq. We can harbor no illusions, and that's important today to remember. Saddam Husseinattacked Iran in 1980 and Kuwait in 1990. He's fired ballistic missiles at Iran and SaudiArabia, Bahrain and Israel. His regime once ordered the killing of every person between theages of 15 and 70 in certain Kurdish villages in northern Iraq. He has gassed many Iraniansand 40 Iraqi villages. My nation will work with the U.N. Security Council to meet our common challenge. If Iraq'sregime defies us again, the world must move deliberately, decisively to hold Iraq to account.We will work with the U.N. Security Council for the necessary resolutions. But the purposes of the United States should not be doubted. The Security Council resolutionswill be enforced, the just demands of peace and security will be met or action will beunavoidable and a regime that has lost its legitimacy will also lose its power. Events can turn in one of two ways. If we fail to act in the face of danger, the people of Iraqwill continue to live in brutal submission. The regime will have new power to bully anddominate and conquer its neighbors, condemning the Middle East to more years of bloodshedand fear. The regime will remain unstable -- the region will remain unstable, with little hope offreedom and isolated from the progress of our times. With every step the Iraqi regime takes toward gaining and deploying the most terribleweapons, our own options to confront that regime will narrow. And if an emboldened regimewere to supply these weapons to terrorists allies, then the attacks of September 11 would bea prelude to far greater horrors. If we meet our responsibilities, if we overcome this danger, we can arrive at a very differentfuture. The people of Iraq can shake off their captivity. They can one day join a democraticAfghanistan and a democratic Palestine inspiring reforms throughout the Muslim world. Thesenations can show by their example that honest government and respect for women and thegreat Islamic tradition of learning can triumph in the Middle East and beyond. And we willshow that the promise of the United Nations can be fulfilled in our time. Neither of these outcomes is certain. Both have been set before us. We must choose betweena world of fear and a world of progress. We cannot stand by and do nothing while dangersgather. We must stand up for our security and for the permanent rights and the hopes ofmankind. By heritage and by choice, the United States of America will make that stand. And, delegatesto the United Nations, you have the power to make that stand, as well. Thank you very much.",bush
"Thank you for that very gracious and warm Cincinnati welcome. I'm honored to be heretonight; I appreciate you all coming. Tonight I want to take a few minutes to discuss a grave threat to peace, and America'sdetermination to lead the world in confronting that threat. The threat comes from Iraq. It arises directly from the Iraqi regime's own actions -- its history of aggression, and its drive toward an arsenal of terror. Eleven years ago, as a condition for ending the Persian Gulf War, the Iraqi regime was required to destroy its weapons of mass destruction, to cease all development of such weapons, and to stop all support for terrorist groups. The Iraqi regime has violated all of those obligations. It possesses and produces chemical and biological weapons. It is seeking nuclear weapons. It has given shelter and support to terrorism, and practices terror against its own people. The entire world haswitnessed Iraq's eleven-year history of defiance, deception and bad faith. We also must never forget the most vivid events of recent history. On September the 11th, 2001, America felt its vulnerability -- even to threats that gather on the other side of the earth. We resolved then, and we are resolved today, to confront every threat, from anysource, that could bring sudden terror and suffering to America. Members of the Congress of both political parties, and members of the United Nations Security Council, agree that Saddam Hussein is a threat to peace and must disarm. We agree that the Iraqi dictator must not be permitted to threaten America and the world with horrible poisons and diseases and gases and atomic weapons. Since we all agree on this goal, the issues is :how can we best achieve it? Many Americans have raised legitimate questions: about the nature of the threat; about the urgency of action -- why be concerned now; about the link between Iraq developing weapons of terror, and the wider war on terror. These are all issues we've discussed broadly and fullywithin my administration. And tonight, I want to share those discussions with you. First, some ask why Iraq is different from other countries or regimes that also have terrible weapons. While there are many dangers in the world, the threat from Iraq stands alone -- because it gathers the most serious dangers of our age in one place. Iraq's weapons of mass destruction are controlled by a murderous tyrant who has already used chemical weapons to kill thousands of people. This same tyrant has tried to dominate the Middle East, has invaded and brutally occupied a small neighbor, has struck other nations without warning, and holdsan unrelenting hostility toward the United States. By its past and present actions, by its technological capabilities, by the merciless nature of its regime, Iraq is unique. As a former chief weapons inspector of the U.N. has said, ""The fundamental problem with Iraq remains the nature of the regime, itself. Saddam Hussein is ahomicidal dictator who is addicted to weapons of mass destruction."" Some ask how urgent this danger is to America and the world. The danger is already significant, and it only grows worse with time. If we know Saddam Hussein has dangerous weapons today -- and we do -- does it make any sense for the world to wait to confront himas he grows even stronger and develops even more dangerous weapons? In 1995, after several years of deceit by the Iraqi regime, the head of Iraq's military industries defected. It was then that the regime was forced to admit that it had produced more than 30,000 liters of anthrax and other deadly biological agents. The inspectors, however, concluded that Iraq had likely produced two to four times that amount. This is a massive stockpile of biological weapons that has never been accounted for,and capable of killing millions. We know that the regime has produced thousands of tons of chemical agents, including mustard gas, sarin nerve gas, VX nerve gas. Saddam Hussein also has experience in using chemical weapons. He has ordered chemical attacks on Iran, and on more than forty villages in his own country. These actions killed or injured at least 20,000 people, more than six timesthe number of people who died in the attacks of September the 11th. And surveillance photos reveal that the regime is rebuilding facilities that it had used to produce chemical and biological weapons. Every chemical and biological weapon that Iraq has or makes is a direct violation of the truce that ended the Persian Gulf War in 1991. Yet, Saddam Hussein has chosen to build and keep these weapons despite international sanctions,U.N. demands, and isolation from the civilized world. Iraq possesses ballistic missiles with a likely range of hundreds of miles -- far enough to strike Saudi Arabia, Israel, Turkey, and other nations -- in a region where more than 135,000 American civilians and service members live and work. We've also discovered through intelligence that Iraq has a growing fleet of manned and unmanned aerial vehicles that could be used to disperse chemical or biological weapons across broad areas. We're concerned that Iraq is exploring ways of using these UAVS for missions targeting the United States. And, of course, sophisticated delivery systems aren't required for a chemical or biological attack; all that might be required are a small container and one terrorist or Iraqi intelligence operative todeliver it. And that is the source of our urgent concern about Saddam Hussein's links to international terrorist groups. Over the years, Iraq has provided safe haven to terrorists such as Abu Nidal, whose terror organization carried out more than 90 terrorist attacks in 20 countries that killed or injured nearly 900 people, including 12 Americans. Iraq has also provided safe haven to Abu Abbas, who was responsible for seizing the Achille Lauro and killing an American passenger. And we know that Iraq is continuing to finance terror and gives assistance togroups that use terrorism to undermine Middle East peace. We know that Iraq and the al Qaeda terrorist network share a common enemy -- the United States of America. We know that Iraq and al Qaeda have had high-level contacts that go back a decade. Some al Qaeda leaders who fled Afghanistan went to Iraq. These include one very senior al Qaeda leader who received medical treatment in Baghdad this year, and who has been associated with planning for chemical and biological attacks. We've learned that Iraq has trained al Qaeda members in bomb-making and poisons and deadly gases. And we know that after September the 11th, Saddam Hussein's regime gleefullycelebrated the terrorist attacks on America. Iraq could decide on any given day to provide a biological or chemical weapon to a terrorist group or individual terrorists. Alliance with terrorists could allow the Iraqi regime to attackAmerica without leaving any fingerprints. Some have argued that confronting the threat from Iraq could detract from the war against terror. To the contrary; confronting the threat posed by Iraq is crucial to winning the war on terror. When I spoke to Congress more than a year ago, I said that those who harbor terrorists are as guilty as the terrorists themselves. Saddam Hussein is harboring terrorists and the instruments of terror, the instruments of mass death and destruction. And he cannot be trusted. The risk is simply too great that he will use them, or provide them to a terrornetwork. Terror cells and outlaw regimes building weapons of mass destruction are different faces of the same evil. Our security requires that we confront both. And the United States military iscapable of confronting both. Many people have asked how close Saddam Hussein is to developing a nuclear weapon. Well, we don't know exactly, and that's the problem. Before the Gulf War, the best intelligence indicated that Iraq was eight to ten years away from developing a nuclear weapon. After the war, international inspectors learned that the regime has been much closer -- the regime in Iraq would likely have possessed a nuclear weapon no later than 1993. The inspectors discovered that Iraq had an advanced nuclear weapons development program, had a design for a workable nuclear weapon, and was pursuing several different methods of enrichinguranium for a bomb. Before being barred from Iraq in 1998, the International Atomic Energy Agency dismantled extensive nuclear weapons-related facilities, including three uranium enrichment sites. That same year, information from a high-ranking Iraqi nuclear engineer who had defected revealed that despite his public promises, Saddam Hussein had ordered his nuclear program tocontinue. The evidence indicates that Iraq is reconstituting its nuclear weapons program. Saddam Hussein has held numerous meetings with Iraqi nuclear scientists, a group he calls his ""nuclear mujahideen"" -- his nuclear holy warriors. Satellite photographs reveal that Iraq is rebuilding facilities at sites that have been part of its nuclear program in the past. Iraq has attempted to purchase high-strength aluminum tubes and other equipment needed for gascentrifuges, which are used to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons. If the Iraqi regime is able to produce, buy, or steal an amount of highly enriched uranium a little larger than a single softball, it could have a nuclear weapon in less than a year. And if we allow that to happen, a terrible line would be crossed. Saddam Hussein would be in a position to blackmail anyone who opposes his aggression. He would be in a position to dominate the Middle East. He would be in a position to threaten America. And Saddam Hussein would be ina position to pass nuclear technology to terrorists. Some citizens wonder, after 11 years of living with this problem, why do we need to confront it now? And there's a reason. We've experienced the horror of September the 11th. We have seen that those who hate America are willing to crash airplanes into buildings full of innocent people. Our enemies would be no less willing, in fact, they would be eager, to use biological orchemical, or a nuclear weapon. Knowing these realities, America must not ignore the threat gathering against us. Facing clear evidence of peril, we cannot wait for the final proof -- the smoking gun -- that could come in the form of a mushroom cloud. As President Kennedy said in October of 1962, ""Neither the United States of America, nor the world community of nations can tolerate deliberate deception and offensive threats on the part of any nation, large or small. We no longer live in a world,"" he said, ""where only the actual firing of weapons represents a sufficient challenge toa nations security to constitute maximum peril."" Understanding the threats of our time, knowing the designs and deceptions of the Iraqi regime, we have every reason to assume the worst, and we have an urgent duty to preventthe worst from occurring. Some believe we can address this danger by simply resuming the old approach to inspections, and applying diplomatic and economic pressure. Yet this is precisely what the world has tried to do since 1991. The U.N. inspections program was met with systematic deception. The Iraqi regime bugged hotel rooms and offices of inspectors to find where they were going next; they forged documents, destroyed evidence, and developed mobile weapons facilities to keep a step ahead of inspectors. Eight so-called presidential palaces were declared off-limits to unfettered inspections. These sites actually encompass twelve square miles, with hundreds of structures, both above andbelow the ground, where sensitive materials could be hidden. The world has also tried economic sanctions -- and watched Iraq use billions of dollars in illegal oil revenues to fund more weapons purchases, rather than providing for the needs ofthe Iraqi people. The world has tried limited military strikes to destroy Iraq's weapons of mass destructioncapabilities -- only to see them openly rebuilt, while the regime again denies they even exist. The world has tried no-fly zones to keep Saddam from terrorizing his own people -- and in the last year alone, the Iraqi military has fired upon American and British pilots more than 750times. After eleven years during which we have tried containment, sanctions, inspections, even selected military action, the end result is that Saddam Hussein still has chemical and biological weapons and is increasing his capabilities to make more. And he is moving ever closer todeveloping a nuclear weapon. Clearly, to actually work, any new inspections, sanctions or enforcement mechanisms will have to be very different. America wants the U.N. to be an effective organization that helps keep the peace. And that is why we are urging the Security Council to adopt a new resolution setting out tough, immediate requirements. Among those requirements: the Iraqi regime must reveal and destroy, under U.N. supervision, all existing weapons of mass destruction. To ensure that we learn the truth, the regime must allow witnesses to its illegal activities to be interviewed outside the country -- and these witnesses must be free to bring their families with them so they all beyond the reach of Saddam Hussein's terror and murder. And inspectors must have access to any site, at any time, without pre-clearance, without delay,without exceptions. The time for denying, deceiving, and delaying has come to an end. Saddam Hussein mustdisarm himself -- or, for the sake of peace, we will lead a coalition to disarm him. Many nations are joining us in insisting that Saddam Hussein's regime be held accountable. They are committed to defending the international security that protects the lives of both our citizens and theirs. And that's why America is challenging all nations to take the resolutions ofthe U.N. Security Council seriously. And these resolutions are clear. In addition to declaring and destroying all of its weapons of mass destruction, Iraq must end its support for terrorism. It must cease the persecution of its civilian population. It must stop all illicit trade outside the Oil For Food program. It must release or account for all Gulf War personnel, including an American pilot, whose fate is stillunknown. By taking these steps, and by only taking these steps, the Iraqi regime has an opportunity to avoid conflict. Taking these steps would also change the nature of the Iraqi regime itself. America hopes the regime will make that choice. Unfortunately, at least so far, we have little reason to expect it. And that's why two administrations -- mine and President Clinton's -- have stated that regime change in Iraq is the only certain means of removing a great dangerto our nation. I hope this will not require military action, but it may. And military conflict could be difficult. An Iraqi regime faced with its own demise may attempt cruel and desperate measures. If Saddam Hussein orders such measures, his generals would be well advised to refuse those orders. If they do not refuse, they must understand that all war criminals will be pursued and punished. If we have to act, we will take every precaution that is possible. We will plan carefully; we will act with the full power of the United States military; we will act with allies atour side, and we will prevail. There is no easy or risk-free course of action. Some have argued we should wait -- and that's an option. In my view, it's the riskiest of all options, because the longer we wait, the stronger and bolder Saddam Hussein will become. We could wait and hope that Saddam does not give weapons to terrorists, or develop a nuclear weapon to blackmail the world. But I'm convinced that is a hope against all evidence. As Americans, we want peace -- we work and sacrifice for peace. But there can be no peace if our security depends on the will and whims of a ruthless and aggressive dictator. I'm not willing to stake one American life on trusting SaddamHussein. Failure to act would embolden other tyrants, allow terrorists access to new weapons and new resources, and make blackmail a permanent feature of world events. The United Nations would betray the purpose of its founding, and prove irrelevant to the problems of our time.And through its inaction, the United States would resign itself to a future of fear. That is not the America I know. That is not the America I serve. We refuse to live in fear. This nation, in world war and in Cold War, has never permitted the brutal and lawless to set history's course. Now, as before, we will secure our nation, protect our freedom, and helpothers to find freedom of their own. Some worry that a change of leadership in Iraq could create instability and make the situation worse. The situation could hardly get worse, for world security and for the people of Iraq. The lives of Iraqi citizens would improve dramatically if Saddam Hussein were no longer in power, just as the lives of Afghanistan's citizens improved after the Taliban. The dictator of Iraq is a student of Stalin, using murder as a tool of terror and control, within his own cabinet, withinhis own army, and even within his own family. On Saddam Hussein's orders, opponents have been decapitated, wives and mothers of political opponents have been systematically raped as a method of intimidation, and politicalprisoners have been forced to watch their own children being tortured. America believes that all people are entitled to hope and human rights, to the non-negotiable demands of human dignity. People everywhere prefer freedom to slavery; prosperity to squalor; self-government to the rule of terror and torture. America is a friend to the people of Iraq. Our demands are directed only at the regime that enslaves them and threatens us. When these demands are met, the first and greatest benefit will come to Iraqi men, women and children. The oppression of Kurds, Assyrians, Turkomans, Shi'a, Sunnis and others will belifted. The long captivity of Iraq will end, and an era of new hope will begin. Iraq is a land rich in culture, resources, and talent. Freed from the weight of oppression, Iraq's people will be able to share in the progress and prosperity of our time. If military action is necessary, the United States and our allies will help the Iraqi people rebuild their economy,and create the institutions of liberty in a unified Iraq at peace with its neighbors. Later this week, the United States Congress will vote on this matter. I have asked Congress to authorize the use of America's military, if it proves necessary, to enforce U.N. Security Council demands. Approving this resolution does not mean that military action is imminent or unavoidable. The resolution will tell the United Nations, and all nations, that America speaks with one voice and is determined to make the demands of the civilized world mean something. Congress will also be sending a message to the dictator in Iraq: that his only chance -- hisonly choice is full compliance, and the time remaining for that choice is limited. Members of Congress are nearing an historic vote. I'm confident they will fully consider thefacts, and their duties. The attacks of September the 11th showed our country that vast oceans no longer protect us from danger. Before that tragic date, we had only hints of al Qaeda's plans and designs. Today in Iraq, we see a threat whose outlines are far more clearly defined, and whose consequences could be far more deadly. Saddam Hussein's actions have put us on notice, andthere is no refuge from our responsibilities. We did not ask for this present challenge, but we accept it. Like other generations of Americans, we will meet the responsibility of defending human liberty against violence and aggression. By our resolve, we will give strength to others. By our courage, we will give hopeto others. And by our actions, we will secure the peace, and lead the world to a better day. May God bless America.",bush
"Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, distinguished citizens, and fellow citizens: Every year, by law and by custom, we meet here to consider the state of the union.This year, we gather in this chamber deeply aware of decisive days that lie ahead. You and I serve our country in a time of great consequence. During this session of Congress, we have the duty to reform domestic programs vital to our country and we have the opportunity to save millions of lives abroad from a terrible disease. We will work for a prosperity that is broadly shared and we will answer every danger and every enemy that threatens the American people. In all these days of promise and days of reckoning, we can be confident. In a whirlwind of change, and hope, and peril, our faith is sure, our resolve is firm,and our union is strong. This country has many challenges. We will not deny, we will not ignore, we will not pass along our problems to other Congresses, other presidents, and other generations. We will confront them with focus, and clarity, and courage. During the last two years, we have seen what can be accomplished when we work together. To lift the standards of our public schools, we achieved historic education reform -- which must now be carried out in every school, and every classroom, so that every child in America can read, and learn, and succeed in life. To protect our country, we reorganized our government and created the Department of Homeland Security -- which is mobilizing against the threats of a new era. To bring our economy out of recession, we delivered the largest tax relief in a generation. To insist on integrity in American business, we passed tough reforms,and we are holding corporate criminals to account. Some might call this a good record. I call it a good start. Tonight I ask the House and Senate to join me in the next bold steps to serve our fellow citizens. Our first goal is clear: We must have an economy that grows fast enough to employ every man and woman who seeks a job. After recession, terrorist attacks, corporate scandals, and stock market declines, our economy is recovering -- yet it is not growing fast enough, or strongly enough. With unemployment rising, our Nation needs more small businesses to open, more companies to invest and expand, more employers to put up the sign that says, ""Help Wanted."" Jobs are created when the economy grows; the economy grows when Americans have more money to spend and invest; and the best, fairest way to make sure Americans have that money is not to tax itaway in the first place. I am proposing that all the income tax reductions set for 2004 and 2006 be made permanent and effective this year. And under my plan, as soon as I have signed the bill, this extra money will start showing up in workers' paychecks. Instead of gradually reducing the marriage penalty, we should do it now. Instead of slowly raising the child credit to a thousand dollars, we should send the checks to American families now. This tax relief is for everyone who pays income taxes -- and it will help our economy immediately. Ninety-two million Americans will keep -- this year -- an average of almost 1,100 dollars more of their own money. A family of four with an income of 40,000 dollars would see their federal income taxes fall from 1,178 dollars to 45 dollars per year. And our plan will improve the bottom line for more than 23million small businesses. You, the Congress, have already passed all these reductions, and promised them for future years. If this tax relief is good for Americans three, or five, or seven years from now, it is even better for Americans today. We also strengthen the economy by treating investors equally in our tax laws. It is fair to tax a company's profits. It is not fair to again tax the shareholder on the same profits. To boost investor confidence, and to help the nearly 10 million seniors who receive dividend income, I ask you to end the unfair double taxation of dividends. Lower taxes and greater investment will help this economy expand. More jobs mean more taxpayers -- and higher revenues to our government. The best way to address the deficit and move toward a balanced budget is to encourage economic growth -- and to show some spending discipline in Washington, D.C. We must work together to fund only our most important priorities. I will send you a budget that increases discretionary spending by four percent next year -- about as much as the average family's income is expected to grow. And that is a good benchmark for us: Federal spending should not rise any faster than the paychecks of American families. A growing economy, and a focus on essential priorities, will also be crucial to the future of Social Security. As we continue to work together to keep Social Security sound and reliable, we must offer younger workers a chance to invest in retirement accounts that they will control and theywill own. Our second goal is high quality, affordable health care for all Americans. The American system of medicine is a model of skill and innovation -- with a pace of discovery that is adding good years to our lives. Yet for many people, medical care costs too much -- and many have no coverage at all. These problems will not be solved with a nationalized health care system that dictates coverage and rations care. Instead, we must work toward a system in which all Americans have a good insurance policy, choose their own doctors, and seniors and low- income Americans receive the help they need. Instead of bureaucrats, and trial lawyers, andHMOs, we must put doctors, and nurses, and patients back in charge of American medicine. Health care reform must begin with Medicare, because Medicare is the binding commitment of a caring society. We must renew that commitment by giving seniors access to the preventive medicine and new drugs that are transforming health care in America. Seniors happy with the current Medicare system should be able to keep their coverage just the way it is. And just like you, the members of Congress, members of your staffs, and other federal employees, all seniors should have the choice of a health care plan that provides prescription drugs. My budget will commit an additional 400 billion dollars over the next decade to reform and strengthen Medicare. Leaders of both political parties have talked for years about strengthening Medicare -- I urge the members of this new Congress to act this year. To improve our health care system, we must address one of the prime causes of higher costs -- the constant threat that physicians and hospitals will be unfairly sued. Because of excessive litigation, everybody pays more for health care -- and many parts of America are losing fine doctors. No one has ever been healed by a frivolous lawsuit -- and I urge the Congress topass medical liability reform. Our third goal is to promote energy independence for our country, while dramatically improving the environment. I have sent you a comprehensive energy plan to promote energy efficiency and conservation, to develop cleaner technology, and to produce more energy at home. I have sent you Clear Skies legislation that mandates a 70 percent cut in air pollution from power plants over the next 15 years. I have sent you a Healthy Forests Initiative, to help prevent the catastrophic fires that devastate communities, kill wildlife, and burn away millionsof acres of treasured forest. I urge you to pass these measures, for the good of both our environment and our economy. Even more, I ask you to take a crucial step, and protect our environment in ways that generations before us could not have imagined. In this century, the greatest environmental progress will come about, not through endless lawsuits or command and control regulations, but through technology and innovation. Tonight I am proposing 1.2 billion dollars in research funding so that America can lead the world in developing clean, hydrogen-powered automobiles. A simple chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen generates energy, which can be used to power a car -- producing only water, not exhaust fumes. With a new national commitment, our scientists and engineers will overcome obstacles to taking these cars from laboratory to showroom -- so that the first car driven by a child born today could be powered by hydrogen, and pollution-free. Join me in this important innovation -- to make our air significantly cleaner, and our country much less dependent on foreign sources of energy. Our fourth goal is to apply the compassion of America to the deepest problems of America. For so many in our country -- the homeless, the fatherless, the addicted -- the need is great. Yet there is power -- wonder-working power -- in the goodness, and idealism, and faith of theAmerican people. Americans are doing the work of compassion every day -- visiting prisoners, providing shelter to battered women, bringing companionship to lonely seniors. These good works deserve our praise; they deserve our personal support; and, when appropriate, they deserve the assistance of our government. I urge you to pass both my faith-based initiative and the Citizen Service Act -- to encourageacts of compassion that can transform America, one heart and one soul at a time. Last year, I called on my fellow citizens to participate in USA Freedom Corps, which is enlisting tens of thousands of new volunteers across America. Tonight I ask Congress and the American people to focus the spirit of service and the resources of government on the needs of some of our most vulnerable citizens -- boys and girls trying to grow up without guidance and attention, and children who have to go through a prison gate to be hugged by their mom or dad. I propose a 450 million dollar initiative to bring mentors to more than a million disadvantaged junior high students and children of prisoners. Government will support the training and recruiting of mentors, yet it is the men and women of America who will fill the need. One mentor, one person, can change a life forever -- and I urge you to be that oneperson. Another cause of hopelessness is addiction to drugs. Addiction crowds out friendship, ambition, moral conviction, and reduces all the richness of life to a single destructive desire. As a government, we are fighting illegal drugs by cutting off supplies, and reducing demand through anti-drug education programs. Yet for those already addicted, the fight against drugs is a fight for their own lives. Too many Americans in search of treatment cannot get it. So tonight I propose a new 600 million dollar program to help an additional 300,000 Americansreceive treatment over the next three years. Our Nation is blessed with recovery programs that do amazing work. One of them is found at the Healing Place Church in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. A man in the program said, ""God does miracles in people's lives, and you never think it could be you."" Tonight, let us bring to all Americans who struggle with drug addiction this message of hope: The miracle of recovery is possible, and it could be you. By caring for children who need mentors, and for addicted men and women who need treatment, we are building a more welcoming society -- a culture that values every life. And in this work we must not overlook the weakest among us. I ask you to protect infants at the very hour of birth, and end the practice of partial-birth abortion. And because no human life should be started or ended as the object of an experiment, I ask you toset a high standard for humanity and pass a law against all human cloning. The qualities of courage and compassion that we strive for in America also determine our conduct abroad. The American flag stands for more than our power and our interests. Our Founders dedicated this country to the cause of human dignity -- the rights of every person and the possibilities of every life. This conviction leads us into the world to help the afflicted, and defend the peace, and confound the designs of evil men. In Afghanistan, we helped to liberate an oppressed people, and we will continue helping them secure their country, rebuild their society, and educate all their children -- boys and girls. In the Middle East, we will continue to seek peace between a secure Israel and a democratic Palestine. Across the earth, America is feeding the hungry; more than 60 percent of international food aid comes as a giftfrom the people of the United States. As our Nation moves troops and builds alliances to make our world safer, we must also remember our calling, as a blessed country, to make this world better. Today, on the continent of Africa, nearly 30 million people have the AIDS virus -- including three million children under the age of 15. There are whole countries in Africa where more than one-third of the adult population carries the infection. More than four million require immediate drug treatment. Yet across that continent, only 50,000 AIDS victims -- only 50,000 -- are receivingthe medicine they need. Because the AIDS diagnosis is considered a death sentence, many do not seek treatment. Almost all who do are turned away. A doctor in rural South Africa describes his frustration. He says, ""We have no medicines. Wany hospitals tell [people], 'You've got AIDS. We can't help you. Go home and die.'"" In an age of miraculous medicines, no person should have to hear those words. AIDS can be prevented. Anti-retroviral drugs can extend life for many years. And the cost of those drugs has dropped from 12,000 dollars a year to under 300 dollars a year --which places a tremendous possibility within our grasp. Ladies and gentlemen, seldom has history offered a greater opportunity to do so much for so many. We have confronted, and will continue to confront, HIV/AIDS in our own country. And to meet a severe and urgent crisis abroad, tonight I propose the Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief -- a work of mercy beyond all current international efforts to help the people of Africa. This comprehensive plan will prevent seven million new AIDS infections, treat at least two million people with life-extending drugs, and provide humane care for millions of people suffering from AIDS, and for children orphaned by AIDS. I ask the Congress to commit 15 billion dollars over the next five years, including nearly ten billion dollars in new money, to turn the tide against AIDS in the most afflicted nations ofAfrica and the Caribbean. This Nation can lead the world in sparing innocent people from a plague of nature. And this Nation is leading the world in confronting and defeating the man-made evil of international terrorism. There are days when the American people do not hear news about the war on terror. There is never a day when I do not learn of another threat, or receive reports of operations in progress, or give an order in this global war against a scattered network of killers. The war goes on, and we are winning. To date we have arrested, or otherwise dealt with, many key commanders of al-Qaida. They include a man who directed logistics and funding for the September 11th attacks, the chief of al-Qaida operations in the Persian Gulf who planned the bombings of our embassies in East Africa and the USS Cole, an al-Qaida operations chief from Southeast Asia, a former director of al-Qaida's training camps in Afghanistan, a key al-Qaida operative in Europe, and a major al-Qaida leader in Yemen. All told, more than 3,000 suspected terrorists have been arrested in many countries. And many others have met a different fate. They are no longer a problem for the United States and ourfriends and allies. We are working closely with other nations to prevent further attacks. America and coalition countries have uncovered and stopped terrorist conspiracies targeting the American embassy in Yemen, the American embassy in Singapore, a Saudi military base, and ships in the straits of Hormuz, and the straits of Gibraltar. We have broken al-Qaida cells in Hamburg, and Milan, and Madrid, and London, and Paris -- as well as Buffalo, New York. We have the terrorists on the run, and we are keeping them on the run. One by one, the terrorists are learning the meaning of American justice. As we fight this war, we will remember where it began -- here, in our own country. This government is taking unprecedented measures to protect our people and defend our homeland. We have intensified security at the borders and ports of entry, posted more than 50,000 newly trained federal screeners in airports, begun inoculating troops and first responders against smallpox, and are deploying the Nation's first early warning network of sensors to detect biological attack. And this year, for the first time, we arebeginning to field a defense to protect this Nation against ballistic missiles. I thank the Congress for supporting these measures. I ask you tonight to add to our future security with a major research and production effort to guard our people against bio- terrorism, called Project Bioshield. The budget I send you will propose almost six billion dollars to quickly make available effective vaccines and treatments against agents like anthrax, botulinum toxin, Ebola, and plague. We must assume that our enemies would use thesediseases as weapons, and we must act before the dangers are upon us. Since September 11th, our intelligence and law enforcement agencies have worked more closely than ever to track and disrupt the terrorists. The FBI is improving its ability to analyze intelligence, and transforming itself to meet new threats. And tonight, I am instructing the leaders of the FBI, Central Intelligence, Homeland Security, and the Department of Defense to develop a Terrorist Threat Integration Center, to merge and analyze all threat information in a single location. Our government must have the very best information possible, and we will use it to make sure the right people are in the right places to protect our citizens. Our war against terror is a contest of will, in which perseverance is power. In the ruins of two towers, at the western wall of the Pentagon, on a field in Pennsylvania, this Nation made a pledge, and we renew that pledge tonight: Whatever the duration of this struggle, and whatever the difficulties, we will not permit the triumph of violence in the affairs of men     freepeople will set the course of history. Today, the gravest danger in the war on terror, the gravest danger facing America and the world, is outlaw regimes that seek and possess nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. These regimes could use such weapons for blackmail, terror, and mass murder. They could also give or sell those weapons to their terrorist allies, who would use them without the least hesitation. This threat is new; America's duty is familiar. Throughout the 20th century, small groups of men seized control of great nations, built armies and arsenals, and set out to dominate the weak and intimidate the world. In each case, their ambitions of cruelty and murder had no limit. In each case, the ambitions of Hitlerism, militarism, and communism were defeated by the will of free peoples, by the strength of great alliances, and by the might of the United States of America. Now, in this century, the ideology of power and domination has appeared again, and seeks to gain the ultimate weapons of terror. Once again, this Nation and our friends are all that stand between a world at peace, and a world of chaos and constant alarm. Once again, we are called to defend the safety of our people, and the hopesof all mankind. And we accept this responsibility. America is making a broad and determined effort to confront these dangers. We have called on the United Nations to fulfill its charter, and stand by its demand that Iraq disarm. We are strongly supporting the International Atomic Energy Agency in its mission to track and control nuclear materials around the world. We are working with other governments to secure nuclear materials in the former Soviet Union, and to strengthen global treaties banning the productionand shipment of missile technologies and weapons of mass destruction. In all of these efforts, however, America's purpose is more than to follow a process -- it is to achieve a result: the end of terrible threats to the civilized world. All free nations have a stake in preventing sudden and catastrophic attack. We are asking them to join us, and many are doing so. Yet the course of this Nation does not depend on the decisions of others. Whatever action is required, whenever action is necessary, I will defend the freedom and security of the American people. Different threats require different strategies. In Iran, we continue to see a government that represses its people, pursues weapons of mass destruction, and supports terror. We also see Iranian citizens risking intimidation and death as they speak out for liberty, human rights, and democracy. Iranians, like all people, have a right to choose their own government, and determine their own destiny -- and the United States supports theiraspirations to live in freedom. On the Korean peninsula, an oppressive regime rules a people living in fear and starvation. Throughout the 1990s, the United States relied on a negotiated framework to keep North Korea from gaining nuclear weapons. We now know that the regime was deceiving the world, and developing those weapons all along. And today the North Korean regime is using its nuclear program to incite fear and seek concessions. America and the world will not be blackmailed. America is working with the countries of the region -- South Korea, Japan, China, and Russia -- to find a peaceful solution, and to show the North Korean government that nuclear weapons will bring only isolation, economic stagnation, and continued hardship. The North Korean regime will find respect in the world, and revival for its people, only when itturns away from its nuclear ambitions. Our Nation and the world must learn the lessons of the Korean peninsula, and not allow an even greater threat to rise up in Iraq. A brutal dictator, with a history of reckless aggression, with ties to terrorism, with great potential wealth, will not be permitted to dominate a vital region and threaten the United States. Twelve years ago, Saddam Hussein faced the prospect of being the last casualty in a war he had started and lost. To spare himself, he agreed to disarm of all weapons of mass destruction. For the next 12 years, he systematically violated that agreement. He pursued chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons even while inspectors were in his country. Nothing to date has restrained him from his pursuit of these weapons -- not economic sanctions, not isolation from the civilized world, not even cruise missile strikes on his military facilities. Almost three months ago, the United Nations Security Council gave Saddam Hussein his final chance to disarm. He has showninstead his utter contempt for the United Nations, and for the opinion of the world. The 108 UN weapons inspectors were not sent to conduct a scavenger hunt for hidden materials across a country the size of California. The job of the inspectors is to verify that Iraq's regime is disarming. It is up to Iraq to show exactly where it is hiding its banned weapons, lay those weapons out for the world to see, and destroy them as directed. Nothinglike this has happened. The United Nations concluded in 1999 that Saddam Hussein had biological weapons materials sufficient to produce over 25,000 liters of anthrax -- enough doses to kill several million people. He has not accounted for that material. He has given no evidence that he has destroyed it. The United Nations concluded that Saddam Hussein had materials sufficient to produce more than 38,000 liters of botulinum toxin -- enough to subject millions of people to death by respiratory failure. He has not accounted for that material. He has given no evidencethat he has destroyed it. Our intelligence officials estimate that Saddam Hussein had the materials to produce as much as 500 tons of sarin, mustard, and VX nerve agent. In such quantities, these chemical agents also could kill untold thousands. He has not accounted for these materials. He has given no evidence that he has destroyed them. U.S. intelligence indicates that Saddam Hussein had upwards of 30,000 munitions capable of delivering chemical agents. Inspectors recently turned up 16 of them, despite Iraq's recent declaration denying their existence. Saddam Hussein has not accounted for the remaining 29,984 of these prohibited munitions. He has given no evidence that he has destroyed them. From three Iraqi defectors we know that Iraq, in the late 1990s, had several mobile biological weapons labs. These are designed to produce germ warfare agents, and can be moved from place to place to evade inspectors. Saddam Hussein has not disclosed these facilities. He has given no evidence that he has destroyedthem. The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed in the 1990s that Saddam Hussein had an advanced nuclear weapons development program, had a design for a nuclear weapon, and was working on five different methods of enriching uranium for a bomb. The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa. Our intelligence sources tell us that he has attempted to purchase high strength aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production. Saddam Hussein has notcredibly explained these activities. He clearly has much to hide. The dictator of Iraq is not disarming. To the contrary, he is deceiving. From intelligence sources, we know, for instance, that thousands of Iraqi security personnel are at work hiding documents and materials from the UN inspectors -- sanitizing inspection sites, and monitoring the inspectors themselves. Iraqi officials accompany the inspectors in order to intimidate witnesses. Iraq is blocking U-2 surveillance flights requested by the United Nations. Iraqi intelligence officers are posing as the scientists inspectors are supposed to interview. Real scientists have been coached by Iraqi officials on what to say. And intelligence sources indicate that Saddam Hussein has ordered that scientists who cooperate with UN inspectors indisarming Iraq will be killed, along with their families. Year after year, Saddam Hussein has gone to elaborate lengths, spent enormous sums, taken great risks, to build and keep weapons of mass destruction -- but why? The only possible explanation, the only possible use he could have for those weapons, is to dominate, intimidate, or attack. With nuclear arms or a full arsenal of chemical and biological weapons, Saddam Hussein could resume his ambitions of conquest in the Middle East, and create deadly havoc in the region. And this Congress and the American people must recognize another threat. Evidence from intelligence sources, secret communications, and statements by people now in custody, reveal that Saddam Hussein aids and protects terrorists, including members of al-Qaida. Secretly, and without fingerprints, he could provide one of his hidden weapons toterrorists, or help them develop their own. Before September 11, 2001, many in the world believed that Saddam Hussein could be contained. But chemical agents and lethal viruses and shadowy terrorist networks are not easily contained. Imagine those 19 hijackers with other weapons, and other plans -- this time armed by Saddam Hussein. It would take just one vial, one canister, one crate slipped into this country to bring a day of horror like none we have ever known. We will do everything inour power to make sure that day never comes. Some have said we must not act until the threat is imminent. Since when have terrorists and tyrants announced their intentions, politely putting us on notice before they strike? If this threat is permitted to fully and suddenly emerge, all actions, all words, and all recriminations would come too late. Trusting in the sanity and restraint of Saddam Hussein is not a strategy,and it is not an option. This dictator, who is assembling the world's most dangerous weapons, has already used them on whole villages -- leaving thousands of his own citizens dead, blind, or disfigured. Iraqi refugees tell us how forced confessions are obtained -- by torturing children while their parents are made to watch. International human rights groups have catalogued other methods used in the torture chambers of Iraq: electric shock, burning with hot irons, drippingacid on the skin, mutilation with electric drills, cutting out tongues, and rape. If this is not evil, then evil has no meaning. And tonight I have a message for the brave and oppressed people of Iraq: Your enemy is not surrounding your country -- your enemy is ruling your country. And the day he and his regimeare removed from power will be the day of your liberation. The world has waited 12 years for Iraq to disarm. America will not accept a serious and mounting threat to our country, our friends, and our allies. The United States will ask the UN Security Council to convene on February 5th to consider the facts of Iraq's ongoing defiance of the world. Secretary of State Powell will present information and intelligence about Iraq's illegal weapons programs; its attempts to hide those weapons from inspectors; and its links to terrorist groups. We will consult, but let there be no misunderstanding: If Saddam Hussein does not fully disarm, for the safety of our people, and for the peace of the world, we will leada coalition to disarm him. Tonight I also have a message for the men and women who will keep the peace, members of the American Armed Forces: Many of you are assembling in and near the Middle East, and some crucial hours may lie ahead. In those hours, the success of our cause will depend on you. Your training has prepared you. Your honor will guide you. You believe in America, and America believes in you. Sending Americans into battle is the most profound decision a president can make. The technologies of war have changed. The risks and suffering of war have not. For the brave Americans who bear the risk, no victory is free from sorrow. This Nation fights reluctantly,because we know the cost, and we dread the days of mourning that always come. We seek peace. We strive for peace. And sometimes peace must be defended. A future lived at the mercy of terrible threats is no peace at all. If war is forced upon us, we will fight in a just cause and by just means -- sparing, in every way we can, the innocent. And if war is forced upon us, we will fight with the full force and might of the United States military -- and we will prevail. And as we and our coalition partners are doing in Afghanistan, we will bring tothe Iraqi people food, and medicines, and supplies and freedom. Many challenges, abroad and at home, have arrived in a single season. In two years, America has gone from a sense of invulnerability to an awareness of peril, from bitter division in small matters to calm unity in great causes. And we go forward with confidence, because this call of history has come to the right country. Americans are a resolute people, who have risen to every test of our time. Adversity has revealed the character of our country, to the world, and to ourselves. America is a strong Nation, and honorable in the use of our strength. We exercise power without conquest, and sacrifice for the liberty of strangers. Americans are a free people, who know that freedom is the right of every person and the future of everynation. The liberty we prize is not America's gift to the world, it is God's gift to humanity. We Americans have faith in ourselves -- but not in ourselves alone. We do not claim to know all the ways of Providence, yet we can trust in them, placing our confidence in the loving God behind all of life, and all of history. May He guide us now, and may God continue to bless theUnited States of America. Thank you.",bush
"My  fellow  Americans,  this  day  has  brought  terrible  news  and  great  sadness  to  our  country.  At   nine  o'clock  this  morning,  Mission  Control  in  Houston  lost  contact  with  our  Space  Shuttle   Columbia.  A  short  time  later,  debris  was  seen  falling  from  the  skies  above  Texas.  The   Columbia  is  lost    there  are  no  survivors.   On  board  was  a  crew  of  seven:  Colonel  Rick  Husband    Lt.  Colonel  Michael  Anderson     Commander  Laurel  Clark    Captain  David  Brown    Commander  William  McCool    Dr.  Kalpana   Chawla    and  Ilan  Ramon,  a  Colonel  in  the  Israeli  Air  Force.  These  men  and  women  assumed   great  risk  in  the  service  to  all  humanity.   In  an  age  when  space  flight  has  come  to  seem  almost  routine,  it  is  easy  to  overlook  the   dangers  of  travel  by  rocket,  and  the  difficulties  of  navigating  the  fierce  outer  atmosphere  of   the  Earth.  These  astronauts  knew  the  dangers,  and  they  faced  them  willingly,  knowing  they   had  a  high  and  noble  purpose  in  life.  Because  of  their  courage,  and  daring,  and  idealism,  we   will  miss  them  all  the  more.    All  Americans  today  are  thinking,  as  well,  of  the  families  of  these  men  and  women  who  have   been  given  this  sudden  shock  and  grief.  You're  not  alone.  Our  entire  nation  grieves  with  you.   And  those  you  loved  will  always  have  the  respect  and  gratitude  of  this  country.  The  cause  in   which  they  died  will  continue.  Mankind  is  led  into  the  darkness  beyond  our  world  by  the   inspiration  of  discovery  and  the  longing  to  understand.   Our  journey  into  space  will  go  on.   In  the  skies  today  we  saw  destruction  and  tragedy.  Yet  farther  than  we  can  see,  there  is   comfort  and  hope.  In  the  words  of  the  prophet  Isaiah,  ""Lift  your  eyes  and  look  to  the  heavens.   Who  created  all  these?  He  who  brings  out  the  starry  hosts  one  by  one  and  calls  them  each  by   name.  Because  of  His  great  power,  and  mighty  strength,  not  one  of  them  is  missing.""   The  same  Creator  who  names  the  stars  also  knows  the  names  of  the  seven  souls  we  mourn   today.  The  crew  of  the  shuttle  Columbia  did  not  return  safely  to  Earth    yet  we  can  pray  that   all  are  safely  home.   May  God  bless  the  grieving  families.  And  may        may  God  continue  to  bless  America.",bush
"Thank you. Don't go overboard. Sit down, please -- no place to sit. Okay, don't sit down. Thank you all for coming. Mr. Vice President, thank you very much. Chief of Staff Card, I'm honored to have you by my side. I started work this morning and there he was, smiling andready to go on behalf of the American people. The First Lady and I have -- are honored to be living here and we're honored to be hostingthis event, the first we've done in this glorious room since -- since the Inauguration. I want to thank the family members who are here; thank you for your sacrifice; thank you for the long hours, accepting the long hours that your loved one is about to put in on behalf of the American people. Some of the folks that are here have worked in past Administrations. Some of us, this is a new experience. But for all of us, it is an honor of a lifetime and it is ourprivilege to share this together. I am here to lead the Executive Branch of government. You all are here because you have my full confidence. And we are here with the same basic purpose: to serve the American people.We have all taken an oath, and from this moment on it is our jobs to honor it. Today, everything is so promising and new. My hope is that the day will never come when any of us take[s] this place for granted, and this honor for granted. As we serve, we must alwaysremember three things: First, we must remember the high standards that come with high office. This begins with careful adherence to the rules. I expect every member of this Administration to stay well within the boundaries that define legal and ethical conduct. This means avoiding even the appearance of problems. This means checking and, if need be, double-checking that the rules have been obeyed. This means never compromising those rules. No one in the White House should be afraid to confront the people they work for, for ethical concerns. And no one should hesitate to confront me, as well. We're all accountable to one another. And above all, we're all accountable to the law and to the American people. My White House Counsel, Al Gonzalez, is my point man on these issues. If you have even a hint of ethical doubt, I urge you to talk toAl. Second, we must remember that high standards of conduct involve not only obeying the law, but showing civility. As we go about our work there is no excuse for arrogance, and never a reason for disrespect toward others. People who work here are highly visible throughout the government. In many way -- In many of your dealings, you'll be the face and voice of the White House staff. You'll be my representative. I expect each of you, as an official of thisAdministration, to be an example of humility and decency and fairness. And, finally, we must all remember that we are here for a reason. You and I and the Vice President share the same goals for our country and the same commitment to achieving them. We are here to make progress. We are not here just to mark time. The next few weeks we'll affirm the central policy goals of this Administration, beginning this week with education reform. Everyone will know where we stand. Everyone will know where we're headed. Every morning I want you to remember these goals. Every evening I want you to review the progress we have made. I want it said of us, at the end of our service, that ""promises madewere promises kept."" On a mantle piece in this Great House is inscribed the prayer of John Adams, that only the ""wise"" and ""honest"" may ""rule under this roof.""1 He was speaking of those who live here. But wisdom and honesty are also required of those who work here. I know each of you is capable of meeting that charge. This is only our second day, but times [sic] moves fast around here.So let us begin the work we were hired to do and leave this a better place than we found it. God bless. 1 John Adams, Second President of the United States, Letter to Abigail, November 2, 1800, on moving into the White House",bush
"Their mission was almost complete, and we lost them so close to home. The men and womenof the Columbia had journeyed more than 6 million miles and were minutes away from arrivaland reunion. The loss was sudden and terrible, and for their families, the grief is heavy. Our nation sharesin your sorrow and in your pride. And today we remember not only one moment of tragedy,but seven lives of great purpose and achievement. To leave behind Earth and air and gravity is an ancient dream of humanity. For these seven, itwas a dream fulfilled. Each of these astronauts had the daring and discipline required of theircalling. Each of them knew that great endeavors are inseparable from great risks. And each ofthem accepted those risks willingly, even joyfully, in the cause of discovery. Rick Husband was a boy of four when he first thought of being an astronaut. As a man, and having become an astronaut, he found it was even more important to love hisfamily and serve his Lord. One of Rick's favorite hymns was, ""How Great Thou Art,"" whichoffers these words of praise: ""I see the stars. I hear the mighty thunder. Thy powerthroughout the universe displayed."" David Brown was first drawn to the stars as a little boy with a telescope in his back yard. He admired astronauts, but, as he said, ""I thought they were movie stars. Ithought I was kind of a normal kid."" David grew up to be a physician, an aviator who couldland on the deck of a carrier in the middle of the night, and a shuttle astronaut. His brotherasked him several weeks ago what would happen if something went wrong on their mission.David replied, ""This program will go on."" Michael Anderson always wanted to fly planes, and rose to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the Air Force. Along the way, he became a role model -- especially forhis two daughters and for the many children he spoke to in schools. He said to them,""Whatever you want to be in life, you're training for it now."" He also told his minister, ""If thisthing doesn't come out right, don't worry about me. I'm just going on higher."" Laurel Salton Clark was a physician and a flight surgeon who loved adventure, loved her work, loved her husband, and her son. A friend who heard Laurel speaking toMission Control said, ""There was a smile in her voice."" Laurel conducted some of theexperiments as Columbia orbited the Earth, and described seeing new life emerge from a tinycocoon. ""Life,"" she said, ""continues in a lot of places, and life is a magical thing."" None of our astronauts traveled a longer path to space than Kalpana Chawla. She left India as a student, but she would see the nation of her birth -- all of it -- fromhundreds of miles above. When the sad news reached her home town, an administrator at herhigh school recalled, ""She always said she wanted to reach the stars. She went there -- andbeyond."" Kalpana's native country mourns her today, and so does her adopted land. Ilan Ramon also flew above his home, the land of Israel. He said, ""The quiet that envelopes space makes the beauty even more powerful. And I only hope that the quietcan one day spread to my country."" Ilan was a patriot -- the devoted son of a holocaustsurvivor, served his country in two wars. ""Ilan,"" said his wife, Rona, ""left us at his peakmoment, in his favorite place, with people he loved."" The Columbia's pilot was Commander Willie McCool, whom friends knew as the most steady and dependable of men. In Lubbock today, they're thinking back to the EagleScout who became a distinguished Naval officer, and a fearless test pilot. One friendremembers Willie this way: ""He was blessed; and we were blessed to know him."" Our whole nation was blessed to have such men and women serving in our space program.Their loss is deeply felt, especially in this place, where so many of you called them friends.The people in NASA are being tested once again. In your grief, you are responding as yourfriends would have wished -- with focus, professionalism, and unbroken faith in the mission ofthis agency. Captain Brown was correct: America's space program will go on. This cause of exploration and discovery is not an option we choose; it is a desire written in thehuman heart. We are that part of creation which seeks to understand all creation. We find thebest among us, send them forth into unmapped darkness, and pray they will return. They goin peace for all mankind, and all mankind is in their debt. Yet, some explorers do not return. And the loss settles unfairly on a few. The families heretoday shared in the courage of those they loved. But now they must face life and grief withoutthem. The sorrow is lonely; but you are not alone. In time, you will find comfort and the graceto see you through. And in God's own time, we can pray that the day of your reunion willcome. And to the children who miss your Mom or Dad so much today, you need to know they loveyou, and that love will always be with you. They were proud of you. And you can be proud ofthem for the rest of your life. The final days of their own lives were spent looking down upon this Earth. And now, on everycontinent, in every land they could see, the names of these astronauts are known andremembered. They will always have an honored place in the memory of this country. Andtoday I offer the respect and gratitude of the people of the United States. May God bless you all.",bush
"Thanks for the warm welcome. I'm proud to be with the scholars, and the friends, and the supporters of the American Enterprise Institute. I want to thank you for overlooking my dress code violation. They were about to stop me at the door, but Irving Kristol said, ""I know thisguy, let him in."" Chris, thank you for your very kind introduction, and thank you for your leadership. I see many distinguished guests here tonight -- members of my Cabinet, members of Congress, Justice Scalia, Justice Thomas, and so many respected writers and policy experts. I'm always happy to see your Senior Fellow, Dr. Lynne Cheney. Lynne is a wise and thoughtful commentator on history and culture, and a dear friend to Laura and me. I'm also familiar with the good work of her husband -- You may remember him, the former director of my vicepresidential search committee. Thank God Dick Cheney said yes. Thanks for fitting me into the program tonight. I know I'm not the featured speaker. I'm just a warm-up act for Allan Meltzer. But I want to congratulate Dr. Meltzer for a lifetime ofachievement, and for tonight's well-deserved honor. Congratulations. At the American Enterprise Institute, some of the finest minds in our nation are at work on some of the greatest challenges to our nation. You do such good work that my administration has borrowed 20 such minds. I want to thank them for their service, but I also want to remind people that for 60 years, AEI scholars have made vital contributions to our country and to ourgovernment, and we are grateful for those contributions. We meet here during a crucial period in the history of our nation, and of the civilized world. Part of that history was written by others; the rest will be written by us. On a September morning, threats that had gathered for years, in secret and far away, led to murder in our country on a massive scale. As a result, we must look at security in a new way, because ourcountry is a battlefield in the first war of the 21st century. We learned a lesson: The dangers of our time must be confronted actively and forcefully, before we see them again in our skies and in our cities. And we set a goal: we will not allowthe triumph of hatred and violence in the affairs of men. Our coalition of more than 90 countries is pursuing the networks of terror with every tool of law enforcement and with military power. We have arrested, or otherwise dealt with, many key commanders of al Qaeda. Across the world, we are hunting down the killers one by one. We are winning. And we're showing them the definition of American justice. And we are opposing the greatest danger in the war on terror: outlaw regimes arming with weapons ofmass destruction. In Iraq, a dictator is building and hiding weapons that could enable him to dominate the Middle East and intimidate the civilized world -- and we will not allow it. This same tyrant has close ties to terrorist organizations, and could supply them with the terrible means to strike this country -- and America will not permit it. The danger posed by Saddam Hussein and his weapons cannot be ignored or wished away. The danger must be confronted. We hope that the Iraqi regime will meet the demands of the United Nations and disarm, fully and peacefully. If it does not, we are prepared to disarm Iraq by force. Either way, this danger will beremoved. The safety of the American people depends on ending this direct and growing threat. Acting against the danger will also contribute greatly to the long-term safety and stability of our world. The current Iraqi regime has shown the power of tyranny to spread discord and violence in the Middle East. A liberated Iraq can show the power of freedom to transform that vital region, by bringing hope and progress into the lives of millions. America's interests in security, and America's belief in liberty, both lead in the same direction: to a free and peacefulIraq. The first to benefit from a free Iraq would be the Iraqi people, themselves. Today they live in scarcity and fear, under a dictator who has brought them nothing but war, and misery, and torture. Their lives and their freedom matter little to Saddam Hussein -- but Iraqi lives andfreedom matter greatly to us. Bringing stability and unity to a free Iraq will not be easy. Yet that is no excuse to leave the Iraqi regime's torture chambers and poison labs in operation. Any future the Iraqi people choose for themselves will be better than the nightmare world that Saddam Hussein haschosen for them. If we must use force, the United States and our coalition stand ready to help the citizens of a liberated Iraq. We will deliver medicine to the sick, and we are now moving into place nearly 3million emergency rations to feed the hungry. We'll make sure that Iraq's 55,000 food distribution sites, operating under the Oil For Food program, are stocked and open as soon as possible. The United States and Great Britain are providing tens of millions of dollars to the U.N. High Commission on Refugees, and to suchgroups as the World Food Program and UNICEF, to provide emergency aid to the Iraqi people. We will also lead in carrying out the urgent and dangerous work of destroying chemical and biological weapons. We will provide security against those who try to spread chaos, or settle scores, or threaten the territorial integrity of Iraq. We will seek to protect Iraq's natural resources from sabotage by a dying regime, and ensure those resources are used for thebenefit of the owners -- the Iraqi people. The United States has no intention of determining the precise form of Iraq's new government. That choice belongs to the Iraqi people. Yet, we will ensure that one brutal dictator is not replaced by another. All Iraqis must have a voice in the new government, and all citizens musthave their rights protected. Rebuilding Iraq will require a sustained commitment from many nations, including our own: we will remain in Iraq as long as necessary, and not a day more. America has made and kept this kind of commitment before -- in the peace that followed a world war. After defeating enemies, we did not leave behind occupying armies, we left constitutions and parliaments. We established an atmosphere of safety, in which responsible, reform-minded local leaders could build lasting institutions of freedom. In societies that once bred fascism and militarism, libertyfound a permanent home. There was a time when many said that the cultures of Japan and Germany were incapable of sustaining democratic values. Well, they were wrong. Some say the same of Iraq today. They are mistaken. The nation of Iraq -- with its proud heritage, abundant resources and skilledand educated people -- is fully capable of moving toward democracy and living in freedom. The world has a clear interest in the spread of democratic values, because stable and free nations do not breed the ideologies of murder. They encourage the peaceful pursuit of a better life. And there are hopeful signs of a desire for freedom in the Middle East. Arab intellectuals have called on Arab governments to address the ""freedom gap"" so their peoples can fully share in the progress of our times. Leaders in the region speak of a new Arab charter that champions internal reform, greater politics participation, economic openness, and free trade. And from Morocco to Bahrain and beyond, nations are taking genuine steps toward politics reform. A new regime in Iraq would serve as a dramatic and inspiring example of freedom forother nations in the region. It is presumptuous and insulting to suggest that a whole region of the world -- or the one-fifth of humanity that is Muslim -- is somehow untouched by the most basic aspirations of life. Human cultures can be vastly different. Yet the human heart desires the same good things, everywhere on Earth. In our desire to be safe from brutal and bullying oppression, human beings are the same. In our desire to care for our children and give them a better life, we are the same. For these fundamental reasons, freedom and democracy will always andeverywhere have greater appeal than the slogans of hatred and the tactics of terror. Success in Iraq could also begin a new stage for Middle Eastern peace, and set in motion progress towards a truly democratic Palestinian state. The passing of Saddam Hussein's regime will deprive terrorist networks of a wealthy patron that pays for terrorist training, and offers rewards to families of suicide bombers. And other regimes will be given a clear warningthat support for terror will not be tolerated. Without this outside support for terrorism, Palestinians who are working for reform and long for democracy will be in a better position to choose new leaders. True leaders who strive for peace; true leaders who faithfully serve the people. A Palestinian state must be a reformedand peaceful state that abandons forever the use of terror. For its part, the new government of Israel -- as the terror threat is removed and security improves -- will be expected to support the creation of a viable Palestinian state and to work as quickly as possible toward a final status agreement. As progress is made toward peace, settlement activity in the occupied territories must end. And the Arab states will be expected to meet their responsibilities to oppose terrorism, to support the emergence of a peaceful anddemocratic Palestine, and state clearly they will live in peace with Israel. The United States and other nations are working on a road map for peace. We are setting out the necessary conditions for progress toward the goal of two states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security. It is the commitment of our government -- and my personal commitment -- to implement the road map and to reach that goal. Old patterns of conflict in the Middle East can be broken, if all concerned will let go of bitterness, hatred, and violence, and get on with the serious work of economic development, and political reform, and reconciliation. America will seize every opportunity in pursuit of peace. And the end of thepresent regime in Iraq would create such an opportunity. In confronting Iraq, the United States is also showing our commitment to effective international institutions. We are a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. We helped to create the Security Council. We believe in the Security Council -- so much thatwe want its words to have meaning. The global threat of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction cannot be confronted by one nation alone. The world needs today and will need tomorrow international bodies with the authority and the will to stop the spread of terror and chemical and biological and nuclear weapons. A threat to all must be answered by all. High-minded pronouncements against proliferation mean little unless the strongest nations are willing to stand behind them -- and use force if necessary. After all, the United Nations was created, as Winston Churchill said, to ""make sure that the force of right will, in the ultimate issue, be protected by the right offorce."" Another resolution is now before the Security Council. If the council responds to Iraq's defiance with more excuses and delays, if all its authority proves to be empty, the United Nations will be severely weakened as a source of stability and order. If the members rise tothis moment, then the Council will fulfill its founding purpose. I've listened carefully, as people and leaders around the world have made known their desire for peace. All of us want peace. The threat to peace does not come from those who seek to enforce the just demands of the civilized world; the threat to peace comes from those who flout those demands. If we have to act, we will act to restrain the violent, and defend the cause of peace. And by acting, we will signal to outlaw regimes that in this new century, theboundaries of civilized behavior will be respected. Protecting those boundaries carries a cost. If war is forced upon us by Iraq's refusal to disarm, we will meet an enemy who hides his military forces behind civilians, who has terrible weapons, who is capable of any crime. The dangers are real, as our soldiers, and sailors, airmen, and Marines fully understand. Yet, no military has ever been better prepared to meetthese challenges. Members of our Armed Forces also understand why they may be called to fight. They know that retreat before a dictator guarantees even greater sacrifices in the future. They know that America's cause is right and just: liberty for an oppressed people, and security for the American people. And I know something about these men and women who wear our uniform:they will complete every mission they are given with skill, and honor, and courage. Much is asked of America in this year 2003. The work ahead is demanding. It will be difficult to help freedom take hold in a country that has known three decades of dictatorship, secret police, internal divisions, and war. It will be difficult to cultivate liberty and peace in the Middle East, after so many generations of strife. Yet, the security of our nation and the hope of millions depend on us, and Americans do not turn away from duties because they are hard.We have met great tests in other times, and we will meet the tests of our time. We go forward with confidence, because we trust in the power of human freedom to change lives and nations. By the resolve and purpose of America, and of our friends and allies, we will make this an age of progress and liberty. Free people will set the course of history, and freepeople will keep the peace of the world. Thank you all, very much.",bush
"My fellow citizens, events in Iraq have now reached the final days of decision. For more than a decade, the United States and other nations have pursued patient and honorable efforts to disarm the Iraqi regime without war. That regime pledged to reveal and destroy all itsweapons of mass destruction as a condition for ending the Persian Gulf War in 1991. Since then, the world has engaged in 12 years of diplomacy. We have passed more than a dozen resolutions in the United Nations Security Council. We have sent hundreds of weaponsinspectors to oversee the disarmament of Iraq. Our good faith has not been returned. The Iraqi regime has used diplomacy as a ploy to gain time and advantage. It has uniformly defied Security Council resolutions demanding full disarmament. Over the years, U.N. weapon inspectors have been threatened by Iraqi officials, electronically bugged, and systematically deceived. Peaceful efforts to disarm the Iraqi regime have failed again and again -- becausewe are not dealing with peaceful men. Intelligence gathered by this and other governments leaves no doubt that the Iraq regime continues to possess and conceal some of the most lethal weapons ever devised. This regime has already used weapons of mass destruction against Iraq's neighbors and against Iraq'speople. The regime has a history of reckless aggression in the Middle East. It has a deep hatred of America and our friends. And it has aided, trained, and harbored terrorists, includingoperatives of al Qaeda. The danger is clear: using chemical, biological, or, one day, nuclear weapons, obtained with the help of Iraq, the terrorists could fulfill their stated ambitions and kill thousands orhundreds of thousands of innocent people in our country, or any other. The United States and other nations did nothing to deserve or invite this threat. But we will do everything to defeat it. Instead of drifting along toward tragedy, we will set a course toward safety. Before the day of horror can come, before it is too late to act, this danger will beremoved. The United States of America has the sovereign authority to use force in assuring its own national security. That duty falls to me, as Commander-in-Chief, by the oath I have sworn, bythe oath I will keep. Recognizing the threat to our country, the United States Congress voted overwhelmingly last year to support the use of force against Iraq. America tried to work with the United Nations to address this threat because we wanted to resolve the issue peacefully. We believe in the mission of the United Nations. One reason the U.N. was founded after the second world war was to confront aggressive dictators, actively and early, before they can attack the innocent and destroy the peace. In the case of Iraq, the Security Council did act, in the early 1990s. Under Resolutions 678 and 687 -- both still in effect -- the United States and our allies are authorized to use force in ridding Iraq of weapons of mass destruction. This is not a question of authority; it is aquestion of will. Last September, I went to the U.N. General Assembly and urged the nations of the world to unite and bring an end to this danger. On November 8th, the Security Council unanimously passed Resolution 1441, finding Iraq in material breach of its obligations, and vowing seriousconsequences if Iraq did not fully and immediately disarm. Today, no nation can possibly claim that Iraq has disarmed. And it will not disarm so long as Saddam Hussein holds power. For the last four-and-a-half months, the United States and our allies have worked within the Security Council to enforce that Council's long-standing demands. Yet, some permanent members of the Security Council have publicly announced they will veto any resolution that compels the disarmament of Iraq. These governments share our assessment of the danger, but not our resolve to meet it. Many nations, however, do have the resolve and fortitude to act against this threat to peace, and a broad coalition is now gathering to enforce the just demands of the world. The United Nations Security Council hasnot lived up to its responsibilities, so we will rise to ours. In recent days, some governments in the Middle East have been doing their part. They have delivered public and private messages urging the dictator to leave Iraq, so that disarmament can proceed peacefully. He has thus far refused. All the decades of deceit and cruelty have now reached an end. Saddam Hussein and his sons must leave Iraq within 48 hours. Their refusal to do so will result in military conflict, commenced at a time of our choosing. For their own safety, all foreign nationals -- including journalists and inspectors -- should leave Iraqimmediately. Many Iraqis can hear me tonight in a translated radio broadcast, and I have a message for them. If we must begin a military campaign, it will be directed against the lawless men who rule your country and not against you. As our coalition takes away their power, we will deliver the food and medicine you need. We will tear down the apparatus of terror and we will help you to build a new Iraq that is prosperous and free. In a free Iraq, there will be no more wars of aggression against your neighbors, no more poison factories, no more executions of dissidents, no more torture chambers and rape rooms. The tyrant will soon be gone. The dayof your liberation is near. It is too late for Saddam Hussein to remain in power. It is not too late for the Iraqi military to act with honor and protect your country by permitting the peaceful entry of coalition forces to eliminate weapons of mass destruction. Our forces will give Iraqi military units clear instructions on actions they can take to avoid being attacked and destroyed. I urge every member of the Iraqi military and intelligence services, if war comes, do not fight for a dyingregime that is not worth your own life. And all Iraqi military and civilian personnel should listen carefully to this warning: In any conflict, your fate will depend on your actions. Do not destroy oil wells, a source of wealth that belongs to the Iraqi people. Do not obey any command to use weapons of mass destruction against anyone, including the Iraqi people. War crimes will be prosecuted. War criminals willbe punished. And it will be no defense to say, ""I was just following orders."" Should Saddam Hussein choose confrontation, the American people can know that every measure has been taken to avoid war, and every measure will be taken to win it. Americans understand the costs of conflict because we have paid them in the past. War has no certainty,except the certainty of sacrifice. Yet, the only way to reduce the harm and duration of war is to apply the full force and might of our military, and we are prepared to do so. If Saddam Hussein attempts to cling to power, he will remain a deadly foe until the end. In desperation, he and terrorists groups might try to conduct terrorist operations against the American people and our friends. These attacks are not inevitable. They are, however, possible. And this very fact underscores the reason we cannot live under the threat of blackmail. The terrorist threat to America and the world will bediminished the moment that Saddam Hussein is disarmed. Our government is on heightened watch against these dangers. Just as we are preparing to ensure victory in Iraq, we are taking further actions to protect our homeland. In recent days, American authorities have expelled from the country certain individuals with ties to Iraqi intelligence services. Among other measures, I have directed additional security of our airports, and increased Coast Guard patrols of major seaports. The Department of Homeland Security is working closely with the nation's governors to increase armed security at criticalfacilities across America. Should enemies strike our country, they would be attempting to shift our attention with panic and weaken our morale with fear. In this, they would fail. No act of theirs can alter the course or shake the resolve of this country. We are a peaceful people -- yet we're not a fragile people, and we will not be intimidated by thugs and killers. If our enemies dare to strike us,they and all who have aided them, will face fearful consequences. We are now acting because the risks of inaction would be far greater. In one year, or five years, the power of Iraq to inflict harm on all free nations would be multiplied many times over. With these capabilities, Saddam Hussein and his terrorist allies could choose the moment of deadly conflict when they are strongest. We choose to meet that threat now,where it arises, before it can appear suddenly in our skies and cities. The cause of peace requires all free nations to recognize new and undeniable realities. In the 20th century, some chose to appease murderous dictators, whose threats were allowed to grow into genocide and global war. In this century, when evil men plot chemical, biological, and nuclear terror, a policy of appeasement could bring destruction of a kind never beforeseen on this earth. Terrorists and terror states do not reveal these threats with fair notice, in formal declarations -- and responding to such enemies only after they have struck first is not self-defense; it issuicide. The security of the world requires disarming Saddam Hussein now. As we enforce the just demands of the world, we will also honor the deepest commitments of our country. Unlike Saddam Hussein, we believe the Iraqi people are deserving and capable of human liberty. And when the dictator has departed, they can set an example to all the MiddleEast of a vital and peaceful and self-governing nation. The United States, with other countries, will work to advance liberty and peace in that region. Our goal will not be achieved overnight, but it can come over time. The power and appeal of human liberty is felt in every life and every land. And the greatest power of freedom is to overcome hatred and violence, and turn the creative gifts of men and women to the pursuitsof peace. That is the future we choose. Free nations have a duty to defend our people by uniting against the violent. And tonight, as we have done before, America and our allies accept thatresponsibility. Good night, and may God continue to bless America.",bush
"My  fellow  citizens,  at  this  hour,  American  and  coalition  forces  are  in  the  early  stages  of   military  operations  to  disarm  Iraq,  to  free  its  people,  and  to  defend  the  world  from  grave   danger.   On  my  orders,  coalition  forces  have  begun  striking  selected  targets  of  military  importance  to   undermine  Saddam  Hussein's  ability  to  wage  war.  These  are  opening  stages  of  what  will  be  a   broad  and  concerted  campaign.  More  than  35  countries  are  giving  crucial  support        from  the   use  of  naval  and  air  bases,  to  help  with  intelligence  and  logistics,  to  the  deployment  of  combat   units.  Every  nation  in  this  coalition  has  chosen  to  bear  the  duty  and  share  the  honor  of  serving   in  our  common  defense.   To  all  the  men  and  women  of  the  United  States  Armed  Forces  now  in  the  Middle  East,  the   peace  of  a  troubled  world  and  the  hopes  of  an  oppressed  people  now  depend  on  you.  That   trust  is  well  placed.   The  enemies  you  confront  will  come  to  know  your  skill  and  bravery.  The  people  you  liberate   will  witness  the  honorable  and  decent  spirit  of  the  American  military.  In  this  conflict,  America   faces  an  enemy  who  has  no  regard  for  conventions  of  war  or  rules  of  morality.  Saddam   Hussein  has  placed  Iraqi  troops  and  equipment  in  civilian  areas,  attempting  to  use  innocent   men,  women  and  children  as  shields  for  his  own  military        a  final  atrocity  against  his  people.    I  want  Americans  and  all  the  world  to  know  that  coalition  forces  will  make  every  effort  to   spare  innocent  civilians  from  harm.  A  campaign  on  the  harsh  terrain  of  a  nation  as  large  as   California  could  be  longer  and  more  difficult  than  some  predict.  And  helping  Iraqis  achieve  a   united,  stable,  and  free  country  will  require  our  sustained  commitment.   We  come  to  Iraq  with  respect  for  its  citizens,  for  their  great  civilization,  and  for  the  religious   faiths  they  practice.  We  have  no  ambition  in  Iraq,  except  to  remove  a  threat  and  restore   control  of  that  country  to  its  own  people.   I  know  that  the  families  of  our  military  are  praying  that  all  those  who  serve  will  return  safely   and  soon.  Millions  of  Americans  are  praying  with  you  for  the  safety  of  your  loved  ones  and  for   the  protection  of  the  innocent.  For  your  sacrifice,  you  have  the  gratitude  and  respect  of  the   American  people.  And  you  can  know  that  our  forces  will  be  coming  home  as  soon  as  their   work  is  done.   Our  nation  enters  this  conflict  reluctantly        yet,  our  purpose  is  sure.  The  people  of  the  United   States  and  our  friends  and  allies  will  not  live  at  the  mercy  of  an  outlaw  regime  that  threatens   the  peace  with  weapons  of  mass  murder.  We  will  meet  that  threat  now,  with  our  Army,  Air   Force,  Navy,  Coast  Guard  and  Marines,  so  that  we  do  not  have  to  meet  it  later  with  armies  of   fire  fighters  and  police  and  doctors  on  the  streets  of  our  cities.   Now  that  conflict  has  come,  the  only  way  to  limit  its  duration  is  to  apply  decisive  force.  And  I   assure  you,  this  will  not  be  a  campaign  of  half  measures,  and  we  will  accept  no  outcome  but   victory.   My  fellow  citizens,  the  dangers  to  our  country  and  the  world  will  be  overcome.  We  will  pass   through  this  time  of  peril  and  carry  on  the  work  of  peace.  We  will  defend  our  freedom.  We  will   bring  freedom  to  others  and  we  will  prevail.   May  God  bless  our  country  and  all  who  defend  her.",bush
"President  Bush:  This  is  George  W  Bush,  the  President  of  the  United  States.  At  this  moment,   the  regime  of  Saddam  Hussein  is  being  removed  from  power,  and  a  long  era  of  fear  and   cruelty  is  ending.  American  and  coalition  forces  are  now  operating  inside  Baghdad        and  we   will  not  stop  until  Saddam   s  corrupt  gang  is  gone.  The  government  of  Iraq,  and  the  future  of   your  country,  will  soon  belong  to  you.   The  goals  of  our  coalition  are  clear  and  limited.  We  will  end  a  brutal  regime,  whose  aggression   and  weapons  of  mass  destruction  make  it  a  unique  threat  to  the  world.  Coalition  forces  will   help  maintain  law  and  order,  so  that  Iraqis  can  live  in  security.  We  will  respect  your  great   religious  traditions,  whose  principles  of  equality  and  compassion  are  essential  to  Iraq   s  future.   We  will  help  you  build  a  peaceful  and  representative  government  that  protects  the  rights  of  all   citizens.  And  then  our  military  forces  will  leave.  Iraq  will  go  forward  as  a  unified,  independent,   and  sovereign  nation  that  has  regained  a  respected  place  in  the  world.   The  United  States  and  its  coalition  partners  respect  the  people  of  Iraq.  We  are  taking   unprecedented  measures  to  spare  the  lives  of  innocent  Iraqi  citizens.  We  are  beginning  to   deliver  food  and  water  and  medicine  to  those  in  need.  Our  only  enemy  is  Saddam  and  his   brutal  regime        and  that  regime  is  your  enemy  as  well.    In  the  new  era  that  is  coming  to  Iraq,  your  country  will  no  longer  be  held  captive  to  the  will  of   a  cruel  dictator.  You  will  be  free,  free  to  build  a  better  life,  instead  of  building  more  palaces  for   Saddam  and  his  sons,  free  to  pursue  economic  prosperity  without  the  hardship  of  economic   sanctions,  free  to  travel  and  free  speak  your  mind,  free  to  join  in  the  political  affairs  of  Iraq.   And  all  the  people  who  make  up  your  country        Kurds,  Shi   a,  Turkomans,  Sunnis,  and  others         will  be  free  of  the  terrible  persecution  that  so  many  have  endured.   The  nightmare  that  Saddam  Hussein  has  brought  to  your  nation  will  soon  be  over.  You  are  a   good  and  gifted  people        the  heirs  of  a  great  civilization  that  contributes  to  all  humanity.  You   deserve  better  than  tyranny  and  corruption  and  torture  chambers.  You  deserve  to  live  as  free   people.  And  I  assure  every  citizen  of  Iraq:  Your  nation  will  soon  be  free.   Thank  you.   Prime  Minister  Blair:  I'm  glad  to  be  able  to  speak  to  you  today  to  tell  you  that  Saddam   Hussein's  regime  is  collapsing    that  the  years  of  brutality,  oppression,  and  fear  are  coming  to   an  end    that  a  new  and  better  future  beckons  for  the  people  of  Iraq.   We  did  not  want  this  war.  But  in  refusing  to  give  up  his  weapons  of  mass  destruction,  Saddam   gave  us  no  choice  but  to  act.  Now  that  the  war  has  begun,  it  will  be  seen  through  to  the  end.   We  will  continue  to  do  all  we  can  to  avoid  civilian  casualties.  Our  enemy  is  Saddam  and  his   regime,  not  the  Iraqi  people.  Our  forces  are  friends  and  liberators  of  the  Iraqi  people,  not  your   conquerors.  And  they  will  not  stay  a  day  longer  in  Iraq  than  is  necessary.   I  know,  however,  that  some  of  you  feared  a  repeat  of  1991,  when  you  thought  Saddam's  rule   was  being  ended,  but  he  stayed,  and  you  suffered.  That  will  not  happen  this  time.  This  regime   will  be  gone,  and  ended.  And  then  we  will  work  with  you  to  build  the  peaceful,  prosperous  Iraq   that  you  want,  and  that  you  deserve.  And  this  Iraq  will  not  be  run  by  Britain,  or  by  the  United   States,  or  by  the  United  Nations.  It  will  be  run  by  you,  the  people  of  Iraq.    Our  aim  is  to  help  alleviate  immediate  humanitarian  suffering,  and  to  move  as  soon  as   possible  to  an  interim  authority  that  is  run  by  Iraqis.  That,  in  turn,  will  pave  the  way  for  a   truly  representative  Iraqi  government,  which  respects  human  rights  and  the  rule  of  law  and   spends  Iraq's  wealth  not  on  palaces  and  weapons  of  mass  destruction,  but  on  you  and  the   services  you  need.  Saddam  Hussein  and  his  regime  plundered  your  nation's  wealth.  While   many  of  you  live  in  poverty,  they  lived  lives  of  luxury.  Saddam  became  one  of  the  richest  men   in  the  world    his  money  stolen  from  you,  the  Iraqi  people.   The  money  from  Iraqi  oil  will  be  yours    to  be  used  to  build  prosperity  for  you  and  your   families.   I  know  too  from  my  meetings  with  Iraqi  exiles  who  live  in  Britain  that  you  are  an  inventive,   creative  people.  You  should  be  free  to  travel,  free  to  have  access  to  independent  media,  free   to  express  your  views,  free  to  develop  your  culture.   My  experience  of  people  the  world  over  is  that  we  all  want  to  be  able  to  live  our  lives  in  peace   and  security    we  all  want  to  give  our  families  the  chance  of  a  decent  life  and  a  future.  For   years,  that  chance  has  been  denied  to  you.  Millions  of  your  countrymen  and  women  have   been  forced  to  leave.  Many  thousands  have  been  murdered,  tortured,  brutalized  by  the   regime.  Now  we  want  to  give  you  the  chance  to  rebuild  your  country    to  rebuild  your  lives    to   give  your  families  a  chance  of  that  better  future.   So  it  is  in  the  spirit  of  friendship  and  goodwill  that  we  now  offer  our  help.   Thank  you.",bush
"Admiral Kelly, Captain Card, officers and sailors of the USS Abraham Lincoln, my fellow Americans: Major combat operations in Iraq have ended. In the battle of Iraq, the United States and our allies have prevailed. And now our coalition is engaged in securing and reconstructing that country. In this battle, we have fought for the cause of liberty, and for the peace of the world. Our nation and our coalition are proud of this accomplishment -- yet, it is you, the members of the United States military, who achieved it. Your courage, your willingness to face danger for your country and for each other, made this day possible. Because of you, our nation is more secure. Because of you, the tyrant has fallen, and Iraq is free. Operation Iraqi Freedom was carried out with a combination of precision and speed and boldness the enemy did not expect, and the world had not seen before. From distant bases or ships at sea, we sent planes and missiles that could destroy an enemy division, or strike a single bunker. Marines and soldiers charged to Baghdad across 350 miles of hostile ground, in one of the swiftest advances of heavy arms in history. You have shown the world the skill and the might of the American Armed Forces. This nation thanks all the members of our coalition who joined in a noble cause. We thank the Armed Forces of the United Kingdom, Australia, and Poland, who shared in the hardships of war. We thank all the citizens of Iraq who welcomed our troops and joined in the liberation of their own country. And tonight, I have a special word for Secretary Rumsfeld, for General Franks, and for all the men and women who wear the uniform of the United States: America is grateful for a job well done. The character of our military through history -- the daring of Normandy, the fierce courage of Iwo Jima, the decency and idealism that turned enemies into allies -- is fully present in this generation. When Iraqi civilians looked into the faces of our servicemen and women, they saw strength and kindness and goodwill. When I look at the members of the United States military, I see the best of our country, and I'm honored to be your Commander-in-Chief. In the images of falling statues, we have witnessed the arrival of a new era. For a hundred of years of war, culminating in the nuclear age, military technology was designed and deployed to inflict casualties on an ever-growing scale. In defeating Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, Allied forces destroyed entire cities, while enemy leaders who started the conflict were safe until the final days. Military power was used to end a regime by breaking a nation. Today, we have the greater power to free a nation by breaking a dangerous and aggressive regime. With new tactics and precision weapons, we can achieve military objectives without directing violence against civilians. No device of man can remove the tragedy from war; yet it is a great moral advance when the guilty have far more to fear from war than the innocent. In the images of celebrating Iraqis, we have also seen the ageless appeal of human freedom. Decades of lies and intimidation could not make the Iraqi people love their oppressors or desire their own enslavement. Men and women in every culture need liberty like they need food and water and air. Everywhere that freedom arrives, humanity rejoices; and everywhere that freedom stirs, let tyrants fear. We have difficult work to do in Iraq. We're bringing order to parts of that country that remain dangerous. We're pursuing and finding leaders of the old regime, who will be held to account for their crimes. We've begun the search for hidden chemical and biological weapons and already know of hundreds of sites that will be investigated. We're helping to rebuild Iraq, where the dictator built palaces for himself, instead of hospitals and schools. And we will stand with the new leaders of Iraq as they establish a government of, by, and for the Iraqi people. The transition from dictatorship to democracy will take time, but it is worth every effort. Our coalition will stay until our work is done. Then we will leave, and we will leave behind a free Iraq. The battle of Iraq is one victory in a war on terror that began on September the 11, 2001 -- and still goes on. That terrible morning, 19 evil men -- the shock troops of a hateful ideology - - gave America and the civilized world a glimpse of their ambitions. They imagined, in the words of one terrorist, that September the 11th would be the ""beginning of the end of America."" By seeking to turn our cities into killing fields, terrorists and their allies believed that they could destroy this nation's resolve, and force our retreat from the world. They have failed. In the battle of Afghanistan, we destroyed the Taliban, many terrorists, and the camps where they trained. We continue to help the Afghan people lay roads, restore hospitals, and educate all of their children. Yet we also have dangerous work to complete. As I speak, a Special Operations task force, led by the 82nd Airborne, is on the trail of the terrorists and those who seek to undermine the free government of Afghanistan. America and our coalition will finish what we have begun. From Pakistan to the Philippines to the Horn of Africa, we are hunting down al Qaeda killers. Nineteen months ago, I pledged that the terrorists would not escape the patient justice of the United States. And as of tonight, nearly one-half of al Qaeda's senior operatives have been captured or killed. The liberation of Iraq is a crucial advance in the campaign against terror. We've removed an ally of al Qaeda, and cut off a source of terrorist funding. And this much is certain: No terrorist network will gain weapons of mass destruction from the Iraqi regime, because the regime is no more. In these 19 months that changed the world, our actions have been focused and deliberate and proportionate to the offense. We have not forgotten the victims of September the 11th -- the last phone calls, the cold murder of children, the searches in the rubble. With those attacks, the terrorists and their supporters declared war on the United States. And war is what they got. Our war against terror is proceeding according to principles that I have made clear to all: Any person involved in committing or planning terrorist attacks against the American people becomes an enemy of this country, and a target of American justice. Any person, organization, or government that supports, protects, or harbors terrorists is complicit in the murder of the innocent, and equally guilty of terrorist crimes. Any outlaw regime that has ties to terrorist groups and seeks or possesses weapons of mass destruction is a grave danger to the civilized world -- and will be confronted. And anyone in the world, including the Arab world, who works and sacrifices for freedom has a loyal friend in the United States of America. Our commitment to liberty is America's tradition -- declared at our founding; affirmed in Franklin Roosevelt's Four Freedoms; asserted in the Truman Doctrine and in Ronald Reagan's challenge to an evil empire. We are committed to freedom in Afghanistan, in Iraq, and in a peaceful Palestine. The advance of freedom is the surest strategy to undermine the appeal of terror in the world. Where freedom takes hold, hatred gives way to hope. When freedom takes hold, men and women turn to the peaceful pursuit of a better life. American values and American interests lead in the same direction: We stand for human liberty. The United States upholds these principles of security and freedom in many ways -- with all the tools of diplomacy, law enforcement, intelligence, and finance. We're working with a broad coalition of nations that understand the threat and our shared responsibility to meet it. The use of force has been -- and remains -- our last resort. Yet all can know, friend and foe alike, that our nation has a mission: We will answer threats to our security, and we will defend the peace. Our mission continues. Al Qaeda is wounded, not destroyed. The scattered cells of the terrorist network still operate in many nations, and we know from daily intelligence that they continue to plot against free people. The proliferation of deadly weapons remains a serious danger. The enemies of freedom are not idle, and neither are we. Our government has taken unprecedented measures to defend the homeland. And we will continue to hunt down the enemy before he can strike. The war on terror is not over; yet it is not endless. We do not know the day of final victory, but we have seen the turning of the tide. No act of the terrorists will change our purpose, or weaken our resolve, or alter their fate. Their cause is lost. Free nations will press on to victory. Other nations in history have fought in foreign lands and remained to occupy and exploit. Americans, following a battle, want nothing more than to return home. And that is your direction tonight. After service in the Afghan -- and Iraqi theaters of war -- after 100,000 miles, on the longest carrier deployment in recent history, you are homeward bound. Some of you will see new family members for the first time -- 150 babies were born while their fathers were on the Lincoln. Your families are proud of you, and your nation will welcome you. We are mindful, as well, that some good men and women are not making the journey home. One of those who fell, Corporal Jason Mileo, spoke to his parents five days before his death. Jason's father said, ""He called us from the center of Baghdad, not to brag, but to tell us he loved us. Our son was a soldier."" Every name, every life is a loss to our military, to our nation, and to the loved ones who grieve. There's no homecoming for these families. Yet we pray, in God's time, their reunion will come. Those we lost were last seen on duty. Their final act on this Earth was to fight a great evil and bring liberty to others. All of you -- all in this generation of our military -- have taken up the highest calling of history. You're defending your country, and protecting the innocent from harm. And wherever you go, you carry a message of hope -- a message that is ancient and ever new. In the words of the prophet Isaiah, ""To the captives, 'come out,' -- and to those in darkness, 'be free.'"" Thank you for serving our country and our cause. May God bless you all, and may God continue to bless America.",bush
"Mr. Secretary General; Mr. President; distinguished delegates; ladies and gentlemen: Twenty- four months ago -- and yesterday in the memory of America -- the center of New York City became a battlefield, and a graveyard, and the symbol of an unfinished war. Since that day, terrorists have struck in Bali, Mombassa, in Casablanca, in Riyadh, in Jakarta, in Jerusalem --measuring the advance of their cause in the chaos and innocent suffering they leave behind. Last month, terrorists brought their war to the United Nations itself. The U.N. headquarters in Baghdad stood for order and compassion -- and for that reason, the terrorists decided it must be destroyed. Among the 22 people who were murdered was Sergio Vieira de Mello. Over the decades, this good and brave man from Brazil gave help to the afflicted in Bangladesh, Cyprus, Mozambique, Lebanon, Cambodia, Central Africa, Kosovo, and East Timor, and was aiding the people of Iraq in their time of need. America joins you, his colleagues, in honoring the memory of Senor Vieira de Mello, and the memory of all who died with him in the serviceto the United Nations. By the victims they choose, and by the means they use, the terrorists have clarified the struggle we are in. Those who target relief workers for death have set themselves against all humanity. Those who incite murder and celebrate suicide reveal their contempt for life, itself. They have no place in any religious faith; they have no claim on the world's sympathy; andthey should have no friend in this chamber. Events during the past two years have set before us the clearest of divides: between those who seek order, and those who spread chaos; between those who work for peaceful change, and those who adopt the methods of gangsters; between those who honor the rights of man, and those who deliberately take the lives of men and women and children without mercy orshame. Between these alternatives there is no neutral ground. All governments that support terror are complicit in a war against civilization. No government should ignore the threat of terror, because to look the other way gives terrorists the chance to regroup and recruit and prepare. And all nations that fight terror, as if the lives of their own people depend on it, will earn thefavorable judgment of history. The former regimes of Afghanistan and Iraq knew these alternatives, and made their choices. The Taliban was a sponsor and servant of terrorism. When confronted, that regime chose defiance, and that regime is no more. Afghanistan's President, who is here today, now represents a free people who are building a decent and just society; they're building a nationfully joined in the war against terror. The regime of Saddam Hussein cultivated ties to terror while it built weapons of mass destruction. It used those weapons in acts of mass murder, and refused to account for them when confronted by the world. The Security Council was right to be alarmed. The Security Council was right to demand that Iraq destroy its illegal weapons and prove that it had done so. The Security Council was right to vow serious consequences if Iraq refused to comply. And because there were consequences, because a coalition of nations acted to defend the peace, and the credibility of the United Nations, Iraq is free, and today we are joined byrepresentatives of a liberated country. Saddam Hussein's monuments have been removed and not only his statues. The true monuments of his rule and his character -- the torture chambers, and the rape rooms, and the prison cells for innocent children -- are closed. And as we discover the killing fields and massgraves of Iraq, the true scale of Saddam's cruelty is being revealed. The Iraqi people are meeting hardships and challenges, like every nation that has set out on the path of democracy. Yet their future promises lives of dignity and freedom, and that is a world away from the squalid, vicious tyranny they have known. Across Iraq, life is being improved by liberty. Across the Middle East, people are safer because an unstable aggressor has been removed from power. Across the world, nations are more secure because an ally ofterror has fallen. Our actions in Afghanistan and Iraq were supported by many governments, and America is grateful to each one. I also recognize that some of the sovereign nations of this assembly disagreed with our actions. Yet there was, and there remains, unity among us on the fundamental principles and objectives of the United Nations. We are dedicated to the defense of our collective security, and to the advance of human rights. These permanent commitmentscall us to great work in the world, work we must do together. So let us move forward. First, we must stand with the people of Afghanistan and Iraq as they build free and stable countries. The terrorists and their allies fear and fight this progress above all, because freepeople embrace hope over resentment, and choose peace over violence. The United Nations has been a friend of the Afghan people, distributing food and medicine, helping refugees return home, advising on a new constitution, and helping to prepare the way for nationwide elections. NATO has taken over the U.N.-mandated security force in Kabul. American and coalition forces continue to track and defeat al Qaeda terrorists and remnants of the Taliban. Our efforts to rebuild that country go on. I have recently proposed to spend an additional $1.2 billion for the Afghan reconstruction effort, and I urge other nations tocontinue contributing to this important cause. In the nation of Iraq, the United Nations is carrying out vital and effective work every day. By the end of 2004, more than 90 percent of Iraqi children under age five will have been immunized against preventable diseases such as polio, tuberculosis and measles, thanks to the hard work and high ideals of UNICEF. Iraq's food distribution system is operational, delivering nearly a half-million tons of food permonth, thanks to the skill and expertise of the World Food Program. Our international coalition in Iraq is meeting it responsibilities. We are conducting precision raids against terrorists and holdouts of the former regime. These killers are at war with the Iraqi people. They have made Iraq the central front in the war on terror, and they will be defeated. Our coalition has made sure that Iraq's former dictator will never again use weapons of mass destruction. We are interviewing Iraqi citizens and analyzing records of the old regime to reveal the full extent of its weapons programs and its long campaign of deception. We're training Iraqi police and border guards and a new army, so the Iraqi peoplecan assume full responsibility for their own security. And at the same time, our coalition is helping to improve the daily lives of the Iraqi people. The old regime built palaces while letting schools decay, so we are rebuilding more than a thousand schools. The old regime starved hospitals of resources, so we have helped to supply and reopen hospitals across Iraq. The old regime built up armies and weapons, while allowing the nation's infrastructure to crumble, so we are rehabilitating power plants, water and sanitation facilities, bridges and airports. I proposed to Congress that the United States provide additional funding for our work in Iraq, the greatest financial commitment of its kind since the Marshall Plan. Having helped to liberate Iraq, we will honor our pledges to Iraq, and by helping the Iraqi people build a stable and peaceful country, we will make our owncountries more secure. The primary goal of our coalition in Iraq is self-government for the people of Iraq, reached by orderly and democratic process. This process must unfold according to the needs of Iraqis, neither hurried, nor delayed by the wishes of other parties. And the United Nations can contribute greatly to the cause of Iraq self-government. America is working with friends and allies on a new Security Council resolution, which will expand the U.N.'s role in Iraq. As in the aftermath of other conflicts, the United Nations should assist in developing a constitution, intraining civil servants, and conducting free and fair elections. Iraq now has a Governing Council, the first truly representative institution in that country. Iraq's new leaders are showing the openness and tolerance that democracy requires, and they're also showing courage. Yet every young democracy needs the help of friends. Now the nation of Iraq needs anddeserves our aid, and all nations of goodwill should step forward and provide that support. The success of a free Iraq will be watched and noted throughout the region. Millions will see that freedom, equality, and material progress are possible at the heart of the Middle East. Leaders in the region will face the clearest evidence that free institutions and open societies are the only path to long-term national success and dignity. And a transformed Middle East would benefit the entire world, by undermining the ideologies that export violence to otherlands. Iraq as a dictatorship had great power to destabilize the Middle East; Iraq as a democracy will have great power to inspire the Middle East. The advance of democratic institutions in Iraq is setting an example that others, including the Palestinian people, would be wise to follow. The Palestinian cause is betrayed by leaders who cling to power by feeding old hatreds and destroying the good work of others. The Palestinian people deserve their own state, and they will gain that state by embracing new leaders committed to reform, to fighting terror, and to building peace. All parties in the Middle East must meet their responsibilities and carry out the commitments they made at Aqaba. Israel must work to create the conditions that will allow a peaceful Palestinian state to emerge. And Arab nations must cut off funding and other support for terrorist organizations. America will work with every nation in the region that acts boldlyfor the sake of peace. A second challenge we must confront together is the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Outlaw regimes that possess nuclear, chemical and biological weapons -- and the means to deliver them -- would be able to use blackmail and create chaos in entire regions. These weapons could be used by terrorists to bring sudden disaster and suffering on a scale we can scarcely imagine. The deadly combination of outlaw regimes and terror networks and weapons of mass murder is a peril that cannot be ignored or wished away. If such a danger is allowed to fully materialize, all words, all protests, will come too late. Nations of the worldmust have the wisdom and the will to stop grave threats before they arrive. One crucial step is to secure the most dangerous materials at their source. For more than a decade, the United States has worked with Russia and other states of the former Soviet Union to dismantle, destroy, or secure weapons and dangerous materials left over from another era. Last year in Canada, the G8 nations agreed to provide up to $20 billion -- half of it from the United States -- to fight this proliferation risk over the next 10 years. Since then, six additional countries have joined the effort. More are needed, and I urge other nations to helpus meet this danger. We're also improving our capability to interdict lethal materials in transit. Through our Proliferation Security Initiative, 11 nations are preparing to search planes and ships, trains and trucks carrying suspect cargo, and to seize weapons or missile shipments that raise proliferation concerns. These nations have agreed on a set of interdiction principles, consistent with legal -- current legal authorities. And we're working to expand the Proliferation Security Initiative to other countries. We're determined to keep the world's most destructive weaponsaway from all our shores, and out of the hands of our common enemies. Because proliferators will use any route or channel that is open to them, we need the broadest possible cooperation to stop them. Today, I ask the U.N. Security Council to adopt a new anti- proliferation resolution. This resolution should call on all members of the U.N. to criminalize the proliferation of weapons -- weapons of mass destruction, to enact strict export controls consistent with international standards, and to secure any and all sensitive materials within their own borders. The United States stands ready to help any nation draft these new laws,and to assist in their enforcement. A third challenge we share is a challenge to our conscience. We must act decisively to meet the humanitarian crises of our time. The United States has begun to carry out the Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, aimed at preventing AIDS on a massive scale, and treating millions who have the disease already. We have pledged $15 billion over five years to fight AIDS aroundthe world. My country is acting to save lives from famine, as well. We're providing more than $1.4 billion in global emergency food aid, and I've asked our United States Congress for $200 million for a new famine fund, so we can act quickly when the first signs of famine appear. Every nation on every continent should generously add their resources to the fight against disease anddesperate hunger. There's another humanitarian crisis spreading, yet hidden from view. Each year, an estimated 800,000 to 900,000 human beings are bought, sold or forced across the world's borders. Among them are hundreds of thousands of teenage girls, and others as young as five, who fall victim to the sex trade. This commerce in human life generates billions of dollars each year --much of which is used to finance organized crime. There's a special evil in the abuse and exploitation of the most innocent and vulnerable. The victims of sex trade see little of life before they see the very worst of life -- an underground of brutality and lonely fear. Those who create these victims and profit from their suffering must be severely punished. Those who patronize this industry debase themselves and deepen themisery of others. And governments that tolerate this trade are tolerating a form of slavery. This problem has appeared in my own country, and we are working to stop it. The PROTECT Act, which I signed into law this year, makes it a crime for any person to enter the United States, or for any citizen to travel abroad, for the purpose of sex tourism involving children. The Department of Justice is actively investigating sex tour operators and patrons, who can face up to 30 years in prison. Under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, the United States isusing sanctions against governments to discourage human trafficking. The victims of this industry also need help from members of the United Nations. And this begins with clear standards and the certainty of punishment under laws of every country. Today, some nations make it a crime to sexually abuse children abroad. Such conduct should be a crime in all nations. Governments should inform travelers of the harm this industry does, and the severe punishments that will fall on its patrons. The American government is committing $50 million to support the good work of organizations that are rescuing women and children from exploitation, and giving them shelter and medical treatment and the hopeof a new life. I urge other governments to do their part. We must show new energy in fighting back an old evil. Nearly two centuries after the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade, and more than a century after slavery was officially ended in its last strongholds, the trade in human beings for any purpose must not be allowed to thrivein our time. All the challenges I have spoken of this morning require urgent attention and moral clarity. Helping Afghanistan and Iraq to succeed as free nations in a transformed region, cutting off the avenues of proliferation, abolishing modern forms of slavery -- these are the kinds of great tasks for which the United Nations was founded. In each case, careful discussion is needed, and also decisive action. Our good intentions will be credited only if we achieve goodoutcomes. As an original signer of the U.N. Charter, the United States of America is committed to the United Nations. And we show that commitment by working to fulfill the U.N.'s stated purposes, and give meaning to its ideals. The founding documents of the United Nations and the founding documents of America stand in the same tradition. Both assert that human beings should never be reduced to objects of power or commerce, because their dignity is inherent. Both require -- both recognize a moral law that stands above men and nations, which must be defended and enforced by men and nations. And both point the way to peace, the peace that comes when all are free. We secure that peace with our courage, and we mustshow that courage together. May God bless you all.",bush
"Thank you all very much. Please be seated. Thanks for the warm welcome, and thanks forinviting me to join you in this 20th anniversary of the National Endowment for Democracy.The staff and directors of this organization have seen a lot of history over the last twodecades, you've been a part of that history. By speaking for and standing for freedom, you'velifted the hopes of people around the world, and you've brought great credit to America. I appreciate Vin for the short introduction. I'm a man who likes short introductions. And hedidn't let me down. But more importantly, I appreciate the invitation. I appreciate themembers of Congress who are here, senators from both political parties, members of theHouse of Representatives from both political parties. I appreciate the ambassadors who arehere. I appreciate the guests who have come. I appreciate the bipartisan spirit, thenonpartisan spirit of the National Endowment for Democracy. I'm glad that Republicans andDemocrats and independents are working together to advance human liberty. The roots of our democracy can be traced to England, and to its Parliament -- and so can theroots of this organization. In June of 1982, President Ronald Reagan spoke at WestminsterPalace and declared, the turning point had arrived in history. He argued that Sovietcommunism had failed, precisely because it did not respect its own people -- their creativity,their genius and their rights. President Reagan said that the day of Soviet tyranny was passing, that freedom had amomentum which would not be halted. He gave this organization its mandate: to add to themomentum of freedom across the world. Your mandate was important 20 years ago; it isequally important today. A number of critics were dismissive of that speech by the President. According to one editorialof the time, ""It seems hard to be a sophisticated European and also an admirer of RonaldReagan."" Some observers on both sides of the Atlantic pronounced the speech simplistic andnaive, and even dangerous. In fact, Ronald Reagan's words were courageous and optimisticand entirely correct. The great democratic movement President Reagan described was already well underway. Inthe early 1970s, there were about 40 democracies in the world. By the middle of that decade,Portugal and Spain and Greece held free elections. Soon there were new democracies in LatinAmerica, and free institutions were spreading in Korea, in Taiwan, and in East Asia. This veryweek in 1989, there were protests in East Berlin and in Leipzig. By the end of that year, everycommunist dictatorship in Central America* had collapsed. Within another year, the SouthAfrican government released Nelson Mandela. Four years later, he was elected president of hiscountry -- ascending, like Walesa and Havel, from prisoner of state to head of state. As the 20th century ended, there were around 120 democracies in the world -- and I canassure you more are on the way. Ronald Reagan would be pleased, and he would not besurprised. We've witnessed, in little over a generation, the swiftest advance of freedom in the 2,500 yearstory of democracy. Historians in the future will offer their own explanations for why thishappened. Yet we already know some of the reasons they will cite. It is no accident that therise of so many democracies took place in a time when the world's most influential nation wasitself a democracy. The United States made military and moral commitments in Europe and Asia, which protectedfree nations from aggression, and created the conditions in which new democracies couldflourish. As we provided security for whole nations, we also provided inspiration for oppressedpeoples. In prison camps, in banned union meetings, in clandestine churches, men andwomen knew that the whole world was not sharing their own nightmare. They knew of at leastone place -- a bright and hopeful land -- where freedom was valued and secure. And theyprayed that America would not forget them, or forget the mission to promote liberty aroundthe world. Historians will note that in many nations, the advance of markets and free enterprise helpedto create a middle class that was confident enough to demand their own rights. They will pointto the role of technology in frustrating censorship and central control -- and marvel at thepower of instant communications to spread the truth, the news, and courage across borders. Historians in the future will reflect on an extraordinary, undeniable fact: Over time, freenations grow stronger and dictatorships grow weaker. In the middle of the 20th century, someimagined that the central planning and social regimentation were a shortcut to nationalstrength. In fact, the prosperity, and social vitality and technological progress of a people aredirectly determined by extent of their liberty. Freedom honors and unleashes human creativity-- and creativity determines the strength and wealth of nations. Liberty is both the plan ofHeaven for humanity, and the best hope for progress here on Earth. The progress of liberty is a powerful trend. Yet, we also know that liberty, if not defended, canbe lost. The success of freedom is not determined by some dialectic of history. By definition,the success of freedom rests upon the choices and the courage of free peoples, and upon theirwillingness to sacrifice. In the trenches of World War I, through a two-front war in the 1940s,the difficult battles of Korea and Vietnam, and in missions of rescue and liberation on nearlyevery continent, Americans have amply displayed our willingness to sacrifice for liberty. The sacrifices of Americans have not always been recognized or appreciated, yet they havebeen worthwhile. Because we and our allies were steadfast, Germany and Japan aredemocratic nations that no longer threaten the world. A global nuclear standoff with theSoviet Union ended peacefully -- as did the Soviet Union. The nations of Europe are movingtowards unity, not dividing into armed camps and descending into genocide. Every nation haslearned, or should have learned, an important lesson: Freedom is worth fighting for, dying for,and standing for -- and the advance of freedom leads to peace. And now we must apply that lesson in our own time. We've reached another great turningpoint -- and the resolve we show will shape the next stage of the world democraticmovement. Our commitment to democracy is tested in countries like Cuba and Burma and North Koreaand Zimbabwe -- outposts of oppression in our world. The people in these nations live incaptivity, and fear and silence. Yet, these regimes cannot hold back freedom forever -- and,one day, from prison camps and prison cells, and from exile, the leaders of new democracieswill arrive. Communism, and militarism and rule by the capricious and corrupt are the relics ofa passing era. And we will stand with these oppressed peoples until the day of their freedomfinally arrives. Our commitment to democracy is tested in China. That nation now has a sliver, a fragment ofliberty. Yet, China's people will eventually want their liberty pure and whole. China hasdiscovered that economic freedom leads to national wealth. China's leaders will also discoverthat freedom is indivisible -- that social and religious freedom is also essential to nationalgreatness and national dignity. Eventually, men and women who are allowed to control theirown wealth will insist on controlling their own lives and their own country. Our commitment to democracy is also tested in the Middle East, which is my focus today, andmust be a focus of American policy for decades to come. In many nations of the Middle East --countries of great strategic importance -- democracy has not yet taken root. And thequestions arise: Are the peoples of the Middle East somehow beyond the reach of liberty? Aremillions of men and women and children condemned by history or culture to live indespotism? Are they alone never to know freedom, and never even to have a choice in thematter? I, for one, do not believe it. I believe every person has the ability and the right to befree. Some skeptics of democracy assert that the traditions of Islam are inhospitable to therepresentative government. This ""cultural condescension,"" as Ronald Reagan termed it, has along history. After the Japanese surrender in 1945, a so-called Japan expert asserted thatdemocracy in that former empire would ""never work."" Another observer declared theprospects for democracy in post-Hitler Germany are, and I quote, ""most uncertain at best"" --he made that claim in 1957. Seventy-four years ago, The Sunday London Times declarednine-tenths of the population of India to be ""illiterates not caring a fig for politics."" Yet whenIndian democracy was imperiled in the 1970s, the Indian people showed their commitment toliberty in a national referendum that saved their form of government. Time after time, observers have questioned whether this country, or that people, or thisgroup, are ""ready"" for democracy -- as if freedom were a prize you win for meeting our ownWestern standards of progress. In fact, the daily work of democracy itself is the path ofprogress. It teaches cooperation, the free exchange of ideas, and the peaceful resolution ofdifferences. As men and women are showing, from Bangladesh to Botswana, to Mongolia, it isthe practice of democracy that makes a nation ready for democracy, and every nation canstart on this path. It should be clear to all that Islam -- the faith of one-fifth of humanity -- is consistent withdemocratic rule. Democratic progress is found in many predominantly Muslim countries -- inTurkey and Indonesia, and Senegal and Albania, Niger and Sierra Leone. Muslim men andwomen are good citizens of India and South Africa, of the nations of Western Europe, and ofthe United States of America. More than half of all the Muslims in the world live in freedom under democratically constitutedgovernments. They succeed in democratic societies, not in spite of their faith, but because ofit. A religion that demands individual moral accountability, and encourages the encounter ofthe individual with God, is fully compatible with the rights and responsibilities of self- government. Yet there's a great challenge today in the Middle East. In the words of a recent report by Arabscholars, the global wave of democracy has -- and I quote -- ""barely reached the Arab states.""They continue: ""This freedom deficit undermines human development and is one of the mostpainful manifestations of lagging political development."" The freedom deficit they describe has terrible consequences, of the people of the Middle Eastand for the world. In many Middle Eastern countries, poverty is deep and it is spreading,women lack rights and are denied schooling. Whole societies remain stagnant while the worldmoves ahead. These are not the failures of a culture or a religion. These are the failures ofpolitical and economic doctrines. As the colonial era passed away, the Middle East saw the establishment of many militarydictatorships. Some rulers adopted the dogmas of socialism, seized total control of politicalparties and the media and universities. They allied themselves with the Soviet bloc and withinternational terrorism. Dictators in Iraq and Syria promised the restoration of national honor,a return to ancient glories. They've left instead a legacy of torture, oppression, misery, andruin. Other men, and groups of men, have gained influence in the Middle East and beyond throughan ideology of theocratic terror. Behind their language of religion is the ambition for absolutepolitical power. Ruling cabals like the Taliban show their version of religious piety in publicwhippings of women, ruthless suppression of any difference or dissent, and support forterrorists who arm and train to murder the innocent. The Taliban promised religious purity andnational pride. Instead, by systematically destroying a proud and working society, they leftbehind suffering and starvation. Many Middle Eastern governments now understand that military dictatorship and theocraticrule are a straight, smooth highway to nowhere. But some governments still cling to the oldhabits of central control. There are governments that still fear and repress independentthought and creativity, and private enterprise -- the human qualities that make for a -- strongand successful societies. Even when these nations have vast natural resources, they do notrespect or develop their greatest resources -- the talent and energy of men and womenworking and living in freedom. Instead of dwelling on past wrongs and blaming others, governments in the Middle East needto confront real problems, and serve the true interests of their nations. The good and capablepeople of the Middle East all deserve responsible leadership. For too long, many people in thatregion have been victims and subjects -- they deserve to be active citizens. Governments across the Middle East and North Africa are beginning to see the need forchange. Morocco has a diverse new parliament; King Mohammed has urged it to extend therights to women. Here is how His Majesty explained his reforms to parliament: ""How cansociety achieve progress while women, who represent half the nation, see their rights violatedand suffer as a result of injustice, violence, and marginalization, notwithstanding the dignityand justice granted to them by our glorious religion?"" The King of Morocco is correct: Thefuture of Muslim nations will be better for all with the full participation of women. In Bahrain last year, citizens elected their own parliament for the first time in nearly threedecades. Oman has extended the vote to all adult citizens; Qatar has a new constitution;Yemen has a multiparty political system; Kuwait has a directly elected national assembly; andJordan held historic elections this summer. Recent surveys in Arab nations reveal broadsupport for political pluralism, the rule of law, and free speech. These are the stirrings ofMiddle Eastern democracy, and they carry the promise of greater change to come. As changes come to the Middle Eastern region, those with power should ask themselves: Willthey be remembered for resisting reform, or for leading it? In Iran, the demand for democracyis strong and broad, as we saw last month when thousands gathered to welcome home ShirinEbadi, the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. The regime in Teheran must heed the democraticdemands of the Iranian people, or lose its last claim to legitimacy. For the Palestinian people, the only path to independence and dignity and progress is the pathof democracy. And the Palestinian leaders who block and undermine democratic reform, andfeed hatred and encourage violence are not leaders at all. They're the main obstacles topeace, and to the success of the Palestinian people. The Saudi government is taking first steps toward reform, including a plan for gradualintroduction of elections. By giving the Saudi people a greater role in their own society, theSaudi government can demonstrate true leadership in the region. The great and proud nation of Egypt has shown the way toward peace in the Middle East, andnow should show the way toward democracy in the Middle East. Champions of democracy inthe region understand that democracy is not perfect, it is not the path to utopia, but it's theonly path to national success and dignity. As we watch and encourage reforms in the region, we are mindful that modernization is notthe same as Westernization. Representative governments in the Middle East will reflect theirown cultures. They will not, and should not, look like us. Democratic nations may beconstitutional monarchies, federal republics, or parliamentary systems. And workingdemocracies always need time to develop -- as did our own. We've taken a 200-year journeytoward inclusion and justice -- and this makes us patient and understanding as other nationsare at different stages of this journey. There are, however, essential principles common to every successful society, in every culture.Successful societies limit the power of the state and the power of the military -- so thatgovernments respond to the will of the people, and not the will of an elite. Successful societiesprotect freedom with the consistent and impartial rule of law, instead of selecting applying --selectively applying the law to punish political opponents. Successful societies allow room forhealthy civic institutions -- for political parties and labor unions and independent newspapersand broadcast media. Successful societies guarantee religious liberty -- the right to serve andhonor God without fear of persecution. Successful societies privatize their economies, andsecure the rights of property. They prohibit and punish official corruption, and invest in the health and education of theirpeople. They recognize the rights of women. And instead of directing hatred and resentmentagainst others, successful societies appeal to the hopes of their own people. These vital principles are being applies in the nations of Afghanistan and Iraq. With the steadyleadership of President Karzai, the people of Afghanistan are building a modern and peacefulgovernment. Next month, 500 delegates will convene a national assembly in Kabul to approvea new Afghan constitution. The proposed draft would establish a bicameral parliament, setnational elections next year, and recognize Afghanistan's Muslim identity, while protecting therights of all citizens. Afghanistan faces continuing economic and security challenges -- it willface those challenges as a free and stable democracy. In Iraq, the Coalition Provisional Authority and the Iraqi Governing Council are also workingtogether to build a democracy -- and after three decades of tyranny, this work is not easy.The former dictator ruled by terror and treachery, and left deeply ingrained habits of fear anddistrust. Remnants of his regime, joined by foreign terrorists, continue their battle againstorder and against civilization. Our coalition is responding to recent attacks with precisionraids, guided by intelligence provided by the Iraqis, themselves. And we're working closelywith Iraqi citizens as they prepare a constitution, as they move toward free elections and takeincreasing responsibility for their own affairs. As in the defense of Greece in 1947, and later inthe Berlin Airlift, the strength and will of free peoples are now being tested before a watchingworld. And we will meet this test. Securing democracy in Iraq is the work of many hands. American and coalition forces aresacrificing for the peace of Iraq and for the security of free nations. Aid workers from manycountries are facing danger to help the Iraqi people. The National Endowment for Democracyis promoting women's rights, and training Iraqi journalists, and teaching the skills of politicalparticipation. Iraqis, themselves -- police and borders guards and local officials -- are joiningin the work and they are sharing in the sacrifice. This is a massive and difficult undertaking -- it is worth our effort, it is worth our sacrifice,because we know the stakes. The failure of Iraqi democracy would embolden terrorists aroundthe world, increase dangers to the American people, and extinguish the hopes of millions inthe region. Iraqi democracy will succeed -- and that success will send forth the news, fromDamascus to Teheran -- that freedom can be the future of every nation. The establishment ofa free Iraq at the heart of the Middle East will be a watershed event in the global democraticrevolution. Sixty years of Western nations excusing and accommodating the lack of freedom in the MiddleEast did nothing to make us safe -- because in the long run, stability cannot be purchased atthe expense of liberty. As long as the Middle East remains a place where freedom does notflourish, it will remain a place of stagnation, resentment, and violence ready for export. Andwith the spread of weapons that can bring catastrophic harm to our country and to ourfriends, it would be reckless to accept the status quo. Therefore, the United States has adopted a new policy, a forward strategy of freedom in theMiddle East. This strategy requires the same persistence and energy and idealism we haveshown before. And it will yield the same results. As in Europe, as in Asia, as in every region ofthe world, the advance of freedom leads to peace. The advance of freedom is the calling of our time; it is the calling of our country. From theFourteen Points to the Four Freedoms, to the Speech at Westminster, America has put ourpower at the service of principle. We believe that liberty is the design of nature; we believethat liberty is the direction of history. We believe that human fulfillment and excellence comein the responsible exercise of liberty. And we believe that freedom -- the freedom we prize --is not for us alone, it is the right and the capacity of all mankind. Working for the spread of freedom can be hard. Yet, America has accomplished hard tasksbefore. Our nation is strong; we're strong of heart. And we're not alone. Freedom is findingallies in every country; freedom finds allies in every culture. And as we meet the terror andviolence of the world, we can be certain the author of freedom is not indifferent to the fate offreedom. With all the tests and all the challenges of our age, this is, above all, the age of liberty. Eachof you at this Endowment is fully engaged in the great cause of liberty. And I thank you. May God bless your work. And may God continue to bless America.",bush
"Thank you very much. Secretary Straw and Secretary Hoon; Admiral Cobbald and Dr. Chipman; distinguished guests: I want to thank you for your very kind welcome that you've given to me and to Laura. I also thank the groups hosting this event -- The Royal United Services Institute, and the International Institute for Strategic Studies. We're honored to be in the United Kingdom, andwe bring the good wishes of the American people. It was pointed out to me that the last noted American to visit London stayed in a glass box dangling over the Thames. A few might have been happy to provide similar arrangements forme. I thank Her Majesty the Queen for interceding. We're honored to be staying at her house. Americans traveling to England always observe more similarities to our country than differences. I've been here only a short time, but I've noticed that the tradition of free speech -- exercised with enthusiasm -- is alive and well here in London. We have that at home, too.They now have that right in Baghdad, as well. The people of Great Britain also might see some familiar traits in Americans. We're sometimes faulted for a naive faith that liberty can change the world. If that's an error it began with reading too much John Locke and Adam Smith. Americans have, on occasion, been called moralists who often speak in terms of right and wrong. That zeal has been inspired by examples on this island, by the tireless compassion of Lord Shaftesbury, the righteous courage of Wilberforce, and the firm determination of the Royal Navy over the decades tofight and end the trade in slaves. It's rightly said that Americans are a religious people. That's, in part, because of the ""Good News"" was translated by Tyndale, preached by Wesley, lived out in the example of William Booth. At times, Americans are even said to have a puritan streak. And where might that havecome from? Well, we can start with the Puritans. To this fine heritage, Americans have added a few traits of our own: the good influence of our immigrants, the spirit of the frontier. Yet, there remains a bit of England in every American.So much of our national character comes from you, and we're glad for it. The fellowship of generations is the cause of common beliefs. We believe in open societies ordered by moral conviction. We believe in private markets, humanized by compassionate government. We believe in economies that reward effort, communities that protect the weak, and the duty of nations to respect the dignity and the rights of all. And whether one learns these ideals in County Durham or in West Texas, they instill mutual respect and they inspire common purpose. More than an alliance of security and commerce, the British and Americanpeoples have an alliance of values. And, today, this old and tested alliance is very strong. The deepest beliefs of our nations set the direction of our foreign policy. We value our own civil rights, so we stand for the human rights of others. We affirm the God-given dignity of every person, so we are moved to action by poverty and oppression and famine and disease. The United States and Great Britain share a mission in the world beyond the balance of power or the simple pursuit of interest. We seek the advance of freedom and the peace that freedom brings. Together our nations are standing and sacrificing for this high goal in a distant land at this very hour. And America honors the idealism and the bravery of the sons and daughters ofBritain. The last President to stay at Buckingham Palace was an idealist, without question. At a dinner hosted by King George V, in 1918, Woodrow Wilson made a pledge; with typical American understatement, he vowed that right and justice would become the predominant andcontrolling force in the world. President Wilson had come to Europe with his 14 Points for Peace. Many complimented him on his vision; yet some were dubious. Take, for example, the Prime Minister of France. Hecomplained that God, himself, had only 10 commandments. Sounds familiar. At Wilson's high point of idealism, however, Europe was one short generation from Munich and Auschwitz and the Blitz. Looking back, we see the reasons why. The League of Nations, lacking both credibility and will, collapsed at the first challenge of the dictators. Free nations failed to recognize, much less confront, the aggressive evil in plain sight. And so, dictators went about their business, feeding resentments and anti-Semitism, bringing death to innocent people in this city and across the world, and filling the last century with violence andgenocide. Through world war and cold war, we learned that idealism, if it is to do any good in this world, requires common purpose and national strength, moral courage and patience in difficult tasks.And now our generation has need of these qualities. On September the 11th, 2001, terrorists left their mark of murder on my country, and took the lives of 67 British citizens. With the passing of months and years, it is the natural human desire to resume a quiet life and to put that day behind us, as if waking from a dark dream. The hope that danger has passed is comforting, is understanding, and it is false. The attacks that followed -- on Bali, Jakarta, Casablanca, Bombay, Mombassa, Najaf, Jerusalem, Riyadh, Baghdad, and Istanbul -- were not dreams. They're part of a global campaign by terroristnetworks to intimidate and demoralize all who oppose them. These terrorists target the innocent, and they kill by the thousands. And they would, if they gain the weapons they seek, kill by the millions and not be finished. The greatest threat of our age is nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons in the hands of terrorists, and the dictators who aid them. The evil is in plain sight. The danger only increases with denial. Great responsibilities fall once again to the great democracies. We will face these threats with openeyes, and we will defeat them. The peace and security of free nations now rests on three pillars: First, international organizations must be equal to the challenges facing our world, from lifting up failing states toopposing proliferation. Like 11 Presidents before me, I believe in the international institutions and alliances that America helped to form and helps to lead. The United States and Great Britain have labored hard to help make the United Nations what it is supposed to be -- an effective instrument of our collective security. In recent months, we've sought and gained three additional resolutions on Iraq -- Resolutions 1441, 1483, and 1511 -- precisely because the global danger of terror demands a global response. The United Nations has no more compelling advocate than your Prime Minister, who at every turn has championed its ideals and appealed to its authority. He understands, as well, that the credibility of the U.N. depends on a willingness to keep its wordand to act when action is required. America and Great Britain have done, and will do, all in their power to prevent the United Nations from solemnly choosing its own irrelevance and inviting the fate of the League of Nations. It's not enough to meet the dangers of the world with resolutions; we must meetthose dangers with resolve. In this century, as in the last, nations can accomplish more together than apart. For 54 years, America has stood with our partners in NATO, the most effective multilateral institution in history. We're committed to this great democratic alliance, and we believe it must have thewill and the capacity to act beyond Europe where threats emerge. My nation welcomes the growing unity of Europe, and the world needs America and the European Union to work in common purpose for the advance of security and justice. America is cooperating with four other nations to meet the dangers posed by North Korea. Americabelieves the IAEA must be true to its purpose and hold Iran to its obligations. Our first choice, and our constant practice, is to work with other responsible governments. We understand, as well, that the success of multilateralism is not measured by adherence to forms alone -- the tidiness of the process -- but by the results we achieve to keep our nationssecure. The second pillar of peace and security in our world is the willingness of free nations, when the last resort arrives, to retain* [sic] aggression and evil by force. There are principled objections to the use of force in every generation, and I credit the good motives behind theseviews. Those in authority, however, are not judged only by good motivations. The people have given us the duty to defend them. And that duty sometimes requires the violent restraint of violent men. In some cases, the measured use of force is all that protects us from a chaotic worldruled by force. Most in the peaceful West have no living memory of that kind of world. Yet in some countries, the memories are recent: The victims of ethnic cleansing in the Balkans, those who survived the rapists and the death squads, have few qualms when NATO applied force to help end those crimes. The women of Afghanistan, imprisoned in their homes and beaten in the streets and executed in public spectacles, did not reproach us for routing the Taliban. The inhabitants of Iraq's Baathist hell, with its lavish palaces and its torture chambers, with its massive statutes** [sic] and its mass graves, do not miss their fugitive dictator. They rejoiced at hisfall. In all these cases, military action was proceeded by diplomatic initiatives and negotiations and ultimatums, and final chances until the final moment. In Iraq, year after year, the dictator was given the chance to account for his weapons programs, and end the nightmare for his people.Now, the resolutions he defied have been enforced. And who will say that Iraq was better off when Saddam Hussein was strutting and killing, or that the world was safer when he held power? Who doubts that Afghanistan is a more just society and less dangerous without Mullah Omar playing host to terrorists from around the world. And Europe, too, is plainly better off with Milosevic answering for his crimes, instead ofcommitting more. It's been said that those who live near a police station find it hard to believe in the triumph of violence. In the same way free peoples might be tempted to take for granted the orderly societies we have come to know. Europe's peaceful unity is one of the great achievements of the last half-century. And because European countries now resolve differences through negotiation and consensus, there's sometimes an assumption that the entire world functions in the same way. But let us never forget how Europe's unity was achieved -- by allied armies of liberation and NATO armies of defense. And let us never forget, beyond Europe's borders, in a world where oppression and violence are very real, liberation is still a moral goal, and freedom and securitystill need defenders. The third pillar of security is our commitment to the global expansion of democracy, and the hope and progress it brings, as the alternative to instability and hatred and terror. We cannot rely exclusively on military power to assure our long-term security. Lasting peace is gained asjustice and democracy advance. In democratic and successful societies, men and women do not swear allegiance to malcontents and murderers; they turn their hearts and labor to building better lives. And democratic governments do not shelter terrorist camps or attack their peaceful neighbors; they honor the aspirations and dignity of their own people. In our conflict with terror and tyranny, we have an unmatched advantage, a power that cannot be resisted, and that is theappeal of freedom to all mankind. As global powers, both our nations serve the cause of freedom in many ways, in many places. By promoting development, and fighting famine and AIDS and other diseases, we're fulfilling our moral duties, as well as encouraging stability and building a firmer basis for democratic institutions. By working for justice in Burma, in the Sudan and in Zimbabwe, we give hope to suffering people and improve the chances for stability and progress. By extending the reach of trade we foster prosperity and the habits of liberty. And by advancing freedom in the greater Middle East, we help end a cycle of dictatorship and radicalism that brings millions to [sic]people to misery and brings danger to our own people. The stakes in that region could not be higher. If the Middle East remains a place where freedom does not flourish, it will remain a place of stagnation and anger and violence for export. And as we saw in the ruins of two towers, no distance on the map will protect our lives and way of life. If the greater Middle East joins the democratic revolution that has reached much of the world, the lives of millions in that region will be bettered, and a trend of conflictand fear will be ended at its source. The movement of history will not come about quickly. Because of our own democratic development -- the fact that it was gradual and, at times, turbulent -- we must be patientwith others. And the Middle East countries have some distance to travel. Arab scholars speak of a freedom deficit that has separated whole nations from the progress of our time. The essentials of social and material progress -- limited government, equal justice under law, religious and economic liberty, political participation, free press, and respect for the rights of women -- have been scarce across the region. Yet that has begun to change. In an arc of reform from Morocco to Jordan to Qatar, we are seeing elections and new protections for women and the stirring of political pluralism. Many governments are realizing that theocracy and dictatorship do not lead to national greatness; they end in national ruin. They are finding, as others will find, that national progress and dignity are achieved whengovernments are just and people are free. The democratic progress we've seen in the Middle East was not imposed from abroad, and neither will the greater progress we hope to see. Freedom, by definition, must be chosen, and defended by those who choose it. Our part, as free nations, is to ally ourselves with reform,wherever it occurs. Perhaps the most helpful change we can make is to change in our own thinking. In the West, there's been a certain skepticism about the capacity or even the desire of Middle Eastern peoples for self-government. We're told that Islam is somehow inconsistent with a democratic culture. Yet more than half of the world's Muslims are today contributing citizens in democratic societies. It is suggested that the poor, in their daily struggles, care little for self- government. Yet the poor, especially, need the power of democracy to defend themselvesagainst corrupt elites. Peoples of the Middle East share a high civilization, a religion of personal responsibility, and a need for freedom as deep as our own. It is not realism to suppose that one-fifth of humanityis unsuited to liberty; it is pessimism and condescension, and we should have none of it. We must shake off decades of failed policy in the Middle East. Your nation and mine, in the past, have been willing to make a bargain, to tolerate oppression for the sake of stability. Longstanding ties often led us to overlook the faults of local elites. Yet this bargain did not bring stability or make us safe. It merely bought time, while problemsfestered and ideologies of violence took hold. As recent history has shown, we cannot turn a blind eye to oppression just because the oppression is not in our own backyard. No longer should we think tyranny is benign because it is temporarily convenient. Tyranny is never benign to its victims, and our great democraciesshould oppose tyranny wherever it is found. Now we're pursuing a different course, a forward strategy of freedom in the Middle East. We will consistently challenge the enemies of reform and confront the allies of terror. We will expect a higher standard from our friends in the region, and we will meet our responsibilitiesin Afghanistan and in Iraq by finishing the work of democracy we have begun. There were good-faith disagreements in your country and mine over the course and timing of military action in Iraq. Whatever has come before, we now have only two options: to keep our word, or to break our word. The failure of democracy in Iraq would throw its people back into misery and turn that country over to terrorists who wish to destroy us. Yet democracy will succeed in Iraq, because our will is firm, our word is good, and the Iraqi people will notsurrender their freedom. Since the liberation of Iraq, we have seen changes that could hardly have been imagined a year ago. A new Iraqi police force protects the people, instead of bullying them. More than 150 Iraqi newspapers are now in circulation, printing what they choose, not what they're ordered. Schools are open, with textbooks free of propaganda. Hospitals are functioning and are well-supplied. Iraq has a new currency, the first battalion of a new army, representative local governments, and a Governing Council with an aggressive timetable for national sovereignty. This is substantial progress. And much of it has proceeded faster than similarefforts in Germany and Japan after World War II. Yet the violence we are seeing in Iraq today is serious. And it comes from Baathist holdouts and Jihadists from other countries, and terrorists drawn to the prospect of innocent bloodshed. It is the nature of terrorism and the cruelty of a few to try to bring grief in the loss to many. The armed forces of both our countries have taken losses, felt deeply by our citizens. Some families now live with a burden of great sorrow. We cannot take the pain away. But these families can know they are not alone. We pray for their strength; we pray for theircomfort; and we will never forget the courage of the ones they loved. The terrorists have a purpose, a strategy to their cruelty. They view the rise of democracy in Iraq as a powerful threat to their ambitions. In this, they are correct. They believe their acts of terror against our coalition, against international aid workers and against innocent Iraqis,will make us recoil and retreat. In this, they are mistaken. We did not charge hundreds of miles into the heart of Iraq and pay a bitter cost of casualties, and liberate 25 million people, only to retreat before a band of thugs and assassins. We will help the Iraqi people establish a peaceful and democratic country in the heart of the MiddleEast. And by doing so, we will defend our people from danger. The forward strategy of freedom must also apply to the Arab-Israeli conflict. It's a difficult period in a part of the world that has known many. Yet, our commitment remains firm. We seek justice and dignity. We seek a viable, independent state for the Palestinian people, who have been betrayed by others for too long. We seek security and recognition for the state of Israel, which has lived in the shadow of random death for too long. These are worthy goals in themselves, and by reaching them we will also remove an occasion and excuse for hatred andviolence in the broader Middle East. Achieving peace in the Holy Land is not just a matter of the shape of a border. As we work on the details of peace, we must look to the heart of the matter, which is the need for a viable Palestinian democracy. Peace will not be achieved by Palestinian rulers who intimidate opposition, who tolerate and profit from corruption and maintain their ties to terrorist groups. These are the methods of the old elites, who time and again had put their own self-interest above the interest of the people they claim to serve. The long-suffering Palestinian people deserve better. They deserve true leaders, capable of creating and governing a Palestinianstate. Even after the setbacks and frustrations of recent months, goodwill and hard effort can bring about a Palestinian state and a secure Israel. Those who would lead a new Palestine should adopt peaceful means to achieve the rights of their people and create the reformedinstitutions of a stable democracy. Israel should freeze settlement construction, dismantle unauthorized outposts, end the daily humiliation of the Palestinian people, and not prejudice final negotiations with the placementsof walls and fences. Arab states should end incitement in their own media, cut off public and private funding forterrorism, and establish normal relations with Israel. Leaders in Europe should withdraw all favor and support from any Palestinian ruler who fails his people and betrays their cause. And Europe's leaders -- and all leaders -- should stronglyoppose anti-Semitism, which poisons public debates over the future of the Middle East. Ladies and gentlemen, we have great objectives before us that make our Atlantic alliance as vital as it has ever been. We will encourage the strength and effectiveness of international institutions. We will use force when necessary in the defense of freedom. And we will raise upan ideal of democracy in every part of the world. On these three pillars we will build the peace and security of all free nations in a time ofdanger. So much good has come from our alliance of conviction and might. So much now depends on the strength of this alliance as we go forward. America has always found strong partners in London, leaders of good judgment and blunt counsel and backbone when times are tough. And I have found all those qualities in your current Prime Minister, who has my respect andmy deepest thanks. The ties between our nations, however, are deeper than the relationship between leaders. These ties endure because they are formed by the experience and responsibilities and adversity we have shared. And in the memory of our peoples, there will always be one experience, one central event, when the seal was fixed on the friendship between Britain and the United States: The arrival in Great Britain of more than 1.5 million American soldiers and airmen in the 1940s was a turning point in the second world war. For many Britons, it was a first close look at Americans, other than in the movies. Some of you here today may still remember the ""friendly invasion."" Our lads, they took some getting used to. There was even asaying about what many of them were up to -- in addition to being ""overpaid and over here."" At a reunion in North London some years ago, an American pilot who had settled in England after his military service, said, ""Well, I'm still over here, and probably overpaid. So two out ofthree isn't bad."" In that time of war, the English people did get used to the Americans. They welcomed soldiers and fliers into their villages and homes, and took to calling them, ""our boys."" About 70,000 of those boys did their part to affirm our special relationship. They returned home with Englishbrides. Americans gained a certain image of Britain, as well. We saw an island threatened on every side, a leader who did not waver, and a country of the firmest character. And that has not changed. The British people are the sort of partners you want when serious work needs doin'. The men and women of this Kingdom are kind and steadfast and generous and brave. AndAmerica is fortunate to call this country our closest friend in the world. May God bless you all.",bush
"Good  afternoon.  Yesterday,  December  the  13th,  at  around  8:30  p.m.  Baghdad  time,  United   States  military  forces  captured  Saddam  Hussein  alive.  He  was  found  near  a  farmhouse  outside   the  city  of  Tikrit,  in  a  swift  raid  conducted  without  casualties.  And  now  the  former  dictator  of   Iraq  will  face  the  justice  he  denied  to  millions.   The  capture  of  this  man  was  crucial  to  the  rise  of  a  free  Iraq.   It  marks  the  end  of  the  road  for  him,  and  for  all  who  bullied  and  killed  in  his  name.  For  the   Baathist  holdouts  largely  responsible  for  the  current  violence,  there  will  be  no  return  to  the   corrupt  power  and  privilege  they  once  held.  For  the  vast  majority  of  Iraqi  citizens  who  wish  to   live  as  free  men  and  women,  this  event  brings  further  assurance  that  the  torture  chambers   and  the  secret  police  are  gone  forever.    And  this  afternoon,  I  have  a  message  for  the  Iraqi  people:  You  will  not  have  to  fear  the  rule  of   Saddam  Hussein  ever  again.  All  Iraqis  who  take  the  side  of  freedom  have  taken  the  winning   side.  The  goals  of  our  coalition  are  the  same  as  your  goals        sovereignty  for  your  country,   dignity  for  your  great  culture,  and  for  every  Iraqi  citizen,  the  opportunity  for  a  better  life.   In  the  history  of  Iraq,  a  dark  and  painful  era  is  over.  A  hopeful  day  has  arrived.  All  Iraqis  can   now  come  together  and  reject  violence  and  build  a  new  Iraq.   The  success  of  yesterday's  mission  is  a  tribute  to  our  men  and  women  now  serving  in  Iraq.   The  operation  was  based  on  the  superb  work  of  intelligence  analysts  who  found  the  dictator's   footprints  in  a  vast  country.  The  operation  was  carried  out  with  skill  and  precision  by  a  brave   fighting  force.  Our  servicemen  and  women  and  our  coalition  allies  have  faced  many  dangers  in   the  hunt  for  members  of  the  fallen  regime,  and  in  their  effort  to  bring  hope  and  freedom  to   the  Iraqi  people.  Their  work  continues,  and  so  do  the  risks.  Today,  on  behalf  of  the  nation,  I   thank  the  members  of  our  Armed  Forces  and  I  congratulate  'em.   I  also  have  a  message  for  all  Americans:  The  capture  of  Saddam  Hussein  does  not  mean  the   end  of  violence  in  Iraq.  We  still  face  terrorists  who  would  rather  go  on  killing  the  innocent  than   accept  the  rise  of  liberty  in  the  heart  of  the  Middle  East.  Such  men  are  a  direct  threat  to  the   American  people,  and  they  will  be  defeated.   We've  come  to  this  moment  through  patience  and  resolve  and  focused  action.  And  that  is  our   strategy  moving  forward.  The  war  on  terror  is  a  different  kind  of  war,  waged  capture  by   capture,  cell  by  cell,  and  victory  by  victory.  Our  security  is  assured  by  our  perseverance  and   by  our  sure  belief  in  the  success  of  liberty.  And  the  United  States  of  America  will  not  relent   until  this  war  is  won.   May  God  bless  the  people  of  Iraq,  and  may  God  bless  America.   Thank  you.",bush
"Good morning. Thank you all for coming. I take great joy in making this announcement. It's going to be one of the most important initiatives that my Administration not only discusses,but implements. First, it's good to have so many groups represented here -- religious and non-religious; Catholic, Jewish, Protestant, and Muslim; foundations and other non-profits. I want to thankyou all for coming. This is a collection of some of the finest America has got to offer -- people who lead with their hearts, and in turn, have changed the communities in which they live for the better. Thismeeting is a picture of the strength and diversity and compassion of our country. This is a diverse group, but we share things in common. We provide more than -- They provide more than practical help to people in need. They touch and change hearts. And forthis, America is deeply appreciative. Everyone in this room knows firsthand that there are still deep needs and real suffering in the shadow of America's affluence. Problems like addiction and abandonment and gang violence,domestic violence, mental illness and homelessness. We are called by conscience to respond. As I said in my Inaugural Address, ""compassion is the work of a nation, not just a government."" It is more than the calling of politicians; it is the calling of citizens. It is citizens who turn mean streets into good neighborhoods. It is citizens who turn cold cities into realcommunities. It is one of the great goals of my Administration to invigorate the spirit of involvement and citizenship. We will encourage faith-based and community programs without changing their mission. We will help all in their work to change hearts while keeping a commitment topluralism. I approach this goal with some basic principles: Government has important responsibilities for public health or public order and civil rights. Yet government -- And government will never be replaced by charities and community groups. Yet when we see social needs in America, my Administration will look first to faith-based programs and community groups, which have proven their power to save and change lives. We will not fund the religious activities of anygroup, but when people of faith provide social services, we will not discriminate against them. As long as there are secular alternatives, faith-based charities should be able to compete for funding on an equal basis, and in a manner that does not cause them to sacrifice their mission. And we will make sure that help goes to large organizations and to small ones as well. We value large organizations with generations of experience. We also valueneighborhood healers, who have only the scars and testimony of their own experience. Tomorrow I will begin turning these principles into a legislative agenda. I will send to Congress a series of ideas and proposals. Today, I want to raise the priority and profile of these issues within my own Administration. I want to ensure that faith-based and communitygroups will always have a place at the table in our deliberations. In a few moments, I will sign two executive orders. The first executive order will create a new office, called the White House Office of Faith-based and Community Initiatives. The head of this office will report directly to me and be charged with important responsibilities. He will oversee our initiatives on this issue. He will make sure our government, where it works with private groups, is fair and supportive. And he will highlight groups as national models soothers can learn from them. The second executive order will clear away the bureaucratic barriers in several important agencies that make private groups hesitate to work with government. It will establish centers in five agencies -- Justice, HUD, HHS, Labor and Education -- to ensure greater cooperation between the government and the independent sector. These centers will report back on regulatory barriers to working with non-profit groups, and make recommendations on howthose barriers can be removed. I have put this broad effort into the hands of two exceptional people -- first, Steve Goldsmith, known as one of the most innovative mayors in America, who pioneered ways to promote community efforts. He will continue to advise me on these issues. And I have asked Steve toserve on the board of the Corporation for National Service. This organization has done some good work in mobilizing volunteers of all ages. I've asked Steve to report to me on how we can make the corporation do better, and to get help whereit's most needed. And secondly, Professor John Dilulio will head the new office I am announcing today. He is one of the most influential social entrepreneurs in America. I can't tell you how honored I am for him to leave his post in academia to join us. He is the author of a respected textbook on American government. He has a servant's heart on the issues that we will confront. He's worked with disadvantaged children. He has been a major force in mobilizing the city of -- ofPhiladelphia to support faith-based and community groups. It's a fantastic team. I'm honored to have them on my team. I look forward to hearing from them, as well as I look forward to working with the people in this room and the social entrepreneurs all across America who have heard the universal call to love a neighbor like they'd like to be loved themselves; to exist and work hard, not out of the love of money, but out of the love of their fellow human beings. I'm absolutely convinced the great fabric of the nation exists in neighborhoods, amongst unsung heroes who do heroic acts on a daily and hourly basis. It's the fabric of the country that makes America unique. It is -- The power of promise that makes the future so promisingis the power of the missions that stand behind me. This is an effort that will be an effort from, now the second week of my Administration to the last week of my Administration, because I'm confident that this initiative, when fully implemented, will help us realize the dream that America, its hopes, its promise, itsgreatness, will extend its reach throughout every single neighborhood, all across the land. And now it is my honor to sign the two executive orders.",bush
"Thank you all very much. I'm honored to join with President Clinton, President Bush, Senator Dole and other distinguished guests on this day of remembrance and celebration. And, General Kelley, here in the company of the generation that won the war, I proudly accept theWorld War II Memorial on behalf of the people of the United States of America. Raising up this Memorial took skill and vision and patience. Now the work is done, and it is a fitting tribute, open and expansive, like America; grand and enduring, like the achievements we honor. The years of World War II were a hard, heroic and gallant time in the life of our country. When it mattered most, an entire generation of Americans showed the finest qualities of our nation and of humanity. On this day, in their honor, we will raise the American flag overa monument that will stand as long as America itself. In the history books, the Second World War can appear as a series of crises and conflicts, following an inevitable course -- from Pearl Harbor to the Coast of Normandy to the deck of the Missouri. Yet, on the day the war began, and on many hard days that followed, theoutcome was far from certain. There was a time, in the years before the war, when many earnest and educated people believed that democracy was finished. Men who considered themselves learned and civilized came to believe that free institutions must give way to the severe doctrines and stern discipline of a regimented society. Ideas first whispered in the secret councils of a remote empire, or shouted in the beer halls of Munich, became mass movements. And those movements became armies. And those armies moved mercilessly forward -- until the world saw Hitler strutting in Paris, and U.S. Navy ships burning in their own port. Across the world,from a hiding place in Holland to prison camps of Luzon, the captives awaited their liberators. Those liberators would come, but the enterprise would require the commitment and effort of our entire nation. As World War II began, after a decade of economic depression, the United States was not a rich country. Far from being a great power, we had only the 17th largest army in the world. To fight and win on two fronts, Americans had to work and save and ration and sacrifice as never before. War production plants operated shifts around the clock. Across the country, families planted victory gardens -- 20 million of them, producing 40 percent of the nation's vegetables in backyards and on rooftops. Two out of every three citizens put money into war bonds. As Colonel Oveta Culp Hobby said, ""This was a people's war, andeveryone was in it."" As life changed in America, so did the way that Americans saw our own country and its place in the world. The bombs at Pearl Harbor destroyed the very idea that America could live in isolation from the plots of aggressive powers. The scenes of the concentration camps, the heaps of bodies and ghostly survivors, confirmed forever America's calling to oppose theideologies of death. As we defended our ideals, we began to see that America is stronger when those ideals are fully implemented. America gained strength because women labored for victory and factory jobs, cared for the wounded and wore the uniform, themselves. America gained strength because African Americans and Japanese Americans and others fought for their country, which wasn't always fair to them. In time, these contributions became expectations of equality, andthe advances for justice in post-war America made us a better country. With all our flaws, Americans at that time had never been more united. And together we began and completed the largest single task in our history. At the height of conflict, America would have ships on every ocean, and armies on five continents. And on the most crucial ofdays, would move the equivalent of a major city across the English Channel. And all these vast movements of men and armor were directed by one man who could not walk on his own strength. President Roosevelt brought his own advantages to the job. His resolve was stronger than the will of any dictator. His belief in democracy was absolute. He possessed a daring that kept the enemy guessing. He spoke to Americans with an optimism that lightened their task. And one of the saddest days of the war came just as it was ending, when the casualty notice in the morning paper began with the name, Franklin D. Roosevelt,Commander-in-Chief. Across the years, we still know his voice. And from his words, we know that he understood the character of the American people. Dictators and their generals had dismissed Americans as no match for a master race. FDR answered them. In one of his radio addresses, he said, ""We have been described as a nation of weaklings, playboys. Let them tell that to General McArthur and his men. Let them tell that to the boys in the flying fortresses. Let them tell thatto the Marines."" In all, more than 16 million Americans would put on the uniform of the soldier, the sailor, the airman, the Marine, the Coast Guardsman or the Merchant Mariner. They came from city streets and prairie towns, from public high schools and West Point. They were a modest bunch, and still are. The ranks were filled with men like Army Private Joe Sakato. In heavy fighting in France, he saw a good friend killed, and charged up a hill determined to shoot the ones who did it. Private Sakato ran straight into enemy fire, killing 12, wounding two, capturing four, and inspiring his whole unit to take the hill and destroy the enemy. Looking back on it 55 years later, Joe Sakato said, ""I'm not a hero. Nowadays they call what I did'road rage.'"" This man's conduct that day gained him the Medal of Honor, one of 464 awarded for actions in World War II. Americans in uniform served bravely, fought fiercely and kept their honor -- even under the worst of conditions. Yet they were not warriors by nature. All they wanted was to finish the job and make it home. One soldier in the 58th Armor Field Artillery was known to have the best-kept rifle in the unit. He told his buddies he had plans for that weapon after the war. He said, ""I want to take ithome, cover it in salt, hang it on a wall in my living room so I can watch it rust."" These were the modest sons of a peaceful country, and millions of us are very proud to call them Dad. They gave the best years of their lives to the greatest mission their country ever accepted. They faced the most extreme danger, which took some and spared others, for reasons only known to God. And wherever they advanced or touched ground, they are remembered for their goodness and their decency. A Polish man recalls being marched through the German countryside in the last weeks of the war, when American forces suddenly appeared. He said, ""Our two guards ran away. And this soldier with little blonde hair jumps off his tank. 'You're free,' he shouts at us. We started hugging each other, crying and screaming,'God sent angels down to pick us up out of this hell place.'"" Well, our boys weren't exactly angels. They were flesh and blood, with all the limits and fears of flesh and blood. That only makes the achievement more remarkable -- the courage they showed, in a conflict that claimed more than 400,000 American lives, leaving so manyorphans and widows and Gold Star Mothers. The soldiers' story was best told by the great Ernie Pyle, who shared their lives and died among them. In his book, ""Here Is Your War,"" he described World War II as many veterans now remember it. It is a picture, he wrote, ""of tired and dirty soldiers, who are alive and don't want to die; of long, darkened convoys in the middle of the night; of shocked, silent men wandering back down the hill from battle; of Jeeps and petrol dumps and smelly bedding roles and C-rations; and blown bridges and dead mules and hospital tents and shirt collars greasy- black from months of wearing; and of laughter, too, and anger, and wine, and lovely flowersand constant cussing. All these, it is composed of; and of graves and graves and graves."" On this Memorial Day weekend, the graves will be visited, and decorated with flowers and flags. Men whose step has slowed are thinking of boys they knew when they were boys together. And women who watched the train leave, and the years pass, can still see thehandsome face of their young sweetheart. America will not forget them, either. At this place, at this Memorial, we acknowledge a debt of long-standing to an entire generation of Americans: those who died; those who fought and worked and grieved and went on. They saved our country, and thereby saved the liberty of mankind. And now I ask every man and woman who saw and lived World War II -- every member of that generation -- toplease rise as you are able, and receive the thanks of our great nation. May God bless you.",bush
"This is a sad hour in the life of America. A great American life has come to an end. I have just spoken to Nancy Reagan. On behalf of our whole nation, Laura and I offered her and the Reagan family our prayers and ourcondolences. Ronald Reagan won America's respect with his greatness, and won its love with his goodness. He had the confidence that comes with conviction, the strength that comes with character, the grace that comes with humility, and the humor that comes with wisdom. He leaves behind anation he restored and a world he helped save. During the years of President Reagan, America laid to rest an era of division and self-doubt. And because of his leadership, the world laid to rest an era of fear and tyranny. Now, in layingour leader to rest, we say thank you. He always told us that for America, the best was yet to come. We comfort ourselves in theknowledge that this is true for him, too. His work is done, and now a shining city awaits him. May God bless Ronald Reagan.",bush
"We lost Ronald Reagan only days ago, but we have missed him for a long time. We have missed his kindly presence, that reassuring voice, and the happy ending we had wished for him. It has been ten years since he said his own farewell; yet it is still very sad and hard to lethim go. Ronald Reagan belongs to the ages now, but we preferred it when he belonged to us. In a life of good fortune, he valued above all the gracious gift of his wife, Nancy. During his career, Ronald Reagan passed through a thousand crowded places; but there was only oneperson, he said, who could make him lonely by just leaving the room. America honors you, Nancy, for the loyalty and love you gave this man on a wonderfuljourney, and to that journey's end. Today, our whole nation grieves with you and your family. When the sun sets tonight off the coast of California, and we lay to rest our 40th President, a great American story will close. The second son of Nell and Jack Reagan first knew the world as a place of open plains, quiet streets, gas-lit rooms, and carriages drawn by horse. If you could go back to the Dixon, Illinois of 1922, you'd find a boy of 11 reading adventure stories at the public library, or running with his brother, Neil, along Rock River, and coming home to a little house on Hennepin Avenue. That town was the kind of place you remember where you prayed side by side with your neighbors, and if things were going wrong for them, you prayedfor them, and knew they'd pray for you if things went wrong for you. The Reagan family would see its share of hardship, struggle and uncertainty. And out of that circumstance came a young man of steadiness, calm, and a cheerful confidence that life would bring good things. The qualities all of us have seen in Ronald Reagan were first spotted 70 and 80 years ago. As a lifeguard in Lowell Park, he was the protector keeping an eye out for trouble. As a sports announcer on the radio, he was the friendly voice that made you see the game as he did. As an actor, he was the handsome, all-American, good guy, which, in hiscase, required knowing his lines -- and being himself. Along the way, certain convictions were formed and fixed in the man. Ronald Reagan believed that everything happened for a reason, and that we should strive to know and do the will of God. He believed that the gentleman always does the kindest thing. He believed that people were basically good, and had the right to be free. He believed that bigotry and prejudice were the worst things a person could be guilty of. He believed in the Golden Rule and in the power of prayer. He believed that America was not just a place in the world, but the hope of theworld. And he believed in taking a break now and then, because, as he said, there's nothing betterfor the inside of a man than the outside of a horse. Ronald Reagan spent decades in the film industry and in politics, fields known, on occasion, to change a man. But not this man. From Dixon to Des Moines, to Hollywood to Sacramento, to Washington, D.C., all who met him remembered the same sincere, honest, upright fellow. Ronald Reagan's deepest beliefs never had much to do with fashion or convenience. His convictions were always politely stated, affably argued, and as firm and straight as thecolumns of this cathedral. There came a point in Ronald Reagan's film career when people started seeing a future beyond the movies. The actor, Robert Cummings, recalled one occasion. ""I was sitting around the set with all these people and we were listening to Ronnie, quite absorbed. I said, 'Ron, have you ever considered someday becoming President?' He said, 'President of what?' 'President of the United States,' I said. And he said, 'What's the matter, don't you like myacting either?'"" The clarity and intensity of Ronald Reagan's convictions led to speaking engagements around the country, and a new following he did not seek or expect. He often began his speeches by saying, ""I'm going to talk about controversial things."" And then he spoke of communist rulers as slavemasters, of a government in Washington that had far overstepped its proper limits, of a time for choosing that was drawing near. In the space of a few years, he took ideas and principles that were mainly found in journals and books, and turned them into a broad,hopeful movement ready to govern. As soon as Ronald Reagan became California's governor, observers saw a star in the West -- tanned, well-tailored, in command, and on his way. In the 1960s, his friend, Bill Buckley, wrote, ""Reagan is indisputably a part of America, and he may become a part of Americanhistory."" Ronald Reagan's moment arrived in 1980. He came out ahead of some very good men, including one from Plains, and one from Houston. What followed was one of the decisive decades of the century, as the convictions that shaped the President began to shape thetimes. He came to office with great hopes for America, and more than hopes -- like the President he had revered and once saw in person, Franklin Roosevelt, Ronald Reagan matched an optimistic temperament with bold, persistent action. President Reagan was optimistic about the great promise of economic reform, and he acted to restore the reward and spirit of enterprise. He was optimistic that a strong America could advance the peace, and he acted to build the strength that mission required. He was optimistic that liberty would thrive whereverit was planted, and he acted to defend liberty wherever it was threatened. And Ronald Reagan believed in the power of truth in the conduct of world affairs. When he saw evil camped across the horizon, he called that evil by its name. There were no doubters in the prisons and gulags, where dissidents spread the news, tapping to each other in code what the American President had dared to say. There were no doubters in the shipyards and churches and secret labor meetings, where brave men and women began to hear the creaking and rumbling of a collapsing empire. And there were no doubters among those who swung hammers at the hated wall as the first and hardest blow had been struck by President RonaldReagan. The ideology he opposed throughout his political life insisted that history was moved by impersonal ties and unalterable fates. Ronald Reagan believed instead in the courage andtriumph of free men. And we believe it, all the more, because we saw that courage in him. As he showed what a President should be, he also showed us what a man should be. Ronald Reagan carried himself, even in the most powerful office, with a decency and attention to small kindnesses that also defined a good life. He was a courtly, gentle and considerate man, never known to slight or embarrass others. Many people across the country cherish letters he wrote in his own hand -- to family members on important occasions; to old friends dealing with sickness and loss; to strangers with questions about his days in Hollywood. A boy oncewrote to him requesting federal assistance to help clean up his bedroom. The President replied that, ""unfortunately, funds are dangerously low."" He continued, ""I'm sure your mother was fully justified in proclaiming your room a disaster. Therefore, you are inan excellent position to launch another volunteer program in our nation. Congratulations."" Sure, our 40th President wore his title lightly, and it fit like a white Stetson. In the end, through his belief in our country and his love for our country, he became an enduring symbol of our country. We think of his steady stride, that tilt of a head and snap of a salute, the big- screen smile, and the glint in his Irish eyes when a story came to mind. We think of a man advancing in years with the sweetness and sincerity of a Scout saying the Pledge. We think of that grave expression that sometimes came over his face, the seriousness of a man angered by injustice -- and frightened by nothing. We know, as he always said, that America's best days are ahead of us, but with Ronald Reagan's passing, some very fine daysare behind us, and that is worth our tears. Americans saw death approach Ronald Reagan twice, in a moment of violence, and then in the years of departing light. He met both with courage and grace. In these trials, he showed howa man so enchanted by life can be at peace with life's end. And where does that strength come from? Where is that courage learned? It is the faith of a boy who read the Bible with his mom. It is the faith of a man lying in an operating room, who prayed for the one who shot him before he prayed for himself. It is the faith of a man with afearful illness, who waited on the Lord to call him home. Now, death has done all that death can do. And as Ronald Wilson Reagan goes his way, we are left with the joyful hope he shared. In his last years, he saw through a glass darkly. Nowhe sees his Savior face to face. And we look to that fine day when we will see him again, all weariness gone, clear of mind,strong and sure, and smiling again, and the sorrow of his parting gone forever. May God bless Ronald Reagan, and the country he loved.",bush
"Mr. Chairman! Mr. Chairman, delegates, fellow citizens: I'm honored by your support, and Iaccept your nomination for President of the United States. When I -- When I said those words four years ago, none of us could have envisioned whatthese years would bring. In the heart of this great city, we saw tragedy arrive on a quietmorning. We saw the bravery of rescuers grow with danger. We learned of passengers on adoomed plane who died with a courage that frightened their killers. We have seen a shakeneconomy rise to its feet. And we have seen Americans in uniform storming mountainstrongholds, and charging through sandstorms, and liberating millions, with acts of valor thatwould make the men of Normandy proud. Since 2001, Americans have been given hills to climb, and found the strength to climb them.Now, because we have made the hard journey, we can see the valley below. Now, because wehave faced challenges with resolve, we have historic goals within our reach, and greatness inour future. We will build a safer world and a more hopeful America and nothing will hold usback. In the work we have done, and the work we will do, I am fortunate to have a superb VicePresident. I have counted on Dick Cheney's calm and steady judgment in difficult days, andI'm honored to have him at my side. I am grateful to share my walk in life with Laura Bush. Americans -- Americans have come tosee the goodness and kindness and strength I first saw 26 years ago, and we love our FirstLady. I'm a fortunate father of two spirited, intelligent, and lovely young women. I'm blessed with a sister and brothers who are my closest friends. And I will always be theproud and grateful son of George and Barbara Bush. My father served eight years at the side of another great American: Ronald Reagan. His -- Hisspirit of optimism and goodwill and decency are in this hall, and are in our hearts, and willalways define our Party. Two months from today, voters will make a choice based on the records we have built, theconvictions we hold, and the vision that guides us forward. A presidential election is a contestfor the future. Tonight I will tell you where I stand, what I believe, and where I will lead thiscountry in the next four years. I believe -- I believe every child can learn, and every school must teach, so we passed themost important federal education reform in history. Because we acted, children are makingsustained progress in reading and math, America's schools are getting better, and nothing willhold us back. I believe we have a moral responsibility to honor America's seniors, so I brought Republicansand Democrats together to strengthen Medicare. Now seniors are getting immediate helpbuying medicine. Soon every senior will be able to get prescription drug coverage, andnothing will hold us back. I believe in the energy and innovative spirit of America's workers, entrepreneurs, farmers, andranchers, so we unleashed that energy with the largest tax relief in a generation. Because weacted, our economy is growing again, and creating jobs, and nothing will hold us back. I believe the most solemn duty of the American president is to protect the American people. IfAmerica shows uncertainty or weakness in this decade, the world will drift toward tragedy.This will not happen on my watch. I'm running for President with a clear and positive plan to build a safer world, and a morehopeful America. I'm running with a compassionate conservative philosophy: that governmentshould help people improve their lives, not try to run their lives. I believe this Nation wantssteady, consistent, principled leadership and that is why, with your help, we will win thiselection. The story -- The story of America is the story of expanding liberty: an ever-widening circle,constantly growing to reach further and include more. Our Nation's founding commitment isstill our deepest commitment: In our world, and here at home, we will extend the frontiers offreedom. The times in which we live and work are changing dramatically. The workers of our parents'generation typically had one job, one skill, one career often with one company that providedhealth care and a pension. And most of those workers were men. Today, workers change jobs,even careers, many times during their lives, and in one of the most dramatic shifts our societyhas seen, two-thirds of all Moms also work outside the home. This changed world can be a time of great opportunity for all Americans to earn a betterliving, support your family, and have a rewarding career. And government must take yourside. Many of our most fundamental systems -- the tax code, health coverage, pension plans,worker training -- were created for the world of yesterday, not tomorrow. We will transformthese systems so that all citizens are equipped, prepared, and thus truly free to make yourown choices and pursue your own dreams. My plan begins with providing the security and opportunity of a growing economy. We nowcompete in a global market that provides new buyers for our goods, but new competition forour workers. To create more jobs in America, America must be the best place in the world todo business. To create jobs, my plan will encourage investment and expansion by restrainingfederal spending, reducing regulation, and making the tax relief permanent. To create jobs,we will make our country less dependent on foreign sources of energy. To create jobs, we willexpand trade and level the playing field to sell American goods and services across the globe.And we must protect small business owners and workers from the explosion of frivolouslawsuits that threaten jobs across our country. Another drag on our economy is the current tax code, which is a complicated mess filled withspecial interest loopholes, saddling our people with more than six billion hours of paperworkand headache every year. The American people deserve and our economic future demands asimpler, fairer, pro-growth system. In a new term, I will lead a bipartisan effort to reform andsimplify the federal tax code. Another priority in a new term will be to help workers take advantage of the expandingeconomy to find better and higher-paying jobs. In this time of change, many workers want togo back to school to learn different or higher-level skills. So we will double the number ofpeople served by our principal job training program and increase funding for our communitycolleges. I know that with the right skills, American workers can compete with anyone,anywhere in the world. In this time of change, opportunity in some communities is more distant than in others. Tostand with workers in poor communities and those that have lost manufacturing, textile, andother jobs we will create American opportunity zones. In these areas, we will provide tax reliefand other incentives to attract new business, and improve housing and job training to bringhope and work throughout all of America. As I've traveled the country, I've met many workers and small business owners who have toldme that they are worried they cannot afford health care. More than half of the uninsured aresmall business employees and their families. In a new term, we must allow small firms to jointogether to purchase insurance at the discounts available to big companies. We will offer a taxcredit to encourage small businesses and their employees to set up health savings accounts,and provide -- and provide direct help for low-income Americans to purchase them. Theseaccounts give workers the security of insurance against major illness, the opportunity to savetax-free for routine health expenses, and the freedom of knowing you can take your accountwith you whenever you change jobs. We will provide low-income Americans with better accessto health care: In a new term, I will ensure every poor county in America has a community orrural health center. As I've traveled our country, I've met too many good doctors, especially OBGYNS, who arebeing forced out of practice because of the high cost of lawsuits. To make health care moreaffordable and accessible, we must pass medical liability reform now. And in all we do toimprove health care in America, we will make sure that health decisions are made by doctorsand patients, not by bureaucrats in Washington, DC. In this time of change, government must take the side of working families. In a new term, wewill change outdated labor laws to offer comp-time and flex-time. Our laws should never standin the way of a more family-friendly workplace. Another priority for a new term is to build an ownership society, because ownership bringssecurity, and dignity, and independence. Thanks to our policies, homeownership in America isat an all-time high. Tonight we set a new goal: seven million more affordable homes in thenext 10 years so more American families will be able to open the door and say welcome to myhome. In an ownership society, more people will own their health care plans, and have theconfidence of owning a piece of their retirement. We'll always keep the promise of SocialSecurity for our older workers. With the huge Baby Boom generation approaching retirement,many of our children and grandchildren understandably worry whether Social Security will bethere when they need it. We must strengthen Social Security by allowing younger workers tosave some of their taxes in a personal -- personal account, a nest egg you can call your own,and government can never take away. In all these proposals, we seek to provide not just a government program, but a path -- apath to greater opportunity, more freedom, and more control over your own life. And the pathbegins with our youngest Americans. To build a more hopeful America, we must help ourchildren reach as far as their vision and character can take them. Tonight, I remind everyparent and every teacher, I say to every child: No matter what your circumstance, no matterwhere you live, your school will be the path to promise of America. We are transforming our schools by raising standards and focusing on results. We are insistingon accountability, empowering parents and teachers, and making sure that local people are incharge of their schools. By testing every child, we are identifying those who need help -- andwe are providing a record level of funding to get them that help. In northeast Georgia,Gainesville Elementary School is mostly Hispanic and 90 percent poor -- and this year 90percent of its students passed state tests in reading and math. The principal -- The principalexpresses the philosophy of his school this way: ""We don't focus on what we can't do at thisschool; we focus on what we can do. And we do whatever it takes to get kids across the finishline."" See, this principal is challenging the soft bigotry of low expectations, and that is thespirit of our education reform, and the commitment of our country: No dejaremos a ning  nni  o atr  s. ""We will leave no child behind."" We are making progress -- We are making and there is more to do. In this time of change,most new jobs are filled by people with at least two years of college, yet only about one infour students gets there. In our high schools, we will fund early intervention programs to helpstudents at risk. We will place a new focus on math and science. As we make progress, we willrequire a rigorous exam before graduation. By raising performance in our high schools, andexpanding Pell grants for low and middle income families, we will help more Americans starttheir career with a college diploma. America's children must also have a healthy start in life. In a new term, we will lead anaggressive effort to enroll millions of poor children who are eligible but not signed up for thegovernment's health insurance programs. We will not allow a lack of attention, or information,to stand between these children and the health care they need. Anyone who wants more details on my agenda can find 'em online. The web address is notvery imaginative, but it's easy to remember: GeorgeWBush.com. These changing times can be exciting times of expanded opportunity. And here, you face achoice. My opponent's policies are dramatically different from ours. Senator Kerry opposedMedicare reform and health savings accounts. After supporting my education reforms, he nowwants to dilute 'em. He opposes legal and medical liability reform. He opposed reducing themarriage penalty, opposed doubling the child credit, opposed lowering income taxes for allwho pay them. (Wait a minute. Wait a minute.) To be fair, there are some things myopponent is for. He's -- He's proposed more than two trillion dollars in federal spending so far,and that's a lot, even for a senator from Massachusetts. And to pay for that spending, he isrunnin' on a platform of increasing taxes, and that's the kind of promise a politician usuallykeeps. His tax and -- His policies of tax and spend, of expanding government rather than expandingopportunity are the politics of the past. We are on the path to the future and we're not turningback. In this world of change, some things do not change: the values we try to live by, theinstitutions that give our lives meaning and purpose. Our society rests on a foundation ofresponsibility and character and family commitment. Because family and work are sources of stability and dignity, I support welfare reform thatstrengthens family and requires work. Because a caring society will value its weakestmembers, we must make a place for the unborn child. Because -- Because religious charitiesprovide a safety net of mercy and compassion, our government must never discriminateagainst them. Because the union of a man and woman deserves an honored place in oursociety, I support the protection of marriage against activist judges. And I will continue toappoint federal judges who know the difference between personal opinion and the strictinterpretation of the law. My opponent recently announced that he's the conservative -- the candidate of ""conservativevalues."" Must have come as a surprise to a lot of his supporters. There are some problemswith this claim. If you say the heart and soul of America is found in Hollywood, I'm afraid youare not the candidate of conservative values. If -- If you voted against the bipartisan Defenseof Marriage Act, which President Clinton signed, you are not the candidate of conservativevalues. If you gave a speech, as my opponent did, calling the Reagan presidency eight yearsof ""moral darkness,"" then you may be a lot of things, but the candidate of conservative valuesis not one of them. This election will also determine how America responds to the continuing danger of terrorism.And you know where I stand. Three days after September the 11th, I stood where Americansdied, in the ruins of the Twin Towers. Workers in hard hats were shouting to me, ""Whatever ittakes."" A fellow grabbed me by the arm and he said, ""Do not let me down."" Since that day, Iwake up every morning thinking about how to better protect our country. I will never relent indefending America whatever it takes. So we have fought the terrorists across the earth not for pride, not for power, but because thelives of our citizens are at stake. Our strategy is clear. We've tripled funding for homelandsecurity and trained a half a million first responders, because we're determined to protect ourhomeland. We're transforming our military and reforming and strengthening our intelligenceservices. We are staying on the offensive, striking terrorists abroad, so we do not have to facethem here at home. And we are working to advance liberty in the broader Middle East,because freedom will bring a future of hope, and the peace we all want. And we will prevail. Our strategy is succeeding. Four years ago, Afghanistan was the home base of al-Qaida;Pakistan was a transit point for terrorist groups; Saudi Arabia was fertile ground for terroristfundraising; Libya was secretly pursuing nucular [nuclear] weapons; Iraq was a gatheringthreat; and al-Qaida was largely unchallenged as it planned attacks. Today, the government of -- of a free Afghanistan is fighting terror; Pakistan is capturingterrorist leaders; Saudi Arabia is making raids and arrests; Libya is dismantling its weaponsprograms; the army of a free Iraq is fighting for freedom; and more than three-quarters of al- Qaida's key members and associates have been detained or killed. We have led; many havejoined; and America and the world are safer. This progress involved careful diplomacy, clear moral purpose, and some tough decisions. Andthe toughest came on Iraq. We knew Saddam Hussein's record of aggression and support forterror. We knew his long history of pursuing, even using, weapons of mass destruction. Andwe know that September the 11th requires our country to think differently: We must, and wewill, confront threats to America before it is too late. In Saddam Hussein, we saw a threat. Members of both political parties, including --. Membersof both political parties, including my opponent and his running mate, saw the threat, andvoted to authorize the use of force. We went to the United Nations Security Council, whichpassed a unanimous resolution demanding the dictator disarm, or face serious consequences.Leaders in the Middle East urged him to comply. After more than a decade of diplomacy, wegave Saddam Hussein another chance, a final chance, to meet his responsibilities to thecivilized world. He again refused, and I faced the kind of decision that comes only to the OvalOffice, a decision no president would ask for, but must be prepared to make. Do I forget thelessons of September the 11th and take the word of a madman, or do I take action to defendour country? Faced with that choice, I will defend America every time. Because we acted to defend our country, the murderous regimes of Saddam Hussein and theTaliban are history, more than 50 million people have been liberated, and democracy iscoming to the broader Middle East. In Afghanistan, terrorists have done everything they canto intimidate people, yet more than 10 million citizens have registered to vote in the Octoberpresidential election -- a resounding endorsement for democracy. Despite ongoing acts ofviolence, Iraq now has a strong Prime Minister, a national council, and national elections arescheduled for January. Our Nation is standing with the people of Afghanistan and Iraq,because when America gives its word, America must keep its word. As importantly, we are serving a vital and historic cause that will make our country safer. Freesocieties in the Middle East will be hopeful societies, which no longer feed resentments andbreed violence for export. Free governments in the Middle East will fight terrorists instead ofharboring them, and that helps us keep the peace. So our mission in Afghanistan and Iraq is clear: We will help new leaders to train their armies,and move toward elections, and get on the path of stability and democracy as quickly aspossible. And then our troops will return home with the honor they have earned. Our troops know the historic importance of our work. One Army Specialist wrote home: ""Weare transforming a once sick society into a hopeful place. The various terrorist enemies weare facing in Iraq,"" he continued, ""are really aiming at you back in the United States. This is atest of will for our country. We soldiers of yours are doing great and scoring victories inconfronting the evil terrorists."" That young man is right -- our men and women in uniform aredoing a superb job for America. Tonight I want to speak to all of them and to their families: You are involved in a struggle ofhistoric proportion. Because of your service and sacrifice, we are defeating the terroristswhere they live and plan, and you're making America safer. Because of you, women inAfghanistan are no longer shot in a sports stadium. Because of you, the people of Iraq nolonger fear being executed and left in mass graves. Because of you, the world is more justand will be more peaceful. We owe you our thanks, and we owe you something more. We willgive you all the resources, all the tools, and all the support you need for victory. Again -- Again my opponent and I have different approaches. I proposed, and the Congressoverwhelmingly passed, 87 billion dollars in funding needed by our troops doing battle inAfghanistan and Iraq. My opponent and his running mate voted against this money for bullets,and fuel, and vehicles, and body armor. When asked to explain his vote, the Senator said, ""Iactually did vote for the 87 billion dollars before I voted against it."" Then he said -- Then hesaid he was ""proud"" of his vote. Then, when pressed, he said it was a ""complicated"" matter.There's nothing complicated about supporting our troops in combat. Our allies also know the historic importance of our work. About 40 nations stand beside us inAfghanistan, and some 30 in Iraq. I deeply appreciate the courage and wise counsel of leaderslike Prime Minister Howard, President Kwasniewski, Prime Minister Berlusconi and, of course,Prime Minister Tony Blair. Again, my opponent takes a different approach. In the midst of war, he has called Americanallies, quote, a ""coalition of the coerced and the bribed."" That would be nations like GreatBritain, Poland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Denmark, El Salvador, Australia, and others --allies that deserve the respect of all Americans, not the scorn of a politician. I respect every soldier, from every country, who serves beside us in the hard work of history.America is grateful, and America will not forget. The people we have freed won't forget either. Not long ago, seven Iraqi men came to see mein the Oval Office. They had ""X""s branded into their foreheads, and their right hands had beencut off by Saddam Hussein's secret police, the sadistic punishment for imaginary crimes.During our emotional visit one of the Iraqi men used his new prosthetic hand to slowly writeout, in Arabic, a prayer for God to bless America. I am proud that our country remains thehope of the oppressed, and the greatest force for good on this earth. Others understand the historic importance of our work. The terrorists know. They know that avibrant, successful democracy at the heart of the Middle East will discredit their radicalideology of hate. They know that men and women with hope and purpose and dignity do notstrap bombs on their bodies and kill the innocent. The terrorists are fighting freedom with alltheir cunning and cruelty because freedom is their greatest fear, and they should be afraid,because freedom is on the march. I believe in the transformational power of liberty: The wisest use of American strength is toadvance freedom. As the citizens of Afghanistan and Iraq seize the moment, their examplewill send a message of hope throughout a vital region. Palestinians will hear the message thatdemocracy and reform are within their reach, and so is peace with our good friend Israel.Young women across the Middle East will hear the message that their day of equality andjustice is coming. Young men will hear the message that national progress and dignity arefound in liberty, not tyranny and terror. Reformers and political prisoners and exiles will hearthe message that their dream of freedom cannot be denied forever. And as freedom advancesheart by heart, and nation by nation America will be more secure and the world morepeaceful. America has done this kind of work before and there have always been doubters. In 1946, 18months after the fall of Berlin to allied forces, a journalist in the New York Times wrote this: ""Germany is a land in an acute stage of economic, political and moral crisis. European capitalsare frightened. In every military headquarters, one meets alarmed officials doing their utmostto deal with the consequences of the occupation policy that they admit has failed."" End quote. Maybe that same person is still around, writing editorials. Fortunately, we had a resolutepresident named Truman, who, with the American people, persevered -- knowing that a newdemocracy at the center of Europe would lead to stability and peace. And because thatgeneration of Americans held firm in the cause of liberty, we live in a better and safer worldtoday. The progress we and our friends and allies seek in the broader Middle East will not comeeasily, or all at once. Yet Americans, of all people, should never be surprised by the power ofliberty to transform lives and nations. That power brought settlers on perilous journeys, inspired colonies to rebellion, ended the sinof slavery, and set our Nation against the tyrannies of the 20th century. We were honored toaid the rise of democracy in Germany and Japan, Nicaragua, Central Europe and the Baltics.And that noble story goes on. I believe that America is called to lead the cause of freedom in a new century. I believe that millions in the Middle East plead in silence for their liberty. I believe that given the chance, they will embrace the most honorable form of governmentever devised by man. I believe all these things because freedom is not America's gift to the world, it is the AlmightyGod's gift to every man and woman in this world. This moment in the life of our country will be remembered. Generations will know if we keptour faith and kept our word. Generations will know if we seized this moment and used it tobuild a future of safety and peace. The freedom of many, and the future security of ourNation, now depend on us. And tonight, my fellow Americans, I ask you to stand with me. In the last four years -- In the last four years, you and I have come to know each other. Evenwhen we don't agree, at least you know what I believe and where I stand. You may have noticed I have a few flaws, too. People sometimes have to correct my English. Iknew I had a problem when Arnold Schwarzenegger started doing it. Some folks look at meand see a certain swagger, which in Texas is called ""walking."" Now and then I come across asa little too blunt and for that we can all thank the white-haired lady sitting right up there. One thing I have learned about the presidency is that whatever shortcomings you have,people are going to notice them and whatever strengths you have, you're gonna need 'em.These four years have brought moments I could not foresee and will not forget. I've tried tocomfort Americans who lost the most on September the 11th -- people who showed me apicture or told me a story, so I'd -- I would know how much was taken from them. I'velearned first-hand that ordering Americans into battle is the hardest decision, even when it isright. I have returned the salute of wounded soldiers, some with a very tough road ahead,who say they were just doing their job. I've held the children of the fallen, who were told theirdad or mom is a hero, but would rather just have their mom or dad. I've met with the parents and wives and husbands who have received a folded flag, and said afinal goodbye to a soldier they loved. I am awed that so many have used those meetings tosay that I'm in their prayers -- and to offer encouragement to me. Where does that strengthlike that come from? How can people so burdened with sorrow also feel such pride? It isbecause they know their loved one was last seen doing good. Because they know that libertywas precious to the one they lost. And in those military families, I have seen the character ofa great nation: decent, idealistic, and strong. The world saw that spirit three miles from here, when the people of this city faced periltogether, and lifted a flag over the ruins, and defied the enemy with their courage. My fellow Americans, for as long as our country stands, people will look to the resurrection ofNew York City and they will say: Here buildings fell; here a nation rose. We see America's character in our military, which finds a way or makes one. We see it in our veterans, who are supporting military families in their days of worry. We see it in our young people, who have found heroes once again. We see that character in workers and entrepreneurs, who are renewing our economy withtheir effort and optimism. And all of this has confirmed one belief beyond doubt: Having come this far, our tested andconfident Nation can achieve anything. To everything we know there is a season -- a time for sadness, a time for struggle, a time forrebuilding. And now we have reached a time for hope. This young century will be liberty's century. By promoting liberty abroad, we will build a saferworld. By encouraging liberty at home, we will build a more hopeful America. Like generationsbefore us, we have a calling from beyond the stars to stand for freedom. This is theeverlasting dream of America and tonight, in this place, that dream is renewed. Now we go forward grateful for our freedom, faithful to our cause, and confident in the futureof the greatest nation on earth. God bless you, and may God continue to bless our great country. Thank you all.",bush
"Thank you for the honor of addressing this General Assembly. The American people respectthe idealism that gave life to this organization. And we respect the men and women of the U.N., who stand for peace and human rights in every part of the world. Welcome to New YorkCity, and welcome to the United States of America. During the past three years, I've addressed this General Assembly in a time of tragedy for my country, and in times of decision for all of us. Now we gather at a time of tremendousopportunity for the U.N. and for all peaceful nations. For decades, the circle of liberty and security and development has been expanding in our world. This progress has brought unity to Europe, self-government to Latin America and Asia, and new hope to Africa. Now we havethe historic chance to widen the circle even further, to fight radicalism and terror with justiceand dignity, to achieve a true peace, founded on human freedom. The United Nations and my country share the deepest commitments. Both the AmericanDeclaration of Independence and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaim the equal value and dignity of every human life. That dignity is honored by the rule of law, limitson the power of the state, respect for women, protection of private property, free speech, equal justice, and religious tolerance. That dignity is dishonored by oppression, corruption,tyranny, bigotry, terrorism and all violence against the innocent. And both of our founding documents affirm that this bright line between justice and injustice -- between right andwrong -- is the same in every age, and every culture, and every nation. Wise governments also stand for these principles for very practical and realistic reasons. We know that dictators are quick to choose aggression, while free nations strive to resolve differences in peace. We know that oppressive governments support terror, while freegovernments fight the terrorists in their midst. We know that free peoples embrace progressand life, instead of becoming the recruits for murderous ideologies. Every nation that wants peace will share the benefits of a freer world. And every nation thatseeks peace has an obligation to help build that world. Eventually, there is no safe isolation from terror networks, or failed states that shelter them, or outlaw regimes, or weapons ofmass destruction. Eventually, there is no safety in looking away, seeking the quiet life byignoring the struggles and oppression of others. In this young century, our world needs a new definition of security. Our security is not merely found in spheres of influence, or some balance of power. The security of our world is found inthe advancing rights of mankind. These rights are advancing across the world -- and across the world, the enemies of human rights are responding with violence. Terrorists and their allies believe the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights and the American Bill of Rights, and every charter of liberty ever written, are lies, to be burned and destroyed and forgotten. They believe that dictators should control every mind and tongue in the Middle East and beyond. They believe that suicide andtorture and murder are fully justified to serve any goal they declare. And they act on theirbeliefs. In the last year alone, terrorists have attacked police stations, and banks, and commutertrains, and synagogues -- and a school filled with children. This month in Beslan we saw, once again, how the terrorists measure their success -- in the death of the innocent, and in the painof grieving families. Svetlana Dzebisov was held hostage, along with her son and her nephew -- her nephew didnot survive. She recently visited the cemetery, and saw what she called the ""little graves."" She said, ""I understand that there is evil in the world. But what have these little creaturesdone?"" Members of the United Nations, the Russian children did nothing to deserve such awful suffering, and fright, and death. The people of Madrid and Jerusalem and Istanbul andBaghdad have done nothing to deserve sudden and random murder. These acts violate the standards of justice in all cultures, and the principles of all religions. All civilized nations are inthis struggle together, and all must fight the murderers. We're determined to destroy terror networks wherever they operate, and the United States isgrateful to every nation that is helping to seize terrorist assets, track down their operatives, and disrupt their plans. We're determined to end the state sponsorship of terror -- and mynation is grateful to all that participated in the liberation of Afghanistan. We're determined to prevent proliferation, and to enforce the demands of the world -- and my nation is grateful tothe soldiers of many nations who have helped to deliver the Iraqi people from an outlawdictator. The dictator agreed in 1991, as a condition of a cease-fire, to fully comply with all Security Council resolutions -- then ignored more than a decade of those resolutions. Finally, theSecurity Council promised serious consequences for his defiance. And the commitments we make must have meaning. When we say ""serious consequences,"" for the sake of peace, theremust be serious consequences. And so a coalition of nations enforced the just demands of theworld. Defending our ideals is vital, but it is not enough. Our broader mission as U.N. members is toapply these ideals to the great issues of our time. Our wider goal is to promote hope and progress as the alternatives to hatred and violence. Our great purpose is to build a betterworld beyond the war on terror. Because we believe in human dignity, America and many nations have established a globalfund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. In three years the contributing countries have funded projects in more than 90 countries, and pledged a total of $5.6 billion to these efforts.America has undertaken a $15 billion effort to provide prevention and treatment and humane care in nations afflicted by AIDS, placing a special focus on 15 countries where the need ismost urgent. AIDS is the greatest health crisis of our time, and our unprecedentedcommitment will bring new hope to those who have walked too long in the shadow of death. Because we believe in human dignity, America and many nations have joined together toconfront the evil of trafficking in human beings. We're supporting organizations that rescue the victims, passing stronger anti-trafficking laws, and warning travelers that they will be heldto account for supporting this modern form of slavery. Women and children should never beexploited for pleasure or greed, anywhere on Earth. Because we believe in human dignity, we should take seriously the protection of life fromexploitation under any pretext. In this session, the U.N. will consider a resolution sponsored by Costa Rica calling for a comprehensive ban on human cloning. I support that resolution andurge all governments to affirm a basic ethical principle: No human life should ever beproduced or destroyed for the benefit of another. Because we believe in human dignity, America and many nations have changed the way we fight poverty, curb corruption, and provide aid. In 2002 we created the Monterrey Consensus,a bold approach that links new aid from developed nations to real reform in developing ones. And through the Millennium Challenge Account, my nation is increasing our aid to developingnations that expand economic freedom and invest in the education and health of their ownpeople. Because we believe in human dignity, America and many nations have acted to lift the crushing burden of debt that limits the growth of developing economies, and holds millions ofpeople in poverty. Since these efforts began in 1996, poor countries with the heaviest debt burdens have received more than $30 billion of relief. And to prevent the build-up of futuredebt, my country and other nations have agreed that international financial institutions shouldincreasingly provide new aid in the form of grants, rather than loans. Because we believe in human dignity, the world must have more effective means to stabilizeregions in turmoil, and to halt religious violence and ethnic cleansing. We must create permanent capabilities to respond to future crises. The United States and Italy have proposed a Global Peace Operations Initiative. G-8 countries will train 75,000 peacekeepers, initiallyfrom Africa, so they can conduct operations on that continent and elsewhere. The countries ofthe G-8 will help this peacekeeping force with deployment and logistical needs. At this hour, the world is witnessing terrible suffering and horrible crimes in the Darfur regionof Sudan, crimes my government has concluded are genocide. The United States played a key role in efforts to broker a cease-fire, and we're providing humanitarian assistance to theSudanese people. Rwanda and Nigeria have deployed forces in Sudan to help improve security so aid can be delivered. The Security Council adopted a new resolution that supports an expanded African Union forceto help prevent further bloodshed, and urges the government of Sudan to stop flights by military aircraft in Darfur. We congratulate the members of the Council on this timely andnecessary action. I call on the government of Sudan to honor the cease-fire it signed, and tostop the killing in Darfur. Because we believe in human dignity, peaceful nations must stand for the advance ofdemocracy. No other system of government has done more to protect minorities, to secure the rights of labor, to raise the status of women, or to channel human energy to the pursuitsof peace. We've witnessed the rise of democratic governments in predominantly Hindu and Muslim, Buddhist, Jewish and Christian cultures. Democratic institutions have taken root in modern societies, and in traditional societies. When it comes to the desire for liberty andjustice, there is no clash of civilizations. People everywhere are capable of freedom, andworthy of freedom. Finding the full promise of representative government takes time, as America has found in twocenturies of debate and struggle. Nor is there any -- only one form of representative government -- because democracies, by definition, take on the unique character of thepeoples that create them. Yet this much we know with certainty: The desire for freedom resides in every human heart. And that desire cannot be contained forever by prison walls, ormartial laws, or secret police. Over time, and across the Earth, freedom will find a way. Freedom is finding a way in Iraq and Afghanistan -- and we must continue to show ourcommitment to democracies in those nations. The liberty that many have won at a cost must be secured. As members of the United Nations, we all have a stake in the success of theworld's newest democracies. Not long ago, outlaw regimes in Baghdad and Kabul threatened the peace and sponsored terrorists. These regimes destabilized one of the world's most vital -- and most volatile -- regions. They brutalized their peoples, in defiance of all civilized norms. Today, the Iraqi andAfghan people are on the path to democracy and freedom. The governments that are rising will pose no threat to others. Instead of harboring terrorists, they're fighting terrorist groups.And this progress is good for the long-term security of us all. The Afghan people are showing extraordinary courage under difficult conditions. They're fighting to defend their nation from Taliban holdouts, and helping to strike against theterrorists killers. They're reviving their economy. They've adopted a constitution that protects the rights of all, while honoring their nation's most cherished traditions. More than 10 million Afghan citizens -- over 4 million of them women -- are now registered tovote in next month's presidential election. To any who still would question whether Muslimsocieties can be democratic societies, the Afghan people are giving their answer. Since the last meeting of this General Assembly, the people of Iraq have regainedsovereignty. Today, in this hall, the Prime Minister of Iraq and his delegation represent a country that has rejoined the community of nations. The government of Prime Minister Allawihas earned the support of every nation that believes in self-determination and desires peace. And under Security Council resolutions 1511 and 1546, the world is providing that support.The U.N., and its member nations, must respond to Prime Minister Allawi's request, and domore to help build an Iraq that is secure, democratic, federal, and free. A democratic Iraq has ruthless enemies, because terrorists know the stakes in that country. They know that a free Iraq in the heart of the Middle East will be a decisive blow against theirambitions for that region. So a terrorists group associated with al Qaeda is now one of the main groups killing the innocent in Iraq today -- conducting a campaign of bombings againstcivilians, and the beheadings of bound men. Coalition forces now serving in Iraq are confronting the terrorists and foreign fighters, so peaceful nations around the world will neverhave to face them within our own borders. Our coalition is standing beside a growing Iraqi security force. The NATO Alliance is providingvital training to that force. More than 35 nations have contributed money and expertise to help rebuild Iraq's infrastructure. And as the Iraqi interim government moves toward nationalelections, officials from the United Nations are helping Iraqis build the infrastructure of democracy. These selfless people are doing heroic work, and are carrying on the great legacyof Sergio de Mello. As we have seen in other countries, one of the main terrorist goals is to undermine, disrupt, and influence election outcomes. We can expect terrorist attacks to escalate as Afghanistan and Iraq approach national elections. The work ahead is demanding. But these difficulties willnot shake our conviction that the future of Afghanistan and Iraq is a future of liberty. Theproper response to difficulty is not to retreat, it is to prevail. The advance of freedom always carries a cost, paid by the bravest among us. America mournsthe losses to our nation, and to many others. And today, I assure every friend of Afghanistan and Iraq, and every enemy of liberty: We will stand with the people of Afghanistan and Iraquntil their hopes of freedom and security are fulfilled. These two nations will be a model for the broader Middle East, a region where millions havebeen denied basic human rights and simple justice. For too long, many nations, including my own, tolerated, even excused, oppression in the Middle East in the name of stability.Oppression became common, but stability never arrived. We must take a different approach. We must help the reformers of the Middle East as they work for freedom, and strive to build acommunity of peaceful, democratic nations. This commitment to democratic reform is essential to resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict. Peace will not be achieved by Palestinian rulers who intimidate opposition, tolerate corruption, andmaintain ties to terrorist groups. The longsuffering Palestinian people deserve better. Theydeserve true leaders capable of creating and governing a free and peaceful Palestinian state. Even after the setbacks and frustrations of recent months, goodwill and hard effort can achieve the promise of the road map to peace. Those who would lead a new Palestinian stateshould adopt peaceful means to achieve the rights of their people, and create the reformed institutions of a stable democracy. Arab states should end incitement in their own media, cutoff public and private funding for terrorism, and establish normal relations with Israel. Israel should impose a settlement freeze, dismantle unauthorized outposts, end the daily humiliationof the Palestinian people, and avoid any actions that prejudice final negotiations. And world leaders should withdraw all favor and support from any Palestinian ruler who fails his peopleand betrays their cause. The democratic hopes we see growing in the Middle East are growing everywhere. In thewords of the Burmese democracy advocate, Aung San Suu Kyi: We do not accept the notion that democracy is a Western value. To the contrary, democracy simply means good government rooted in responsibility, transparency, andaccountability.1 Here at the United Nations, you know this to be true. In recent years, this organization hashelped create a new democracy in East Timor, and the U.N. has aided other nations in makingthe transition to self-rule. Because I believe the advance of liberty is the path to both a safer and better world, today Ipropose establishing a Democracy Fund within the United Nations. This is a great calling for this great organization. The fund would help countries lay the foundations of democracy by instituting the rule of lawand independent courts, a free press, political parties and trade unions. Money from the fund would also help set up voter precincts and polling places, and support the work of electionmonitors. To show our commitment to the new Democracy Fund, the United States will makean initial contribution. I urge other nations to contribute, as well. Today, I've outlined a broad agenda to advance human dignity, and enhance the security ofall of us. The defeat of terror, the protection of human rights, the spread of prosperity, the advance of democracy -- these causes, these ideals, call us to great work in the world. Each ofus alone can only do so much. Together, we can accomplish so much more. History will honor the high ideals of this organization. The charter states them with clarity: ""tosave succeeding generations from the scourge of war,"" ""to reaffirm faith in fundamentalhuman rights,"" ""to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom."" Let history also record that our generation of leaders followed through on these ideals, even inadversity. Let history show that in a decisive decade, members of the United Nations did not grow weary in our duties, or waver in meeting them. I'm confident that this young century will be liberty's century. I believe we will rise to this moment, because I know the character of somany nations and leaders represented here today. And I have faith in the transforming powerof freedom. May God bless you. 1 Full quotation: ""We do not accept the notion that democracy is a Western value.

"Thank you all. Thank you all for coming. We had a long night, and a great night. The voters turned out in record numbers and delivered an historic victory. Earlier today, Senator Kerry called with his congratulations. We had a really good phone call.He was very gracious. Senator Kerry waged a spirited campaign, and he and his supporterscan be proud of their efforts. Laura and I wish Senator Kerry and Teresa and their wholefamily all our best wishes. America has spoken, and I'm humbled by the trust and the confidence of my fellow citizens.With that trust comes a duty to serve all Americans, and I will do my best to fulfill that dutyevery day as your President. There are many people to thank, and my family comes first. Laura is the love of my life. I'm glad you love her, too. I want to thank our daughters, who joined their dad for his last campaign. I appreciate the hard work of my sister and my brothers. I especially want to thank my parents for their loving support. I'm grateful to the Vice-President and Lynne and their daughters, who have worked so hardand been such a vital part of our team. The Vice-President serves America with wisdom andhonor, and I'm proud to serve beside him. I want to thank my superb campaign team. I want to thank you all for your hard work. I wasimpressed every day by how hard and how skillful our team was. I want to thank our chairman Mark Racicot; the campaign manager, Ken Mehlman; thearchitect, Karl Rove. I want to thank Ed Gillespie for leading our Party so well. I want to thank the thousands of our supporters across our country. I want to thank you foryour hugs on the rope lines. I want to thank you for your prayers on the rope lines. I want tothank you for your kind words on the rope lines. I want to thank you for everything you did tomake the calls and to put up the signs, to talk to your neighbours, and to get out the vote. And because you did the incredible work, we are celebrating today. There's an old saying, ""Do not pray for tasks equal to your powers; pray for powers equal toyour tasks."" In four historic years, America has been given great tasks and faced them with strength andcourage. Our people have restored the vigor of this economy and shown resolve and patience in a newkind of war. Our military has brought justice to the enemy and honor to America. Our nation -- Our nation has defended itself and served the freedom of all mankind. I'm proudto lead such an amazing country, and I am proud to lead it forward. Because we have done the hard work, we are entering a season of hope. We'll continue oureconomic progress. We'll reform our outdated tax code. We'll strengthen the Social Security for the nextgeneration. We'll make public schools all they can be, and we will uphold our deepest values of family andfaith. We'll help the emerging democracies of Iraq and Afghanistan, so they can grow in strengthand defend their freedom, and then our servicemen and women will come home with thehonor they have earned. With good allies at our side, we will fight this war on terror with every resource of our nationalpower, so our children can live in freedom and in peace. Reaching these goals will require the broad support of Americans, so today I want to speak toevery person who voted for my opponent. To make this nation stronger and better, I will needyour support and I will work to earn it. I will do all I can do to deserve your trust. A new term is a new opportunity to reach out to the whole nation. We have one country, oneconstitution, and one future that binds us. And when we come together and work together,there is no limit to the greatness of America. Let me close with a word to the people of the state of Texas. We have known each other thelongest, and you started me on this journey. On the open plains of Texas, I first learned thecharacter of our country -- sturdy and honest, and as hopeful as the break of day. I willalways be grateful to the good people of my State. And whatever the road that lies ahead,that road will take me home. A campaign has ended, and the United States of America goes forward with confidence andfaith. I see a great day coming for our country, and I am eager for the work ahead. God bless you. And may God bless America.",bush
"Please be seated. Thank you all very much. Thanks for the warm welcome. Mr. Prime Minister, thank you, and Mrs. Martin, for a fantastic dinner last night in Ottawa. We really loved it. My only regret today is that Laura is not with me. She is -- went home to thank those who have been decorating the White House for the great Christmas season that's coming up. I marriedwell. I appreciate the Premiers who are here. Premier Hamm, thank you for your hospitality. Premier Lord, Premier Binns, and Premier Williams, I appreciate you all joining. I want to specifically mention the Premiers 'cause, as an ex-governor, I feel a special kinship to those who run the provinces here in Canada. But thank you for your service. Ambassador Cellucci, mayors, local officials, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, I am honored to be with you today to reaffirm America's enduring ties to your country. I am really glad to be in Canada, and I'm really glad to be among friends. I appreciate the warm hospitality we'vereceived. In the past year, I've come to know your new Prime Minister. We've met in Mexico, in the United States, in Chile, and now in Canada. Paul Martin is a leader who is asserting Canada's good influence in the world. And as I prepare for a second term in office, I look forward to asuccessful working partnership between our two countries. Paul and I share a great vision for the future, two prosperous, independent nations joinedtogether by the return of NHL hockey. I told Paul that I really have only one regret about this visit to Canada. There's a prominent citizen who endorsed me in the 2000 election, and I wanted a chance to finally thank him forthat -- that endorsement. I was hoping to meet Jean Poutine. I'm proud to stand in this historic place, which has welcomed home so many Canadians who defended liberty overseas, and where so many new Canadians began their North American dream. I'm grateful for the hospitality shown by the people of this fine city who have been sovery kind to Americans before. Three years ago, Halifax and other towns and villages -- from Newfoundland to Manitoba to the Northwest Territories to British Columbia -- welcomed, as the Prime Minister mentioned, more than 33,000 passengers on diverted flights. For days after September the 11th, Canadians came to the aid of men and women and children who were worried and confused and had nowhere to sleep. You opened your homes and your churches to strangers. You brought food; you set up clinics; you arranged for calls to their loved ones, and you asked fornothing in return. One American declared, ""My heart is overwhelmed at the outpouring of Canadian compassion. How does a person say 'thank you' to a nation?"" Well, that's something a President can do. And so let me say directly to the Canadian people, and to all of you here today who welcomedAmericans, thank you for your kindness to America in an hour of need. That emergency revealed the good and generous heart of this country, and showed the true feelings of Canadians and Americans toward each other. The affection that appeared in an instant will always be there, and it runs deep. Beyond the words of politicians and the naturaldisagreements that nations will have, our two peoples are one family, and always will be. We're united in part by the daily contact of commerce, and both our nations are better off for it. In the 10 years since the North American Free Trade Agreement was enacted, trade between the United States and Canada has nearly doubled. Twenty-three percent of America's exports go directly north; and more than 80 percent of Canadians' exports go to my country. With so much trade, there are bound to be some disagreements. I proudly ate some Alberta beef last night and I'm still standing. With determined efforts, and relying on sound science and mutual goodwill, we can resolve issues. Take, for example, those PEI potatoes. Right, Mr.Premier? Canada represents America's most vital trade relationship in the whole world, and we will doall that is necessary to keep that relationship strong. Yet, our ties go deeper than trade. Our community of values reaches back centuries. Canada and the U.S. may have disagreed on the wisdom of separating from the Crown, but we've always agreed on the great principles of liberty derived from our common heritage. We believe in the dignity of every human life, and we believe in the right of every person to live in freedom. We believe in free markets, humanized by compassion and fairness. We believe a diverse society can also be united by principles of justice and equality. The values we hold have made us good neighbors for centuries, and they will keep us as strong allies and goodfriends for the centuries to come. These shared convictions have also led our great democracies to accept a mission in the wider world. We know it is not possible to live in quiet isolation of our peaceful continent, hoping the problems and challenges of other nations will pass us by. We know there can be no security, no lasting peace in a world where proliferation and terrorism, and genocide, and extremepoverty go unopposed. We know that our own interests are served by an international system that advances human rights, and open societies, and free trade, and the rule of law, and the hope that comes from self-government. Both Canada and the United States have accepted important global duties,and we will meet those responsibilities, for our own benefit and for the good of mankind. Canada's leadership is helping to build a better world. Over the past decade, Canadian troops have helped bring stability to Bosnia and Kosovo. Canada's willingness to send peacekeepers to Haiti saved thousands of lives and helped save Haiti's constitutional government. Canadian troops are serving bravely in Afghanistan at this hour. Other Canadians stand on guard forpeace in the Middle East, in Cyprus, Sudan, and the Congo. Just two weeks ago, NATO countries showed their esteem for your military by electing General Ray Henault as Chairman of NATO's Military Committee. This admiration for your armed forces goes way back, and for good reason. It was said during World War I, the Canadians never budge. America respects the skill and honor and the sacrifice of Canadians' armed -- Canada'sarmed forces. Our nations play independent roles in the world, yet our purposes are complementary. We have important work ahead. A new term in office is an important opportunity to reach out to our friends. I hope to foster a wide international consensus among three great goals. The first great commitment is to defend our security and spread freedom by building effectivemultinational and multilateral institutions and supporting effective multilateral action. The tasks of the 21st century, from fighting proliferation to fighting the scourge of HIV/AIDS, to fighting poverty and hungry [sic] cannot be accomplished by a single nation alone. The United States and Canada participate together in more multilateral institutions than perhaps any two nations on Earth -- from NATO in Europe to the OAS in the Western Hemisphere to APEC in the Pacific. Canada and the United States are working with a coalition of nations through the Proliferation Security Initiative to stop and seize shipments of weapons of massdestruction, materials and delivery systems on land and at sea and in the air. America always prefers to act with allies at our side, and we're grateful to Canada for working closely with us to confront the challenges of Iran and North Korea. Multilateral organizationscan do great good in the world. Yet, the success of multilateralism is measured not merely by following a process, but by achieving results. The objective of the U.N. and other institutions must be collective security, not endless debate. For the sake of peace, when those bodies promise serious consequences, serious consequences must follow. America and Canada helped create the United Nations, and because we remain committed to that institution, we want it to be more than a League ofNations. My country is determined to work as far as possible within the framework of international organizations, and we're hoping that other nations will work with us to make those institutionsmore relevant and more effective in meeting the unique threats of our time. Our second commitment is to fight global terrorism with every action and resource the task requires. Canada has taken a series of critical steps to guard against the danger of terrorism. You created the Department of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness. You've toughened your anti-terror laws. You're upgrading your intelligence. I want to thank the government forall those constructive and important decisions. Our two countries are working together every day -- every day -- to keep our people safe. That is the most solemn duty I have, and the most solemn duty the Prime Minister has. From the smart border accord to the container security initiative to the joint command of NORAD, we are working together. I hope we'll also move forward on ballistic missile defense cooperation to protect the next generation of Canadians and Americans from the threats weknow will arise. The energetic defense of our nations is an important duty. Yet, defense alone is not a sufficient strategy. On September the 11th, the people of North America learned that the two vast oceans and friendly neighbors cannot fully shield us from the dangers of the 21st century. There's only one way to deal with enemies who plot in secret and set out to murder the innocent and the unsuspecting: We must take the fight to them. We must be relentlessand we must be steadfast in our duty to protect our people. Both of the countries have learned this lesson. In the early days of World War II, when the United States was still wrestling with isolationism, Canadian forces were already engaging the enemies of freedom from the Atlantic -- across the Atlantic. At the time, some Canadians argued that Canada had not been attacked and had no interest in fighting a distant war. Your Prime Minister, McKenzie King, gave this answer: ""We cannot defend our country and save our homes and families by waiting for the enemy to attack us. To remain on the defensive is the surest way to bring the war to Canada. Of course, we should protect our coasts and strengthen our ports and cities against attack,"" but the Prime Minister went on to say, ""we must also go out and meet the enemy before he reaches our shores. We must defeat him before he attacks us, before our cities are laid to waste."" McKenzie King was correct then, and we must always remember the wisdom of his wordstoday. In the new era the threat is different, but our duties are the same. Our enemies have declared their intentions -- and so have we. Peaceful nations must keep the peace by going after the terrorists and disrupting their plans and cutting off their funding. We must hold the sponsors of terror equally responsible for terrorist acts. We must prevent outlaw regimes from gaining weapons of mass destruction and providing them to terrorists. We must stay at these effortswith patience and resolve, until we prevail. Our third great commitment is to enhance our own security by promoting freedom and hope and democracy in the broader Middle East. The United States and Canada and all free nations need to look ahead. If, 20 years from now, the Middle East is dominated by dictators and mullahs who build weapons of mass destruction and harbor terrorists, our children and ourgrandchildren will live in a nightmare world of danger. That must not happen. By taking the side of reformers and democrats in the Middle East, we will gain allies in the war on terror, and isolate the ideology of murder and help to defeat the despair and hopelessnessthat feeds terror. The world will become a much safer place as democracy advances. For decades of tyranny and neglect in the broader Middle East, progress toward freedom will not come easily. I know that. Yet, it is cultural condescension to claim that some peoples orsome cultures or some religions are destined to despotism and unsuited for self-government. Today in the Middle East, the doubters and pessimists are being proven wrong. We're seeing movement toward elections, and greater rights for women, and open discussion of peaceful reform. I believe that people across the Middle East are weary of poverty and oppression and plead in silence for their liberty. I believe this is an historic moment in the broader MiddleEast, and we must seize this moment by standing with everyone who stands for liberty. We're standing with the people of Afghanistan, a nation that has gone from a safe haven for terrorists to a steadfast ally in the war on terror in three-and-a-half short years. Canada deployed more than 7,000 troops and much of your navy in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. This year, your country has led the International Security Assistance Force in Kabul. The coalition we share is doing honorable work; yet democracy is taking hold in that country because the Afghan people, like people everywhere, want to live in freedom. They registered by the millions to vote in October. They stood in long lines on election day. An Afghan widow brought all four of her daughters to vote alongside her. She said, ""When you see women here lined up to vote, this is something profound. I never dreamed this day would come."" But that woman's dream finally arrived, as it will one day across the Middle East. These are unprecedented, historic events that many said would never come. And Canadians can beproud of the part you have played in the advance of human liberty. We must also stand with the brave people of Iraq who are preparing for elections on January the 30th. Sometimes, even the closest of friends disagree. And two years ago, we disagreed about the best course of action in Iraq. Yet, as your Prime Minister made clear in Washington earlier this year, there is no disagreement at all with what has to be done in going forward. We must help the Iraqi people secure their country and build a free and democratic society. The Canadian government has pledged more than 200 million dollars in humanitarian aid and reconstruction assistance, and agreed to relieve more than 450 million dollars in Iraqi debt.That help is greatly appreciated. There's more work to be done together. Both Canada and the United States, and all free nations, have a vital interest in the success of a free Iraq. The terrorists have made Iraq the central front in the war on terror because they know what is at stake. When a free and democratic society is established in Iraq, in the heart of the Middle East, it will be a decisive blow to their aspirations to dominate the region and its people. A free Iraq will be a standingrebuke to radicalism, and a model to reformers from Damascus to Tehran. In Fallujah and elsewhere, our coalition and Iraqi forces are on the offensive and we are delivering a message: Freedom, not oppression, is the future of Iraq. Freedom is a precious right for every individual, regardless of the color of their skin or the religion they may hold. A long night of terror and tyranny in that region is ending, and a new day of freedom and hopeand self-government is on the way. And we will stand with the Palestinian and Israeli peoples and help end the destructive conflict between them. Prime Minister Martin has expressed the desire of his government to take a broader role in the quest for peace and democracy, and America welcomes your involvement.It's a time of change and a time of hope in that region. We seek justice and dignity, and a viable independent and democratic state for the Palestinian people. We seek security and peace for the state of Israel, a state that Canada, like America, first recognized in 1948. These are worthy goals in themselves, and by reaching them, we willalso remove an excuse for hatred and violence in the broader Middle East. Achieving peace in the Holy Land is not just a matter of pressuring one side or the other on the shape of a border or the site of a settlement. This approach has been tried before, without success. As we negotiate the details of peace, we must look to the heart of the matter, which is the need for a Palestinian democracy. The Palestinian people deserve a peaceful government that truly serves their interests, and the Israeli people need a true partner inpeace. Our destination is clear: two states, Israel and Palestine, living side-by-side in peace and security. And that destination can be reached by only one path, the path of democracy and reform and the rule of law. If all parties will apply effort, if all nations who are concerned about this issue will apply goodwill, this conflict can end and peace can be achieved. And thetime for that effort and the time for that goodwill is now. The United States and Canada face common threats in our world, and we share common goals that can transform our world. We're bound by history and geography and trade, and by our deepest convictions. With so much in common and so much at stake, we cannot be divided. I realize, and many Americans realize, that it's not always easy to sleep next to the elephant. Sometimes, our laws and our actions affect Canada every bit as much as they affect us, and we need to remember that. And when frustrations are vented, we must not take it personally. As a member of Canada's Parliament said in the 1960s, ""The United States is our friend,whether we like it or not."" When all is said and done, we are friends -- and we like it. Three years ago, when the American planes were diverted away from home, passengers knew they were safe and welcome the moment they saw the Maple Leaf flag. One of them later said of the Canadians he met, ""They taught me the meaning of the word, 'friend.'"" For generations,the nation of Canada has defined the word, ""friend,"" and my country is grateful. God has blessed America in many ways. God has blessed us 'cause we have neighbors likeyou. And today, I ask that God continues to bless the people of Canada. Thank you.",bush
"On this day, prescribed by law and marked by ceremony, we celebrate the durable wisdom of our Constitution, and recall the deep commitments that unite our country. I am grateful for the honor of this hour, mindful of the consequential times in which we live, and determined tofulfill the oath that I have sworn and you have witnessed. At this second gathering, our duties are defined not by the words I use, but by the history we have seen together. For a half century, America defended our own freedom by standing watch on distant borders. After the shipwreck of communism came years of relative quiet, years ofrepose, years of sabbatical - and then there came a day of fire. We have seen our vulnerability - and we have seen its deepest source. For as long as whole regions of the world simmer in resentment and tyranny - prone to ideologies that feed hatred and excuse murder - violence will gather, and multiply in destructive power, and cross the most defended borders, and raise a mortal threat. There is only one force of history that can break the reign of hatred and resentment, and expose the pretensions of tyrants, and rewardthe hopes of the decent and tolerant, and that is the force of human freedom. We are led, by events and common sense, to one conclusion: The survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands. The best hope for peace inour world is the expansion of freedom in all the world. America's vital interests and our deepest beliefs are now one. From the day of our Founding, we have proclaimed that every man and woman on this earth has rights, and dignity, and matchless value, because they bear the image of the Maker of Heaven and earth. Across the generations we have proclaimed the imperative of self-government, because no one is fit to be a master, and no one deserves to be a slave. Advancing these ideals is the mission that created our Nation. It is the honorable achievement of our fathers. Now it is the urgentrequirement of our nation's security, and the calling of our time. So it is the policy of the United States to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture, with the ultimate goal of endingtyranny in our world. This is not primarily the task of arms, though we will defend ourselves and our friends by force of arms when necessary. Freedom, by its nature, must be chosen, and defended by citizens, and sustained by the rule of law and the protection of minorities. And when the soul of a nation finally speaks, the institutions that arise may reflect customs and traditions very different from our own. America will not impose our own style of government on the unwilling. Our goal instead is to help others find their own voice, attain their own freedom, and maketheir own way. The great objective of ending tyranny is the concentrated work of generations. The difficulty of the task is no excuse for avoiding it. America's influence is not unlimited, but fortunately for the oppressed, America's influence is considerable, and we will use it confidently in freedom'scause. My most solemn duty is to protect this nation and its people against further attacks and emerging threats. Some have unwisely chosen to test America's resolve, and have found itfirm. We will persistently clarify the choice before every ruler and every nation: The moral choice between oppression, which is always wrong, and freedom, which is eternally right. America will not pretend that jailed dissidents prefer their chains, or that women welcome humiliationand servitude, or that any human being aspires to live at the mercy of bullies. We will encourage reform in other governments by making clear that success in our relations will require the decent treatment of their own people. America's belief in human dignity will guide our policies, yet rights must be more than the grudging concessions of dictators; they are secured by free dissent and the participation of the governed. In the long run, there is nojustice without freedom, and there can be no human rights without human liberty. Some, I know, have questioned the global appeal of liberty - though this time in history, four decades defined by the swiftest advance of freedom ever seen, is an odd time for doubt. Americans, of all people, should never be surprised by the power of our ideals. Eventually, the call of freedom comes to every mind and every soul. We do not accept the existence of permanent tyranny because we do not accept the possibility of permanent slavery. Liberty willcome to those who love it. Today, America speaks anew to the peoples of the world: All who live in tyranny and hopelessness can know: the United States will not ignore your oppression, or excuse your oppressors. When you stand for your liberty, we will stand withyou. Democratic reformers facing repression, prison, or exile can know: America sees you for whoyou are: the future leaders of your free country. The rulers of outlaw regimes can know that we still believe as Abraham Lincoln did: ""Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves; and, under the rule of a just God,cannot long retain it."" The leaders of governments with long habits of control need to know: To serve your people you must learn to trust them. Start on this journey of progress and justice, and America willwalk at your side. And all the allies of the United States can know: we honor your friendship, we rely on your counsel, and we depend on your help. Division among free nations is a primary goal of freedom's enemies. The concerted effort of free nations to promote democracy is a prelude toour enemies' defeat. Today, I also speak anew to my fellow citizens: From all of you, I have asked patience in the hard task of securing America, which you have granted in good measure. Our country has accepted obligations that are difficult to fulfill, and would be dishonorable to abandon. Yet because we have acted in the great liberating tradition of this nation, tens of millions have achieved their freedom. And as hope kindles hope, millions more will find it. By our efforts, we have lit a fire as well - a fire in the minds of men. It warms those who feel its power, it burns those who fight its progress, and one day thisuntamed fire of freedom will reach the darkest corners of our world. A few Americans have accepted the hardest duties in this cause - in the quiet work of intelligence and diplomacy ... the idealistic work of helping raise up free governments ... the dangerous and necessary work of fighting our enemies. Some have shown their devotion to our country in deaths that honored their whole lives - and we will always honor their namesand their sacrifice. All Americans have witnessed this idealism, and some for the first time. I ask our youngest citizens to believe the evidence of your eyes. You have seen duty and allegiance in the determined faces of our soldiers. You have seen that life is fragile, and evil is real, and courage triumphs. Make the choice to serve in a cause larger than your wants, larger than yourself - and in your days you will add not just to the wealth of our country, but to itscharacter. America has need of idealism and courage, because we have essential work at home - the unfinished work of American freedom. In a world moving toward liberty, we are determined toshow the meaning and promise of liberty. In America's ideal of freedom, citizens find the dignity and security of economic independence, instead of laboring on the edge of subsistence. This is the broader definition of liberty that motivated the Homestead Act, the Social Security Act, and the G.I. Bill of Rights. And now we will extend this vision by reforming great institutions to serve the needs of our time. To give every American a stake in the promise and future of our country, we will bring the highest standards to our schools, and build an ownership society. We will widen the ownership of homes and businesses, retirement savings and health insurance - preparing our people for the challenges of life in a free society. By making every citizen an agent of his or her own destiny, we will give our fellow Americans greater freedom from want and fear, and make our societymore prosperous and just and equal. In America's ideal of freedom, the public interest depends on private character - on integrity, and tolerance toward others, and the rule of conscience in our own lives. Self-government relies, in the end, on the governing of the self. That edifice of character is built in families, supported by communities with standards, and sustained in our national life by the truths of Sinai, the Sermon on the Mount, the words of the Koran, and the varied faiths of our people. Americans move forward in every generation by reaffirming all that is good and true thatcame before - ideals of justice and conduct that are the same yesterday, today, and forever. In America's ideal of freedom, the exercise of rights is ennobled by service, and mercy, and a heart for the weak. Liberty for all does not mean independence from one another. Our nation relies on men and women who look after a neighbor and surround the lost with love. Americans, at our best, value the life we see in one another, and must always remember that even the unwanted have worth. And our country must abandon all the habits of racism, because we cannot carry the message of freedom and the baggage of bigotry at the sametime. From the perspective of a single day, including this day of dedication, the issues and questions before our country are many. From the viewpoint of centuries, the questions that come to us are narrowed and few. Did our generation advance the cause of freedom? And did ourcharacter bring credit to that cause? These questions that judge us also unite us, because Americans of every party and background, Americans by choice and by birth, are bound to one another in the cause of freedom. We have known divisions, which must be healed to move forward in great purposes - and I will strive in good faith to heal them. Yet those divisions do not define America. We felt the unity and fellowship of our nation when freedom came under attack, and our response came like a single hand over a single heart. And we can feel that same unity and pride whenever America acts for good, and the victims of disaster are given hope, and the unjustencounter justice, and the captives are set free. We go forward with complete confidence in the eventual triumph of freedom. Not because history runs on the wheels of inevitability; it is human choices that move events. Not because we consider ourselves a chosen nation; God moves and chooses as He wills. We have confidence because freedom is the permanent hope of mankind, the hunger in dark places, the longing of the soul. When our Founders declared a new order of the ages; when soldiers died in wave upon wave for a union based on liberty; when citizens marched in peaceful outrage under the banner ""Freedom Now"" - they were acting on an ancient hope that is meant to be fulfilled. History has an ebb and flow of justice, but history also has a visible direction,set by liberty and the Author of Liberty. When the Declaration of Independence was first read in public and the Liberty Bell was sounded in celebration, a witness said, ""It rang as if it meant something."" In our time it means something still. America, in this young century, proclaims liberty throughout all the world, and to all the inhabitants thereof. Renewed in our strength - tested, but not weary - weare ready for the greatest achievements in the history of freedom. May God bless you, and may He watch over the United States of America.",bush
"Well, thank you all very much for that warm welcome. Laura and I are honored to be here this morning. I did a pretty good job when it came to picking my wife, by the way. She's going tobe a fabulous First Lady. Mr. Vice President, it's good to see you; of course, your wife, Lynn. And I want to thank the members of my Cabinet who are here. I appreciate you, Senator Frist, for your commitment and strong comments. And, Zach, thanks for your introduction. And thank you both fororganizing this important event. I want to thank the members of the House and the Senate who are here. I appreciate the number of foreign dignitaries who are here. It just goes to show that faith crosses everyborder, and touches every heart in every nation. Every President since the first one I can remember, Dwight Eisenhower, has taken part in this great tradition. It's a privilege for me to speak where they have spoken, and to pray where they have prayed. All Presidents of the United States have come to the National Prayer Breakfast, regardless of their religious views. No matter what our background, in prayer we share something universal -- a desire to speak and listen to our Maker, and to know His planfor our lives. America's Constitution forbids a religious test for office, and that's the way it should be. An American President serves people of every faith, and serves some of no faith at all. Yet I have found my faith helps me in the service to people. Faith teaches humility. As Laura would say, I ""could use a dose occasionally."" A recognition that we are small in God's universe, yet precious in His sight. It has sustained me in moments of success, and in moments ofdisappointment. Without it I'd be a different person, and without it I doubt I'd be here today. There are many experiences of faith in this room. But most of us share a belief that we are loved, and called to love; that our choices matter, now and forever; that there are purposes deeper than ambition and hopes greater than success. These beliefs shape our lives and help sustain the life of our nation. Men and women can be good without faith, but faith is a force of goodness. Men and women can be compassionate without faith, but faith often inspirescompassion. Human beings can love without faith, but faith is a great teacher of love. Our country, from its beginnings has recognized the contribution of faith. We do not impose any religion; we welcome all religions. We do not prescribe any prayer; we welcome all prayer[s]. This is the tradition of our nation, and it will be the standard of my Administration. We will respect every creed. We will honor the diversity of our country and the deepconvictions of our people. There's a good reason why many in our nation embrace the faith tradition. Throughout our history people of faith have often been our nation's voice of conscience. The foes of slavery could appeal to the standard that all are created equal in the sight of our Lord. The civil rights movement had the same conviction on its side -- that men and women bearing God's image should not be exploited and set aside, and treated as insignificant. The same impulse over the years has reformed prisons and mental institutions, hospitals, hospices, and homelessshelters. The Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. said this: ""The church must be reminded that it is not the master or the servant of the state, but rather the conscience of the state.""1 As in his case, that sometimes means defying the times, challenging old ways and old assumptions. This influence has made our nation more just and generous and decent. And our nation has needof that today. Faith remains an important -- remains important to the compassion of our nation. Millions of Americans serve their neighbor because they love their God. Their lives are characterized by kindness and patience, and service to others. They do for others what no government really can ever do -- no government program can really ever do: They provide love for anotherhuman being. They provide hope even when hope comes hard. In my second week in office we have set out to promote the work of community and faith- based charities. We want to encourage the inspired, to help the helper. Government cannot bereplaced by charities, but it can welcome them as partners instead of resenting them as rivals. My Administration will put the federal government squarely on the side of America's armies of compassion. Our plan will not favor religious institutions over non-religious institutions. As President, I'm interested in what is constitutional, and I'm interested in what works. The days of discriminating against religious institutions, simply because they are religious, must cometo an end. Faith is also important to the civility of our country. It teaches us not merely to tolerate one another, but to respect one another -- to show a regard for different views and the courtesy to listen. This is essential to democracy. It is also the proper way to treat human beings createdin the divine image. We will have our disagreements. Civility does not require us to abandon deeply-held beliefs. Civility does not demand casual creeds and colorless convictions. Americans have always believed that civility and firm resolve could live easily with one another. But civility does mean that our public debate ought to be free from bitterness and anger and rancor and ill-will. We have an obligation to make our case, not to demonize our opponents. As the Book of Jamesreminds us, fresh water and salt water cannot flow from the same spring.2 I'm under no illusion that civility will triumph in this city all at once. Old habits die hard -- and sometimes they never die at all. But I can only pledge to you this; that I will do my very bestto promote civility, and ask for the same in return. These are some of the crucial contributions of faith to our nation: justice, and compassion, and a civil and generous society. I thank you all here for displaying these values, and defending them, here in America and across the world. You strengthen the ties of friendshipand the ties of nation[s]. And I deeply appreciate your work. I believe in the power of prayer. It's been said: ""I would rather stand against the cannons of the wicked than against the prayers of the righteous."" The prayers of a friend are one of life's most gracious gifts. My family and I are blessed by the prayers of countless Americans. Over the last several months, Laura and I have been touched by the number of people who come up and say, ""We pray for you."" Such comforting words. I hope Americans will continue to praythat everyone in my Administration finds wisdom, and always remembers the common good. When President Harry Truman took office in 1945, he said this: ""At this moment, I have in my heart a prayer. I ask only to be a good and faithful servant of my Lord and my people.""3 Thishas been the prayer of many Presidents, and it is mine today. God bless. 1 Strength to Love (1963). 2 James 3:11-13: ""Can both fresh water and salt water flow from the same spring? My brothers and sisters, can a fig tree bear olives, or agrapevine bear figs? Neither can a salt spring produce fresh water."" [NIV] 3 Delivered in a speech to a Joint Session of Congress following the death of FDR",bush
"Thank you all. Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, members of Congress, fellow citizens: As a new Congress gathers, all of us in the elected branches of government share a great privilege: We've been placed in office by the votes of the people we serve. And tonight that is a privilege we share with newly elected leaders of Afghanistan, the Palestinian territories,Ukraine, and a free and sovereign Iraq. Two weeks ago, I stood on the steps of this Capitol and renewed the commitment of our nation to the guiding ideal of liberty for all. This evening I will set forth policies to advancethat ideal at home and around the world. Tonight, with a healthy, growing economy, with more Americans going back to work, with our nation an active force for good in the world, the state of our union is confident and strong. Our generation has been blessed by the expansion of opportunity, by advances in medicine, by the security purchased by our parents' sacrifice. Now, as we see a little gray in the mirror - - or a lot of gray -- and we watch our children moving into adulthood, we ask the question:What will be the state of their union? Members of Congress, the choices we make together will answer that question. Over the next several months, on issue after issue, let us do what Americans have always done and build abetter world for our children and our grandchildren. First, we must be good stewards of this economy and renew the great institutions on which millions of our fellow citizens rely. America's economy is the fastest growing of any major industrialized nation. In the past four years, we've provided tax relief to every person who pays income taxes, overcome a recession, opened up new markets abroad, prosecuted corporate criminals, raised homeownership to its highest level in history. And in the last yearalone, the United States has added 2.3 million new jobs. When action was needed, the Congress delivered, and the nation is grateful. Now we must add to these achievements. By making our economy more flexible, more innovative and morecompetitive, we will keep America the economic leader of the world. America's prosperity requires restraining the spending appetite of the federal government. I welcome the bipartisan enthusiasm for spending discipline. I will send you a budget that holds the growth of discretionary spending below inflation, makes tax relief permanent, and stays on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009. My budget substantially reduces or eliminates more than 150 government programs that are not getting results, or duplicate current efforts, or do not fulfill essential priorities. The principle here is clear: Taxpayer dollars must be spent wiselyor not at all. To make our economy stronger and more dynamic, we must prepare a rising generation to fill the jobs of the 21st century. Under the No Child Left Behind Act, standards are higher, test scores are on the rise, and we're closing the achievement gap for minority students. Now we must demand better results from our high schools so every high school diploma is a ticket to success. We will help additional -- an additional 200,000 workers to get training for a better career by reforming our job-training system and strengthening America's community colleges. And we will make it easier for Americans to afford a college education by increasing the size ofPell Grants. To make our economy stronger and more competitive, America must reward, not punish, the efforts and dreams of entrepreneurs. Small business is the path of advancement, especially for women and minorities. So we must free small businesses from needless regulation andprotect honest job creators from junk lawsuits. Justice is distorted and our economy is held back by irresponsible class actions and frivolousasbestos claims. And I urge Congress to pass legal reforms this year. To make our economy stronger and more productive, we must make health care more affordable and give families greater access to good coverage and more control over theirhealth decisions. I -- I ask Congress to move forward on a comprehensive health-care agenda with tax credits to help low-income workers buy insurance; a community health center in every poor county; improved information technology to prevent medical error and needless costs; association health plans for small businesses and their employees, expanded health savings accounts, and medical liability reform that will reduce health-care costs and make sure patients have thedoctors and care they need. To keep our economy growing, we also need reliable supplies of affordable, environmentally responsible energy. Nearly four years ago, I submitted a comprehensive energy strategy that encourages conservation, alternative sources, a modernized electricity grid and moreproduction here at home, including safe, clean nuclear energy. My Clear Skies legislation will cut power-plant pollution and improve the health of our citizens. And my budget provides strong funding for leading-edge technology, from hydrogen-fueled cars to clean coal to renewable sources such as ethanol. Four years of debate is enough. I urge Congress to pass legislation that makes America more secure and less dependent onforeign energy. All these proposals are essential to expand this economy and add new jobs, but they are just the beginning of our duty. To build the prosperity of future generations, we must update institutions that were created to meet the needs of an earlier time. Year after year, Americans are burdened by an archaic, incoherent federal tax code. I've appointed a bipartisan panel to examine the tax code from top to bottom. And when their recommendations are delivered, you and I will work together to give this nation a tax code that is pro-growth, easy tounderstand, and fair to all. America's immigration system is also outdated -- unsuited to the needs of our economy and to the values of our country. We should not be content with laws that punish hardworking people who want only to provide for their families, and deny businesses willing workers, and invite chaos at our border. It is time for an immigration policy that permits temporary guest workers to fill jobs Americans will not take, that rejects amnesty, that tells us who is entering andleaving our country, and that closes the border to drug dealers and terrorists. One of America's most important institutions -- a symbol of the trust between generations -- is also in need of wise and effective reform. Social Security was a great moral success of the 20th century, and we must honor its great purposes in this new century. The system, however, on its current path, is headed toward bankruptcy. And so we must join together to strengthen and save Social Security. Today, more than 45 million Americans receive Social Security benefits, and millions more are nearing retirement. And for them, the system issound and fiscally strong. I have a message for every American who is 55 or older: Do not let anyone mislead you. Foryou, the Social Security system will not change in any way. For younger workers, the Social Security system has serious problems that will grow worse with time. Social Security was created decades ago, for a very different era. In those days, people did not live as long, benefits were much lower than they are today, and a half centuryago, about 16 workers paid into the system for each person drawing benefits. Our society has changed in ways the founders of Social Security could not have foreseen. In today's world, people are living longer and therefore drawing benefits longer. And those benefits are scheduled to rise dramatically over the next few decades. And instead of 16 workers paying in for every beneficiary, right now it's only about three workers. And over the next few decades, that number will fall to just two workers per beneficiary. With each passing year, fewer workers are paying ever- higher benefits to an ever-larger numberof retirees. So here is the result: Thirteen years from now, in 2018, Social Security will be paying out more than it takes in. And every year afterward will bring a new shortfall, bigger than the year before. For example, in the year 2027, the government will somehow have to come up with an extra 200 billion dollars to keep the system afloat. And by 2033, the annual shortfall would be more than 300 billion dollars. By the year 2042, the entire system would be exhausted and bankrupt. If steps are not taken to avert that outcome, the only solutions would be dramatically higher taxes, massive new borrowing, or sudden and severe cuts in SocialSecurity benefits or other government programs. I recognize that 2018 and 2042 may seem a long way off. But those dates aren't so distant, as any parent will tell you. If you have a 5-year-old, you're already concerned about how you'll pay for college tuition 13 years down the road. If you've got children in their 20s, as some of us do, the idea of Social Security collapsing before they retire does not seem like asmall matter. And it should not be a small matter to the United States Congress. You and I share a responsibility. We must pass reforms that solve the financial problems of Social Security once and for all. Fixing Social Security permanently will require an open, candid review of the options. Some have suggested limiting benefits for wealthy retirees. Former Congressman Tim Penny has raised the possibility of indexing benefits to prices rather than wages. During the 1990s, my predecessor, President Clinton, spoke of increasing the retirement age. Former Senator John Breaux suggested discouraging early collection of Social Security benefits. The late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan recommended changing the waybenefits are calculated. All these ideas are on the table. I know that none of these reforms would be easy. But we have to move ahead with courage and honesty, because our children's retirement security is more important than partisanpolitics. I will work with members of Congress to find the most effective combination of reforms. I willlisten to anyone who has a good idea to offer. We must, however, be guided by some basic principles: - We must make Social Security permanently sound, not leave that task for another day. - We must not jeopardize our economic strength by increasing payroll taxes. - We must ensure that lower-income Americans get the help they need to have dignity andpeace of mind in their retirement. - We must guarantee that there is no change for those now retired or nearing retirement. - And we must take care that any changes in the system are gradual, so younger workershave years to prepare and plan for their future. As we fix Social Security, we also have the responsibility to make the system a better deal for younger workers. And the best way to reach that goal is through voluntary personalretirement accounts. Here is how the idea works: Right now, a set portion of the money you earn is taken out of your paycheck to pay for the Social Security benefits of today's retirees. If you're a younger worker, I believe you should be able to set aside part of that money in your own retirementaccount, so you can build a nest egg for your own future. Here is why the personal accounts are a better deal: Your money will grow, over time, at a greater rate than anything the current system can deliver. And your account will provide money for retirement over and above the check you will receive from Social Security. In addition, you'll be able to pass along the money that accumulates in your personal account, if you wish, to your children and -- or grandchildren. And best of all, the money in the account isyours, and the government can never take it away. The goal here is greater security in retirement, so we will set careful guidelines for personal accounts: We'll make sure the money can only go into a conservative mix of bonds and stock funds. We'll make sure that your earnings are not eaten up by hidden Wall Street fees. We'll make sure there are good options to protect your investments from sudden market swings onthe eve of your retirement. We'll make sure a personal account cannot be emptied out all at once, but rather paid out over time, as an addition to traditional Social Security benefits. And we'll make sure this plan is fiscally responsible by starting personal retirement accounts gradually and raising the yearly limits on contributions over time, eventually permitting all workers to set aside 4 percentage points of their payroll taxes in their accounts. Personal retirement accounts should be familiar to federal employees, because you already have something similar, called the Thrift Savings Plan, which lets workers deposit a portion of their paychecks into any of five different broadlybased investment funds. It's time to extend the same security and choice and ownership to young Americans. Our second great responsibility to our children and grandchildren is to honor and to pass along the values that sustain a free society. So many of my generation, after a long journey, have come home to family and faith, and are determined to bring up responsible, moral children.Government is not the source of these values, but government should never undermine them. Because marriage is a sacred institution and the foundation of society, it should not be redefined by activist judges. For the good of families, children and society, I support aconstitutional amendment to protect the institution of marriage. Because a society is measured by how it treats the weak and vulnerable, we must strive to build a culture of life. Medical research can help us reach that goal, by developing treatments and cures that save lives and help people overcome disabilities. And I thank the Congress for doubling the funding of the National Institutes of Health. To build a culture of life, we must also ensure that scientific advances always serve human dignity, not take advantage of somelives for the benefit of others. We should all be able to agree -- We should all be able to agree on some clear standards. I will work with Congress to ensure that human embryos are not created for experimentation or grown for body parts and that human life is never bought or sold as a commodity. America will continue to lead the world in medical research that is ambitious, aggressive, and alwaysethical. Because courts must always deliver impartial justice, judges have a duty to faithfully interpret the law, not legislate from the bench. As President, I have a constitutional responsibility to nominate men and women who understand the role of courts in our democracy and are well- qualified to serve on the bench, and I have done so. The Constitution also gives the Senate a responsibility: Every judicial nominee deserves anup-or-down vote. Because one of the deepest values of our country is compassion, we must never turn away from any citizen who feels isolated from the opportunities of America. Our government will continue to support faith-based and community groups that bring hope to harsh places. Now we need to focus on giving young people, especially young men in our cities, better optionsthan apathy or gangs or jail. Tonight I propose a three-year initiative to help organizations keep young people out of gangs and show young men an ideal of manhood that respects women and rejects violence. Taking on gang life will be one part of a broader outreach to at-risk youth, which involves parents and pastors, coaches and community leaders, in programs ranging from literacy to sports.And I am proud that the leader of this nationwide effort will be our First Lady, Laura Bush. Because HIV/AIDS brings suffering and fear into so many lives, I ask you to reauthorize the Ryan White Act to encourage prevention and provide care and treatment to the victims of that disease. And as we update this important law, we must focus our efforts on fellow citizenswith the highest rates of new cases: African-American men and women. Because one of the main sources of our national unity is our belief in equal justice, we need to make sure Americans of all races and backgrounds have confidence in the system that provides justice. In America we must make doubly sure no person is held to account for a crime he or she did not commit. So we are dramatically expanding the use of DNA evidence to prevent wrongful conviction. Soon I will send to Congress a proposal to fund special training for defense counsel in capitalcases, because people on trial for their lives must have competent lawyers by their side. Our third responsibility to future generations is to leave them an America that is safe from danger and protected by peace. We will pass along to our children all the freedoms we enjoy. And chief among them is freedom from fear. In the three and a half years since September the 11th, 2001, we've taken unprecedented actions to protect Americans. We've created a new department of government to defend our homeland, focused the FBI on preventing terrorism, begun to reform our intelligence agencies, broken up terror cells across the country, expanded research on defenses against biological and chemical attack, improved border security, and trained more than a half million first responders. Police and firefighters, air marshals, researchers and so many others are working every day to make our homelandsafer, and we thank them all. Our nation, working with allies and friends, has also confronted the enemy abroad with measures that are determined, successful, and continuing. The Al Qaida terror network that attacked our country still has leaders, but many of its top commanders have been removed. There are still governments that sponsor and harbor terrorists, but their number has declined. There are still regimes seeking weapons of mass destruction, but no longer without attention and without consequence. Our country is still the target of terrorists who want to kill manyand intimidate us all. And we will stay on the offensive against them until the fight is won. Pursuing our enemies is a vital commitment of the war on terror. And I thank the Congress for providing our service men and women with the resources they have needed. During this timeof war, we must continue to support our military and give them the tools for victory. Other nations around the globe have stood with us. In Afghanistan, an international force is helping provide security. In Iraq, 28 countries have troops on the ground. The United Nations and the European Union provided technical assistance for the elections. And NATO is leading amission to help train Iraqi officers. We're cooperating with 60 governments in the Proliferation Security Initiative to detect and stop the transit of dangerous materials. We're working closely with the governments in Asia to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions. Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and nine othercountries have captured or detained Al Qaida terrorists. In the next four years, my Administration will continue to build the coalitions that will defeat the dangers of our time. In the long term, the peace we seek will only be achieved by eliminating the conditions that feed radicalism and ideologies of murder. If whole regions of the world remain in despair and grow in hatred, they will be the recruiting grounds for terror, and that terror will stalk America and other free nations for decades. The only force powerful enough to stop the rise of tyranny and terror and replace hatred with hope is the force ofhuman freedom. Our enemies know this, and that is why the terrorist Zarqawi recently declared war on what he called the ""evil principle"" of democracy. And we've declared our own intention: America will stand with the allies of freedom to support democratic movements in the Middle East andbeyond, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world. The United States has no right, no desire, and no intention to impose our form of governmenton anyone else. That is one -- That is one of the main differences between us and our enemies. They seek to impose and expand an empire of oppression, in which a tiny group of brutal, self-appointed rulers control every aspect of every life. Our aim is to build and preserve a community of free and independent nations, with governments that answer to their citizens and reflect their owncultures. And because democracies respect their own people and their neighbors, the advance of freedom will lead to peace. That advance has great momentum in our time, shown by women voting in Afghanistan, and Palestinians choosing a new direction, and the people of Ukraine asserting their democratic rights and electing a president. We are witnessing landmark events in the history of liberty. And in the coming years, we will add to that story. The beginnings of reform and democracy in the Palestinian territories are now showing the power of freedom tobreak old patterns of violence and failure. Tomorrow morning, Secretary of State Rice departs on a trip that will take her to Israel and the West Bank for meetings with Prime Minister Sharon and President Abbas. She will discuss with them how we and our friends can help the Palestinian people end terror and build the institutions of a peaceful, independent, democratic state. To promote this democracy, I will ask Congress for 350 million dollars to support Palestinian political, economic and security reforms. The goal of two democratic states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace iswithin reach, and America will help them achieve that goal. To promote peace and stability in the broader Middle East, the United States will work with our friends in the region to fight the common threat of terror, while we encourage a higher standard of freedom. Hopeful reform is already taking hold in an arc from Morocco to Jordan to Bahrain. The government of Saudi Arabia can demonstrate its leadership in the region by expanding the role of its people in determining their future. And the great and proud nation of Egypt, which showed the way toward peace in the Middle East, can now show the way towarddemocracy in the Middle East. To promote peace in the broader Middle East, we must confront regimes that continue to harbor terrorists and pursue weapons of mass murder. Syria still allows its territory and parts of Lebanon to be used by terrorists who seek to destroy every chance of peace in the region.You have passed, and we are applying, the Syrian Accountability Act. And we expectthe Syrian government to end all support for terror and open the door to freedom. Today, Iran remains the world's primary state sponsor of terror -- pursuing nuclear weapons while depriving its people of the freedom they seek and deserve. We are working with European allies to make clear to the Iranian regime that it must give up its uranium enrichment program and any plutonium reprocessing and end its support for terror. And tothe Iranian people, I say tonight: As you stand for your own liberty, America stands with you. Our generational commitment to the advance of freedom, especially in the Middle East, is now being tested and honored in Iraq. That country is a vital front in the war on terror, which is why the terrorists have chosen to make a stand there. Our men and women in uniform arefighting terrorists in Iraq so we do not have to face them here at home. The victory of freedom in Iraq will strengthen a new ally in the war on terror, inspire democratic reformers from Damascus to Tehran, bring more hope and progress to a troubled region, and thereby lift a terrible threat from the lives of our children and grandchildren. We will succeed because the Iraqi people value their own liberty, as they showed the world last Sunday. Across Iraq, often at great risk, millions of citizens went to the polls and elected 275 men and women to represent them in a new transitional national assembly. A young woman in Baghdad told of waking to the sound of mortar fire on election day and wondering if it might be too dangerous to vote. She said, ""Hearing those explosions, it occurred to me, the insurgents are weak; they are afraid of democracy; they are losing. So I got my husband, andI got my parents, and we all came out and voted together."" Americans recognize that spirit of liberty, because we share it. In any nation, casting your vote is an act of civic responsibility. For millions of Iraqis, it was also an act of personalcourage, and they have earned the respect of us all. One of Iraq's leading democracy and human rights advocates is Safia Taleb al-Suhail. She says of her country, ""We were occupied for 35 years by Saddam Hussein. That was the real occupation. Thank you to the American people who paid the cost, but most of all to the soldiers."" Eleven years ago, Safia's father was assassinated by Saddam's intelligence service. Three days ago in Baghdad, Safia was finally able to vote for the leaders of her country. Andwe are honored that she is with us tonight. The terrorists and insurgents are violently opposed to democracy and will continue to attack it. Yet the terrorists' most powerful myth is being destroyed. The whole world is seeing that the car bombers and assassins are not only fighting coalition forces, they are trying to destroy the hopes of Iraqis, expressed in free elections. And the whole world now knows that a smallgroup of extremists will not overturn the will of the Iraqi people. We will succeed in Iraq because Iraqis are determined to fight for their own freedom and to write their own history. As Prime Minister Allawi said in his speech to Congress last September, ""Ordinary Iraqis are anxious to shoulder all the security burdens of our country as quickly as possible."" That is the natural desire of an independent nation, and it also is thestated mission of our coalition in Iraq. The new political situation in Iraq opens a new phase of our work in that country. At the recommendation of our commanders on the ground and in consultation with the Iraqi government, we will increasingly focus our efforts on helping prepare more capable Iraqisecurity forces -- forces with skilled officers and an effective command structure. As those forces become more self-reliant and take on greater security responsibilities, America and its coalition partners will increasingly be in a supporting role. In the end, Iraqis must be able to defend their own country, and we will help that proud, new nation secure its liberty. Recently an Iraqi interpreter said to a reporter, ""Tell America not to abandon us."" He and all Iraqis can be certain: While our military strategy is adapting to circumstances, our commitment remains firm and unchanging. We are standing for the freedom of our Iraqifriends, and freedom in Iraq will make America safer for generations to come. We will not set an artificial timetable for leaving Iraq, because that would embolden the terrorists and make them believe they can wait us out. We are in Iraq to achieve a result: a country that is democratic, representative of all its people, at peace with its neighbors and able to defend itself. And when that result is achieved, our men and women serving in Iraqwill return home with the honor they have earned. Right now, Americans in uniform are serving at posts across the world, often taking great risks on my orders. We have given them training and equipment. And they have given us anexample of idealism and character that makes every American proud. The volunteers of our military are unrelenting in battle, unwavering in loyalty, unmatched inhonor and decency, and every day they are making our nation more secure. Some of our service men and women have survived terrible injuries, and this grateful nationwill do everything we can to help them recover. And we have said farewell to some very good men and women who died for our freedom andwhose memory this nation will honor forever. One name we honor is Marine Corps Sergeant Byron Norwood of Pflugerville, Texas, who was killed during the assault on Fallujah. His mom, Janet, sent me a letter and told me how much Byron loved being a Marine and how proud he was to be on the front line against terror. She wrote, ""When Byron was home the last time, I said that I wanted to protect him like I had since he was born. He just hugged me and said, 'You've done your job, Mom. Now it is my turn to protect you.'"" Ladies and gentlemen, with grateful hearts, we honor freedom's defenders and our military families, represented here this evening by Sergeant Norwood'smom and dad, Janet and Bill Norwood. In these four years, Americans have seen the unfolding of large events. We have known times of sorrow and hours of uncertainty and days of victory. In all this history, even when we havedisagreed, we have seen threads of purpose that unite us. The attack on freedom in our world has reaffirmed our confidence in freedom's power to change the world. We're all part of a great venture: to extend the promise of freedom in our country, to renew the values that sustain our liberty and to spread the peace that freedombrings. As Franklin Roosevelt once reminded Americans, ""Each age is a dream that is dying or onethat is coming to birth."" And we live in the country where the biggest dreams are born. The abolition of slavery was only a dream -- until it was fulfilled. The liberation of Europe from fascism was only a dream -- until it was achieved. The fall of imperial communism was only a dream -- until, one day, it was accomplished. Our generation has dreams of its own, and we also go forward with confidence. The road ofprovidence is uneven and unpredictable, yet we know where it leads: It leads to freedom. Thank you. And may God bless America.",bush
"Thank you, all. Please be seated. It is great to be back to this fine university. Many great military leaders of the 20th century, from Dwight Eisenhower, to Colin Powell, studied on this campus. And today the National Defense University is training a new generation of leaders who will serve and defend this nation in a new century. Americans are grateful for yourdevotion to duty, and so is your Commander-in-Chief. I am honored that two influential and important members of the United States Congress have joined us. First, Senator Joe Lieberman, strong defender of freedom. Thank you for coming, Senator. And the Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Congressman Duncan Hunter. Proud you're here, Dunc. Thanks for coming. In the midst of what we hope will be thefinal snow blizzard of 2005, I'm honored you two men slushed here to this event. I appreciate so very much Lieutenant General Michael Dunn and his wife, Pam, for greeting me and for serving our nation. I want to thank all the National Defense University students for being here. I appreciate the staff for joining us. I want to thank the members of the diplomatic corps who have come today. It is an honor to see you all again. I want to thank my fellow Americans for caring about the subject of peace,and that's what I'm here to discuss. We meet at a time of great consequence for the security of our nation, a time when thedefense of freedom requires the advance of freedom, a time with echoes in our history. Twice in six decades, a sudden attack on the United States launched our country into a global conflict, and began a period of serious reflection on America's place in the world. The bombing of Pearl Harbor taught America that unopposed tyranny, even on far-away continents, could draw our country into a struggle for our own survival. And our reflection on that lesson led us to help build peaceful democracies in the ruins of tyranny, to unite free nations in the NATOAlliance, and to establish a firm commitment to peace in the Pacific that continues to this day. The attacks of September the 11th, 2001 also revealed the outlines of a new world. In one way, that assault was the culmination of decades of escalating violence -- from the killing of U.S. Marines in Beirut, to the bombing at the World Trade Center, to the attacks on American embassies in Africa, to the attacks on the USS Cole. In another way, September the 11th provided a warning of future dangers -- of terror networks aided by outlaw regimes, and ideologies that incite the murder of the innocent, and biological and chemical and nuclearweapons that multiply destructive power. Like an earlier generation, America is answering new dangers with firm resolve. No matter how long it takes, no matter how difficult the task, we will fight the enemy, and lift theshadow of fear, and lead free nations to victory. Like an earlier generation, America is pursuing a clear strategy with our allies to achieve victory. Our immediate strategy is to eliminate terrorist threats abroad, so we do not have to face them here at home. The theory here is straightforward: terrorists are less likely to endanger our security if they are worried about their own security. When terrorists spend their days struggling to avoid death or capture, they are less capable of arming and training to commit new attacks. We will keep the terrorists on the run, until they have nowhere left tohide. In three and a half years, the United States and our allies have waged a campaign of global scale -- from the mountains of Afghanistan, to the border regions of Pakistan, to the Horn of Africa, to the islands of the Philippines, to the plains of North Central Iraq. The al Qaeda terror network that attacked our country still has leaders, but many of its top commanders have been removed. There are still governments that sponsor and harbor terrorists, but their number has declined. There are still regimes seeking weapons of mass destruction -- but no longer without attention and without consequence. Our country is still the target of terrorists who want to kill many, and intimidate us all. We will stay on the offensive against them, untilthe fight is won. Members of our military are undertaking difficult missions, in some of the most dangerous and desolate parts of the world. These volunteers know the risks they face, and they know the cause they serve. As one Marine sergeant put it, ""I never want my children to experience what we saw in New York, at the Pentagon, and in Pennsylvania."" He said, ""If we can eliminate whatever threat we can on foreign soil, I would rather do it there than have it come [home] to us."" In this vital cause, some of our men and women in uniform have fallen, some have returned home with terrible injuries, and all who sacrifice will have the permanentgratitude of the United States of America. In this war on terror, America is not alone. Many governments have awakened to the dangers we share and have begun to take serious action. Global terror requires a global response, andAmerica is more secure today because dozens of other countries have stepped up to the fight. We're more secure because Pakistani forces captured more than one hundred extremists across the country last year, including operatives who were plotting attacks against the United States. We're more secure because Britain arrested an al Qaeda operative who had provided detailed casing reports on American targets to senior al Qaeda leaders. We're more secure because German authorities arrested extremists who were planning attacks against U.S. and coalition targets in Iraq. We're more secure because the Philippines' new Anti-Terrorism Task Force has helped capture more than a dozen terrorist suspects -- including seven members of al Qaeda and affiliated networks. We're more secure because Poland is leading a 15-nation multi-national division in Iraq, and forces from 23 countries have given their lives in thestruggle against terrorists and insurgents in Afghanistan and Iraq. Our allies in the war on terror are making tough decisions, and they're taking risks, and they're losing lives. These countries have proven themselves trusted friends and reliable allies. So I urge the Congress to pass the Solidarity Initiative I have proposed to stand by thecountries that are standing by us in the war on terror. Our strategy to keep the peace in the longer term is to help change the conditions that give rise to extremism and terror, especially in the broader Middle East. Parts of that region have been caught for generations in a cycle of tyranny and despair and radicalism. When a dictatorship controls the political life of a country, responsible opposition cannot develop, and dissent is driven underground and toward the extreme. And to draw attention away from their social and economic failures, dictators place blame on other countries and other races, and stir the hatred that leads to violence. This status quo of despotism and anger cannot be ignored or appeased, kept in a box or bought off, because we have witnessed how the violence in that region can reach easily across borders and oceans. The entire world has anurgent interest in the progress, and hope, and freedom in the broader Middle East. The advance of hope in the Middle East requires new thinking in the region. By now it should be clear that authoritarian rule is not the wave of the future; it is the last gasp of a discredited past. It should be clear that free nations escape stagnation, and grow stronger with time, because they encourage the creativity and enterprise of their people. It should be clear that economic progress requires political modernization, including honest representative government and the rule of law. And it should be clear that no society can advance with onlyhalf of its talent and energy -- and that demands the full participation of women. The advance of hope in the Middle East also requires new thinking in the capitals of great democracies -- including Washington, D.C. By now it should be clear that decades of excusing and accommodating tyranny, in the pursuit of stability, have only led to injustice and instability and tragedy. It should be clear that the advance of democracy leads to peace, because governments that respect the rights of their people also respect the rights of their neighbors. It should be clear that the best antidote to radicalism and terror is the tolerance and hope kindled in free societies. And our duty is now clear: For the sake of our long-term security, all free nations must stand with the forces of democracy and justice that have begunto transform the Middle East. Encouraging democracy in that region is a generational commitment. It's also a difficult commitment, demanding patience and resolve -- when the headlines are good and when the headlines aren't so good. Freedom has determined enemies, who show no mercy for the innocent, and no respect for the rules of warfare. Many societies in the region struggle with poverty and illiteracy, many rulers in the region have longstanding habits of control; manypeople in the region have deeply ingrained habits of fear. For all these reasons, the chances of democratic progress in the broader Middle East have seemed frozen in place for decades. Yet at last, clearly and suddenly, the thaw has begun. The people of Afghanistan have embraced free government, after suffering under one of the most backward tyrannies on earth. The voters in Iraq defied threats of murder, and have set their country on a path to full democracy. The people of the Palestinian Territories cast their ballots against violence and corruption of the past. And any who doubt the appeal of freedom in the Middle East can look to Lebanon, where the Lebanese people are demanding a free and independent nation. In the words of one Lebanese observer, ""Democracy is knocking at the door of this country and, if it's successful in Lebanon, it is going to ring the doors of everyArab regime."" Across the Middle East, a critical mass of events is taking that region in a hopeful new direction. Historic changes have many causes, yet these changes have one factor in common. A businessman in Beirut recently said, ""We have removed the mask of fear. We're not afraid anymore."" Pervasive fear is the foundation of every dictatorial regime -- the prop that holds up all power not based on consent. And when the regime of fear is broken, and the people find their courage and find their voice, democracy is their goal, and tyrants, themselves, havereason to fear. History is moving quickly, and leaders in the Middle East have important choices to make. The world community, including Russia and Germany and France and Saudi Arabia and the United States has presented the Syrian government with one of those choices -- to end its nearly 30- year occupation of Lebanon, or become even more isolated from the world. The Lebanese people have heard the speech by the Syrian president. They've seen these delaying tactics and half-measures before. The time has come for Syria to fully implement Security Council Resolution 1559. All Syrian military forces and intelligence personnel must withdraw beforethe Lebanese elections, for those elections to be free and fair. The elections in Lebanon must be fully and carefully monitored by international observers. The Lebanese people have the right to determine their future, free from domination by a foreign power. The Lebanese people have the right to choose their own parliament this spring, free of intimidation. And that new government will have the help of the international community in building sound political, economic, and military institutions, so the great nation of Lebanoncan move forward in security and freedom. Today I have a message for the people of Lebanon: All the world is witnessing your great movement of conscience. Lebanon's future belongs in your hands, and by your courage, Lebanon's future will be in your hands. The American people are on your side. Millions across the earth are on your side. The momentum of freedom is on your side, and freedom willprevail in Lebanon. America and other nations are also aware that the recent terrorist attack in Tel Aviv was conducted by a radical Palestinian group headquartered in Damascus. Syria, as well as Iran, has a long history of supporting terrorist groups determined to sow division and chaos in the Middle East, and there is every possibility they will try this strategy again. The time has come for Syria and Iran to stop using murder as a tool of policy, and to end all support forterrorism. In spite of attacks by extremists, the world is seeing hopeful progress in the Israel-Palestinian conflict. There is only one outcome that will end the tyranny, danger, violence and hopelessness, and meet the aspirations of all people in the region: We seek two democraticstates, Israel and Palestine, living side-by-side in peace and security. And that goal is within reach, if all the parties meet their responsibilities and if terrorism is brought to an end. Arab states must end incitement in their own media, cut off public and private funding for terrorism, stop their support for extremist education, and establish normal relations with Israel. Israel must freeze settlement activity, help the Palestinians build a thriving economy, and ensure that a new Palestinian state is truly viable, with contiguous territory on the West Bank. Palestinian leaders must fight corruption, encourage freeenterprise, rest true authority with the people, and actively confront terrorist groups. The bombing in Tel Aviv is a reminder that the fight against terrorists is critical to the search for peace and for Palestinian statehood. In an interview last week, Palestinian President Abbas strongly condemned the terrorist attack in Tel Aviv, declaring, ""Ending violence and security chaos is first and foremost a Palestinian interest."" He went on to say, ""We cannot build thefoundations of a state without the rule of law and public order."" President Abbas is correct. And so the United States will help the Palestinian Authority build the security services that current peace and future statehood require: security forces which are effective, responsive to civilian control, and dedicated to fighting terror and upholding the rule of law. We will coordinate with the government of Israel, with neighbors such as Egypt and Jordan, and with other donors to ensure that Palestinians get the training and equipment they need. The United States is determined to help the parties remove obstacles to progressand move forward in practical ways, so we can seize this moment for peace in the Holy Land. In other parts of the Middle East, we're seeing small but welcome steps. Saudi Arabia's recent municipal elections were the beginning of reform that may allow greater participation in the future. Egypt has now -- has now the prospect of competitive, multi-party elections for President in September. Like all free elections, these require freedom of assembly, multiple candidates, free access by those candidates to the media, and the right to form political parties. Each country in the Middle East will take a different path of reform. And every nationthat starts on that journey can know that America will walk at its side. Progress in the Middle East is threatened by weapons of mass destruction and their proliferation. Today, Great Britain, France, and Germany are involved in a difficult negotiation with Iran aimed at stopping its nuclear weapons program. We want our allies to succeed, because we share the view that Iran's acquisition of nuclear weapons would be destabilizing and threatening to all of Iran's neighbors. The Iranian regime should listen to the concerns of the world, and listen to the voice of the Iranian people, who long for their liberty and want their country to be a respected member of the international community. We look forward to the day when Iran joins in the hopeful changes taking place across the region. We lookforward to the day when the Iranian people are free. Iran and other nations have an example in Iraq. The recent elections have begun a process of debate and coalition building unique in Iraqi history, and inspiring to see. Iraq's leaders are forming a government that will oversee the next -- and critical -- stage in Iraq's political transition: the writing of a permanent constitution. This process must take place without external influence. The shape of Iraq's democracy must be determined by the Iraqis,themselves. Iraq's democracy, in the long run, must also be defended by Iraqis, themselves. Our goal is to help Iraqi security forces move toward self-reliance, and they are making daily progress. Iraqi forces were the main providers of security at about 5,000 polling places in the January elections. Our coalition is providing equipment and training to the new Iraqi military, yet theybring a spirit all of their own. Last month, when soldiers of the U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment were on combat patrol north of Baghdad, one of their Humvees fell into a canal, and Iraqi troops came to their rescue -- plunging into the water again and again, until the last American was recovered. The Army colonel in charge of the unit said, ""When I saw those Iraqis in the water, fighting to save their American brothers, I saw a glimpse of the future of this country."" One of the Iraqi soldiers commented, ""These people have come a hundred -- 10,000 miles to help my country. They've left their families and their children. If we can give them something back, just a little, we can show our thanks."" America is proud to defend freedom in Iraq, and proud to stand with thebrave Iraqis as they defend their own freedom. Three and a half years ago, the United States mourned our dead, gathered our resolve, and accepted a mission. We made a decision to stop threats to the American people before they arrive on our shores, and we have acted on that decision. We're also determined to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture,with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world. This objective will not be achieved easily, or all at once, or primarily by force of arms. We know that freedom, by definition, must be chosen, and that the democratic institutions of other nations will not look like our own. Yet we also know that our security increasingly depends on the hope and progress of other nations now simmering in despair and resentment.And that hope and progress is found only in the advance of freedom. This advance is a consistent theme of American strategy -- from the Fourteen Points, to the Four Freedoms, to the Marshall Plan, to the Reagan Doctrine. Yet the success of this approach does not depend on grand strategy alone. We are confident that the desire for freedom, even when repressed for generations, is present in every human heart. And that desire can emergewith sudden power to change the course of history. Americans, of all people, should not be surprised by freedom's power. A nation founded on the universal claim of individual rights should not be surprised when other people claim those rights. Those who place their hope in freedom may be attacked and challenged, but they will not ultimately be disappointed, because freedom is the design of humanity and freedom is thedirection of history. In our time, America has been attacked. America has been challenged. Yet the uncertainty, and sorrow, and sacrifice of these years have not been in vain. Millions have gained their liberty; and millions more have gained the hope of liberty that will not be denied. The trumpetof freedom has been sounded, and that trumpet never calls retreat. Before history is written in books, it is written in courage -- the courage of honorable soldiers; the courage of oppressed peoples; the courage of free nations in difficult tasks. Our generation is fortunate to live in a time of courage. And we are proud to serve in freedom'scause. May God bless you all",bush
"Thank you all for the warm welcome. It wasn't all that long ago that I brought my family over to go to church Easter Sunday here at Fort Hood. I've been looking forward to coming back and giving you a proper Army greeting: Hoo-ah! It's an honor to be with the courageous menand women of the ""Phantom Corps."" The soldiers and families of Fort Hood have contributed mightily to our efforts in the war on terror. Many of you have recently returned from Iraq. Welcome home -- and thank you for a job well-done. Others are preparing to head out this fall -- some for a second tour of duty. Whether you're coming or going, you are making an enormous difference for the security of our nation and for the peace of the world. I want to thank you for defending your fellow citizens. I want to thank you for extending liberty to millions. And I want to thank you formaking America proud. I especially want to thank the military families who are here today. I want to thank you for your sacrifices in the war on terror. It isn't easy being the one left behind when a loved one goes to war. You have a wonderful community here at Fort Hood. I thank you for the support you have given to each other. By loving and supporting a soldier, you are also serving our nation. Americans are grateful for your sacrifice and your service -- and so is yourCommander-in-Chief. I want to thank Lieutenant General Tom Metz, and his wife, Pam. I want to thank Command Sergeant Major Joe Gainey, and his lovely wife. I want to thank all the officers and soldiers of this fantastic base. I appreciate our fine Governor from the state of Texas, Governor Rick Perry, for joining us today. I want to thank Congressman John Carter and Congressman Chet Edwards for joining us today. I'm looking forward to giving them a ride back to Washingtonon Air Force One. I suspect they're looking forward to the ride back. I want to thank Major General Pete Chiarelli for being with us today, and his wife, Beth; Major General JD Thurman, and his wife, Dee; Command Sergeant Major Tom McMurtrie. And all thesoldiers, airmen, military families, veterans, friends of Fort Hood, and the Three Corps. This weekend we marked the two-year anniversary of the liberation of Baghdad. Coalition forces crossed more than 350 miles of desert to get there, pushing through dust storms and death squads. They reached the Iraqi capital in 21 days, and that achievement will be studiedfor generations as the fastest armored advance in military history. The coalition assault was rapid, and it wasn't easy. The enemy hid in schools and hospitals. They used civilians as human shields. Yet our troops persevered. We protected civilian lives while destroying the Republican Guard's Medina Division, pushing through the Karbala Gap,capturing Saddam International Airport, and, on April 9th, we liberated the Iraqi capital. For millions of Iraqis and Americans, it is a day they will never forget. The toppling of Saddam Hussein's statue in Baghdad will be recorded, alongside the fall of the Berlin Wall, as one of the great moments in the history of liberty. And eight months later, soldiers of the Ivy Division brought the real Saddam Hussein to justice. When Ironhorse soldiers left for Iraq, Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator sitting in a palace, and by the time you came home, hewas sitting in a prison cell. When it came time to drive the terrorists and insurgents from Fallujah, soldiers of the 1st Cavalry Division spearheaded the assault. The ""First Team"" was ""First in Fallujah"" -- and when the dust settled, what you found there reminds us why we are at war: Blood-stained torture chambers used by terrorists to execute hostages; you found videos of beheadings and brutal terrorist attacks; you found over 600 improvised explosive devices, including an ice creamtruck that had been loaded with bomb-making materials for a terrorist attack. The men and women of the Phantom Corps know why we are in Iraq. As one First Team soldier, Lieutenant Mike Erwin, put it: ""If we can start to change the most powerful country in the Middle East, the others will follow, and Americans 20 years down the road won't have todeal with a day like September the 11th, 2001."" The terrorists have made Iraq a central front in the war on terror. Because of your service, because of your sacrifice, we are defeating them there where they live, so we do not have to face them where we live. Because of you, the people of Iraq no longer live in fear of being executed and left in mass graves. Because of you, freedom is taking root in Iraq. Our successin Iraq will make America safer, for us and for future generations. In my liberation message to the Iraqi people, I made them a solemn promise: ""The government of Iraq, and the future of your country, will soon belong to you."" I went on to say: ""We will help you build a peaceful and representative government that protects the rightsof all citizens. And then our military forces will leave."" From the beginning, our goal in Iraq has been to promote Iraqi independence -- by helping the Iraqi people establish a free country that can sustain itself, rule itself, and defend itself. And in the last two years, Iraqis have made enormous progress toward that goal. Iraqis have laid the foundations of a free society, with hundreds of independent newspapers and dozens of political parties and associations, and schools that teach Iraqi children how to read and write, instead of the propaganda of Saddam Hussein. Iraqis have laid the foundation of a free economy, with a new currency and independent central bank, new laws to encourage foreigninvestment, and thousands of small businesses established since liberation. The troops from Fort Hood have done their part. In Baghdad, soldiers of the 1st Cavalry Division launched Operation Adam Smith, and the new generation of Iraqi entrepreneurs you helped nurture will create jobs and opportunities for millions of their fellow citizens. Iraqis have laid the foundation for a society built on the rule of law. Today, courts are functioning across Iraq, and hundreds of independent Iraqi judges have been trained in Bahrain andJordan and Czech Republic and Britain and Italy. An Iraqi special tribunal has been established that will try senior leadership, including Saddam Hussein. He will get the trial that he did not afford his fellow citizens when he was in power. Slowly but surely, the land that gave civilization the first written code of law is now restoringthe rule of law, and setting the example for people across the Middle East. Iraqis have laid a solid foundation for democratic self-government. The world watched in awe as the Iraqi people defied the car bombers and assassins to cast their votes in the country's first free and democratic election in decades. It took courage, the kind of courage displayed by a 29-year-old Iraqi policeman named Abdul Amir. On election day, Amir noticed a suspicious man walking toward the line of voters at a Baghdad polling station. With complete disregard for his own safety, he threw his arms around the man and dragged him into a nearby intersection, where the man detonated the belt of explosives that was wrapped around his body. Amir took the brunt of the blast, giving his own life to save scores of innocentcivilians. He is a hero of a free Iraq, and the world honors his valor and his sacrifice. Because of brave Iraqis like Abdul Amir, today the free nation of Iraq has elected a transitional assembly, a President and two Deputy Presidents, leaders who answer to thepeople, instead of the other way around. I've spoken with the new leaders of Iraq, President Talabani, as well as Speaker -- Assembly Speaker al-Hassani. I congratulated them on their achievement. I told them I look forward to working with the new government that will soon be established. I assured them that the United States will continue to stand with the Iraqi people as they take control of their destinyand assume the blessings of self-government. There's a lot of hard work ahead. The Iraqi people face brutal and determined enemies. But Iraqis are also determined, and they have the will to defeat the insurgency. The soldiers and police of a free Iraq learned on election day they can face down the insurgents, and they learned they can prevail. The Iraqi people now have confidence that the soldiers and police of a free Iraq have the courage and resolve to defend them. The Iraqi security forces are fighting bravely for the future of their country, and in the last six months alone, more than 800 havegiven their lives in the struggle. The soldiers of Fort Hood have seen their courage in action. Sergeant First Class Troy Hawkins recently put it, ""The Iraqis will stand and fight. I've seen guys with grenade fragments in them, bleeding, pulling people off the street and getting kids out of the way. Then they'll fight the enemy. They're determined to make this work."" And the United States is determined tohelp the Iraqis succeed. As Iraq's new government assumes increasing responsibility for the stability of their country, security operations are entering a new phase. Iraq security forces are becoming more self- reliant and taking on greater responsibilities. And that means that America and its coalition partners are increasingly playing more of a supporting role. Today, more than 150,000 Iraqi security forces have been trained and equipped, and for the first time, the Iraqi army, police and security forces now outnumberU.S. forces in Iraq. Like free people everywhere, Iraqis want to be defended and led by their own countrymen. We will help them achieve this objective so Iraqis can secure their own nation. And then ourtroops will come home with the honor they have earned. The Iraqi people know the sacrifices you are making. They're grateful to you. They are grateful to your families. One Iraqi army colonel put it this way: ""These U.S. soldiers leave their wives and kids to come here and give us freedom. We have to thank them for doing that for us."" You are making possible the peace of Iraq, and you are making possible the security of free nations. Yours is noble work, it's important work, and I thank you for assuming yourduty. As the Iraq democracy succeeds, that success is sending a message from Beirut to Tehran that freedom can be the future of every nation. The establishment of a free Iraq at the heart of the Middle East will be a crushing defeat to the forces of tyranny and terror, and awatershed event in the global democratic revolution. In the last two years, you have accomplished much, yet your work isn't over. Freedom still faces dangerous adversaries. Terrorists still want to attack our people. But they're losing. These terrorists are losing the struggle because they're under constant pressure from our Armed Forces, and they will remain under constant pressure from our Armed Forces. And they are losing the struggle because they are on the wrong side of history. Across the broader Middle East, the tide of freedom is surging. The people of Afghanistan have embraced free government, after suffering under one of the most backward tyrannies on Earth. The people of the Palestinian Territories cast their ballots against violence and corruption of the past. The people of Lebanon are rising up to demand their freedom and independence. Saudi Arabia has held its first municipal elections in decades. Egypt is taking its first steps on the path to democratic reform. A critical mass of events is taking that region in a hopeful new direction. And as freedom spreads in the Middle East and beyond, the American people will be safer andthe free world more secure. You have fought the battles in the war on terror, and you have served the cause of freedom.And you can be proud of all that you have achieved. This time of brave achievement is also a time of sacrifice. Many of our soldiers have returned from war with grave wounds that they will carry with them the rest of their lives. And America will fulfill its duty by providing them the best medical care possible. Still others have given their lives in this struggle -- your friends, your comrades. We honor their memory. We lift them up in prayer. Their sacrifice will always be remembered by a grateful nation. We can live as free people because men and women like you have stepped forward and havevolunteered to serve. I came here today to thank you in person for your courageous choice of service. You're making America proud. You're making America free. And you're making the world more peaceful. I want to thank you for all you've done for our great nation. May God bless you and your families. And may God continue to bless this great land of liberty, the United States ofAmerica.",bush
"Thank you, President Byker; members of the faculty; distinguished guests; parents, friends,family -- and, most importantly, the Class of 2005. Thanks for having me. I was excited to come back to Calvin, and I was just telling Laura the other night about what fun it would be to come to Calvin College. And I said, you know, ""Laura, I love being around so many young folks. You know, it gives me a chance to re-live my glory days in academia."" She said, ""George, that's not exactly how I would describe your college experience."" She also said one other thing I think the graduates will appreciate hearing, good piece of advice. She said, the folks here are here to get their diploma, not tohear from an old guy go on too long. So with that sage advice, here goes. I bring a great message of hope and freedom to Calvin College Class of 2005: There's life after Professor Vanden Bosch and English 101. Someday you will appreciate the grammar and verbal skills you learned here. And if any of you wonder how far a mastery of the Englishlanguage can take you, just look what it did for me. I thank the moms and dads here for your sacrifice and for your love. I want to thank the faculty for your hard work and dedication. And, again, I congratulate the Class of 2005. Soon -- soon you will collect your degrees and say goodbyes to a school that has been your home, and you will take your rightful place in a country that offers you the greatest freedom and opportunity on Earth. I ask that you use what you've learned here to make your owncontributions to the story of American freedom. The immigrants who founded Calvin College came to America for the freedom to worship, and they built this great school on the sturdy ground of liberty. They saw in the American ""experiment"" the world's best hope for freedom -- and they weren't the only ones excited about what they saw. In 1835, a young civil servant and aristocrat from France, named Alexisde Tocqueville, would publish a book about America that still resonates today. The book is called ""Democracy in America,"" and in it this young Frenchman said that the secret to America's success was our talent for bringing people together for the common good. De Tocqueville wrote that tyrants maintained their power by ""isolating"" their citizens -- and that Americans guaranteed their freedom by their remarkable ability to band together without any direction from government. The America he described offered the world something it had never seen before: a working model of a thriving democracy where opportunity was unbounded, where virtue was strong, and where citizens took responsibility for theirneighbors. Tocqueville's account is not just the observations of one man -- it is the story of our founding. It's not just a description of America at a point in time -- it is an agenda for our time. Our Founders rejected both a radical individualism that makes no room for others, and the dreary collectivism that crushes the individual. They gave us instead a society where individual freedom is anchored in communities. And in this hopeful new century, we have a great goal: to renew this spirit of community and thereby renew the character and compassion of ourcountry. First, we must understand that the character of our citizens is essential to society. In a free and compassionate society, the public good depends on private character. That character is formed and shaped in institutions like family, faith, and the many civil and -- social and civic organizations, from the Boy Scouts to the Rotary Clubs. The future success of our nation depends on our ability to understand the difference between right and wrong and to have the strength of character to make the right choices. Governmentcannot create character, but it can and should respect and support the institutions that do. Second, we must understand the importance of keeping power close to the people. Local people know local problems, they know the names and faces of their neighbors. The heart and soul of America is in our local communities; it is in the citizen school boards that determine how our children are educated; it's in city councils and state legislators that reflect the unique needs and priorities of the people they serve; it's in the volunteer groups that transform towns and cities into caring communities and neighborhoods. In the years to come, I hope that you'll consider joining these associations or serving in government -- because when you come together to serve a cause greater than yourself, you will energize your communities andyou will help build a more just and compassionate America. Finally, we must understand that it is by becoming active in our communities that we move beyond our narrow interests. In today's complex world, there are a lot of things that pull us apart. We need to support and encourage the institutions and pursuits that bring us together. And we learn how to come together by participating in our churches and temples and mosques and synagogues; in civil rights associations; in our PTAs and Jaycees; in our gardening and book clubs, interest groups and chambers of commerce; in our service groups -- from soupkitchens to homeless shelters. All these organizations promote the spirit of community and help us acquire the ""habits of heart"" that are so vital to a free society. And because one of the deepest values of our country is compassion, we must never turn away from any citizen who feels isolated from the opportunities of America. Our faith-based and community groups provide the armies of compassion that help people who wonder if the American Dream is meant for them. These armies of compassion are the great engines of social change. They serve individual and localneeds, and they have been found at the front of every great movement in American history. The history of forming associations dedicated to serving others is as old as America, itself. From abolition societies and suffrage movements to immigrant aid groups and prison reform ministries, America's social entrepreneurs have often been far ahead of our government in identifying and meeting the needs of our fellow countrymen. Because they are closer to the people they serve, our faith-based and community organizations deliver better results than government. And they have a human touch: When a person in need knocks on the door of a faith-based or community organization, he or she iswelcomed as a brother or a sister. No one understood this better than another 19th century visitor to America whose name is well known to Calvin College: Abraham Kuyper. Kuyper was a Dutchman who would be elected his nation's prime minister, and he knew all about the importance of associations because he founded so many of them -- including two newspapers, a political party, and a university. Kuyper contrasted the humanizing influence of independent social institutions with the ""mechanical character of government."" And in a famous speech right here in Grand Rapids, he urged Dutch immigrants to resist the temptation to retreat behind their own walls. He told them to go out into their adopted America and make a true difference as trueChristian citizens. Our government is encouraging all Americans to make a difference through our faith-based and community initiative; we're mobilizing Americans to volunteer through the USA Freedom Corps. We'll do our part, but, ultimately, service is up to you. It is your choice to make. As your generation takes its place in the world, all of you must make this decision: Will you be a spectator or a citizen? To make a difference in this world, you must be involved. By serving a higher calling here or abroad, you'll make your lives richer and build a more hopeful future forour world. At Calvin College, you take this call to service to heart. You serve as ""agents of renewal"" across the Earth. You volunteer for Big Brothers/Big Sisters to mentor young people. You work at Bethany Christian Services here in Grand Rapids, one of the best-known adoption services in America. A former Calvin student and professor, Vern Ehlers, serves in the halls of Congress. As the Class of 2005 goes out into the world, I ask you to embrace this tradition of service and help set an example for all Americans. As Americans we share an agenda that calls us to action -- a great responsibility to serve and love others, a responsibility that goesback to the greatest commandment. This isn't a Democrat idea. This isn't a Republican idea. This is an American idea. It has sustained our nation's liberty for more than 200 years. The Founders knew that too much government leads to oppression, but that too little government can leave us helpless and alone. So they built a free society with many roots in community. And to keep the tree ofliberty standing tall in the century before us, you must nourish those roots. Today, the Calvin Class of 2005 looks out on an America that continues to be defined by the promise of our Declaration of Independence. We're [still] the nation our Founders imagined, where individual freedom and opportunity is unbounded, where community is vibrant, where compassion keeps us from resting until all our citizens take their place at the banquet of freedom and equality. And with your help, we'll all do our part to transform our great land oneperson and one community at a time. Thank you for having me and may God bless you, and may God continue to bless our country.",bush
"Good evening. I'm speaking to you from the city of New Orleans -- nearly empty, still partly under water, and waiting for life and hope to return. Eastward from Lake Pontchartrain, acrossthe Mississippi coast, to Alabama into Florida, millions of lives were changed in a day by acruel and wasteful storm. In the aftermath, we have seen fellow citizens left stunned and uprooted, searching for lovedones, and grieving for the dead, and looking for meaning in a tragedy that seems so blind and random. We've also witnessed the kind of desperation no citizen of this great and generous nation should ever have to know -- fellow Americans calling out for food and water, vulnerablepeople left at the mercy of criminals who had no mercy, and the bodies of the dead lyinguncovered and untended in the street. These days of sorrow and outrage have also been marked by acts of courage and kindnessthat make all Americans proud. Coast Guard and other personnel rescued tens of thousands of people from flooded neighborhoods. Religious congregations and families have welcomedstrangers as brothers and sisters and neighbors. In the community of Chalmette, when two men tried to break into a home, the owner invitedthem to stay -- and took in 15 other people who had no place to go. At Tulane Hospital for Children, doctors and nurses did not eat for days so patients could have food, and eventuallycarried the patients on their backs up eight flights of stairs to helicopters. Many first responders were victims themselves, wounded healers, with a sense of duty greater than their own suffering. When I met Steve Scott of the Biloxi Fire Department, he and hiscolleagues were conducting a house-to-house search for survivors. Steve told me this, ""I lostmy house and I lost my cars, but I still got my family, and I still got my spirit."" Across the Gulf Coast, among people who have lost much, and suffered much, and given to the limit of their power, we are seeing that same spirit -- a core of strength that survives allhurt, a faith in God no storm can take away, and a powerful American determination to clearthe ruins and build better than before. Tonight so many victims of the hurricane and the flood are far from home and friends andfamiliar things. You need to know that our whole nation cares about you, and in the journey ahead you're not alone. To all who carry a burden of loss, I extend the deepest sympathy of our country. To every person who has served and sacrificed in this emergency, I offer thegratitude of our country. And tonight I also, also offer this pledge of the American people: Throughout the area hit by the hurricane, we will do what it takes, we will stay as long as ittakes, to help citizens rebuild their communities and their lives. And all who question the future of the Crescent City need to know there is no way to imagine America without NewOrleans, and this great city will rise again. The work of rescue is largely finished; the work of recovery is moving forward. In nearly all of Mississippi, electric power has been restored. Trade is starting to return to the Port of NewOrleans, and agricultural shipments are moving down the Mississippi River. All major gasoline pipelines are now in operation, preventing the supply disruptions that many feared. The breaks in the levees have been closed, the pumps are running, and the water here in NewOrleans is receding by the hour. Environmental officials are on the ground, taking water samples, identifying and dealing with hazardous debris, and working to get drinking water andwaste water treatment systems operating again. And some very sad duties are being carried out by professionals who gather the dead, treat them with respect, and prepare them for theirrest. In the task of recovery and rebuilding, some of the hardest work is still ahead, and it willrequire the creative skill and generosity of a united country. Our first commitment is to meet the immediate needs of those who had to flee their homesand leave all their possessions behind. For these Americans, every night brings uncertainty, every day requires new courage, and in the months to come will bring more than their fairshare of struggles. The Department of Homeland Security is registering evacuees who are now in shelters and churches, or private homes, whether in the Gulf region or far away. I have signed an orderproviding immediate assistance to people from the disaster area. As of today, more than 500,000 evacuee families have gotten emergency help to pay for food, clothing, and otheressentials. Evacuees who have not yet (registered? 5:38) registered should contact FEMA or the Red Cross. We need to know who you are, because many of you will be eligible for broader assistance in the future. Many families were separated during the evacuation, and weare working to help you reunite. Please call this number: 1-877-568-3317 -- that's 1-877- 568-3317 -- and we will work to bring your family back together, and pay for your travel toreach them. In addition, we're taking steps to ensure that evacuees do not have to travel great distances or navigate bureaucracies to get the benefits that are there for them. The Department ofHealth and Human Services has sent more than 1,500 health professionals, along with over 50 tons of medical supplies -- including vaccines and antibiotics and medicines for people withchronic conditions such as diabetes. The Social Security Administration is delivering checks. The Department of Labor is helping displaced persons apply for temporary jobs and unemployment benefits. And the Postal Service is registering new addresses so that peoplecan get their mail. To carry out the first stages of the relief effort and begin rebuilding at once, I have asked for, and the Congress has provided, more than $60 billion dollars. This is an unprecedentedresponse to an unprecedented crisis, which demonstrates the compassion and resolve of ournation. Our second commitment is to help the citizens of the Gulf Coast to overcome this disaster, put their lives back together, and rebuild their communities. Along this coast, for mile after mile,the wind and water swept the land clean. In Mississippi, many thousands of houses were damaged or destroyed. In New Orleans and surrounding parishes, more than a quarter-millionhouses are no longer safe to live in. Hundreds of thousands of people from across this regionwill need to find longer-term housing. Our goal is to get people out of the shelters by the middle of October. So we're providingdirect assistance to evacuees that allows them to rent apartments, and many already are moving into places of their own. A number of states have taken in evacuees and shown themgreat compassion -- admitting children to school, and providing health care. So I will workwith the Congress to ensure that states are reimbursed for these extra expenses. In the disaster area, and in cities that have received huge numbers of displaced people, we'rebeginning to bring in mobile homes and trailers for temporary use. To relieve the burden on local health care facilities in the region, we're sending extra doctors and nurses to theseareas. We're also providing money that can be used to cover overtime pay for police and firedepartments while the cities and towns rebuild. Near New Orleans, Biloxi, and other cities, housing is urgently needed for police and firefighters, other service providers, and the many workers who are going to rebuild thesecities. Right now, many are sleeping on ships we have brought to the Port of New Orleans -- and more ships are on their way to the region. And we'll provide mobile homes, and supplythem with basic services, as close to construction areas as possible, so the rebuilding processcan go forward as quickly as possible. And the federal government will undertake a close partnership with the states of Louisiana and Mississippi, the city of New Orleans, and other Gulf Coast cities, so they can rebuild in asensible, well-planned way. Federal funds will cover the great majority of the costs of repairing public infrastructure in the disaster zone, from roads and bridges to schools andwater systems. Our goal is to get the work done quickly. And taxpayers expect this work to be done honestly and wisely -- so we'll have a team of inspectors general reviewing allexpenditures. In the rebuilding process, there will be many important decisions and many details to resolve, yet we're moving forward according to some clear principles. The federal government will be fully engaged in the mission, but Governor Barbour, Governor Blanco, Mayor Nagin, and otherstate and local leaders will have the primary role in planning for their own future. Clearly, communities will need to move decisively to change zoning laws and building codes, in orderto avoid a repeat of what we've seen. And in the work of rebuilding, as many jobs as possibleshould go to the men and women who live in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Our third commitment is this: When communities are rebuilt, they must be even better andstronger than before the storm. Within the Gulf region are some of the most beautiful and historic places in America. As all ofus saw on television, there's also some deep, persistent poverty in this region as well. That poverty has roots in a history of racial discrimination, which cut off generations from theopportunity of America. We have a duty to confront this poverty with bold action. So let us restore all that we have cherished from yesterday, and let us rise above the legacy ofinequality. When the streets are rebuilt, there should be many new businesses, including minority-owned businesses, along those streets. When the houses are rebuilt, more familiesshould own, not rent, those houses. When the regional economy revives, local people shouldbe prepared for the jobs being created. Americans want the Gulf Coast not just to survive, but to thrive; not just to cope, but to overcome. We want evacuees to come home, for the best of reasons -- because they have areal chance at a better life in a place they love. When one resident of this city who lost his home was asked by a reporter if he would relocate, he said, ""Naw, I will rebuild -- but I will build higher."" That is our vision for the future, in thiscity and beyond. We'll not just rebuild, we'll build higher and better. To meet this goal, I will listen to good ideas from Congress, and state and local officials, and the private sector. Ibelieve we should start with three initiatives that the Congress should pass. Tonight I propose the creation of a Gulf Opportunity Zone, encompassing the region of thedisaster in Louisiana and Mississippi and Alabama. Within this zone, we should provide immediate incentives for job-creating investment, tax relief for small businesses, incentives tocompanies that create jobs, and loans and loan guarantees for small businesses, including minority-owned enterprises, to get them up and running again. It is entrepreneurship thatcreates jobs and opportunity; it is entrepreneurship that helps break the cycle of poverty; andwe will take the side of entrepreneurs as they lead the economic revival of the Gulf region. I propose the creation of Worker Recovery Accounts to help those evacuees who need extra help finding work. Under this plan, the federal government would provide accounts of up to$5,000, which these evacuees could draw upon for job training and education to help themget a good job, and for child care expenses during their job search. And to help lower-income citizens in the hurricane region build new and better lives, I alsopropose that Congress pass an Urban Homesteading Act. Under this approach, we will identify property in the region owned by the federal government, and provide building sites to low- income citizens free of charge, through a lottery. In return, they would pledge to build on the lot, with either a mortgage or help from a charitable organization like Habitat for Humanity. Home ownership is one of the great strengths of any community, and it must be a central partof our vision for the revival of this region. In the long run, the New Orleans area has a particular challenge, because much of the city lies below sea level. The people who call it home need to have reassurance that their lives will besafer in the years to come. Protecting a city that sits lower than the water around it is not easy, but it can, and has been done. City and parish officials in New Orleans, and stateofficials in Louisiana will have a large part in the engineering decisions to come. And the Army Corps of Engineers will work at their side to make the flood protection system stronger than ithas ever been. The work that has begun in the Gulf Coast region will be one of the largest reconstructionefforts the world has ever seen. When that job is done, all Americans will have something to be very proud of -- and all Americans are needed in this common effort. It is the armies ofcompassion -- charities and houses of worship, and idealistic men and women -- that give our reconstruction effort its humanity. They offer to those who hurt a friendly face, an arm aroundthe shoulder, and the reassurance that in hard times, they can count on someone who cares. By land, by sea, and by air, good people wanting to make a difference deployed to the GulfCoast, and they've been working around the clock ever since. The cash needed to support the armies of compassion is great, and Americans have givengenerously. For example, the private fundraising effort led by former Presidents Bush and Clinton has already received pledges of more than $100 million dollars. Some of that money isgoing to the Governors to be used for immediate needs within their states. A portion will also be sent to local houses of worship to help reimburse them for the expense of helping others.This evening the need is still urgent, and I ask the American people to continue donating to the Salvation Army, the Red Cross, other good charities, and religious congregations in theregion. It's also essential for the many organizations of our country to reach out to your fellowcitizens in the Gulf area. So I've asked USA Freedom Corps to create an information clearinghouse, available at usafreedomcorps.gov, so that families anywhere in the country canfind opportunities to help families in the region, or a school can support a school. And I challenge existing organizations -- churches, and Scout troops, or labor union locals to get intouch with their counterparts in Mississippi, Louisiana, or Alabama, and learn what they can do to help. In this great national enterprise, important work can be done by everyone, andeveryone should find their role and do their part. The government of this nation will do its part, as well. Our cities must have clear and up-to- date plans for responding to natural disasters, and disease outbreaks, or a terrorist attack, for evacuating large numbers of people in an emergency, and for providing the food and waterand security they would need. In a time of terror threats and weapons of mass destruction, the danger to our citizens reaches much wider than a fault line or a flood plain. I considerdetailed emergency planning to be a national security priority, and therefore, I've ordered the Department of Homeland Security to undertake an immediate review, in cooperation with localcounterparts, of emergency plans in every major city in America. I also want to know all the facts about the government response to Hurricane Katrina. The storm involved a massive flood, a major supply and security operation, and an evacuation order affecting more than a million people. It was not a normal hurricane -- and the normaldisaster relief system was not equal to it. Many of the men and women of the Coast Guard, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the United States military, the National Guard,Homeland Security, and state and local governments performed skillfully under the worst conditions. Yet the system, at every level of government, was not well-coordinated, and wasoverwhelmed in the first few days. It is now clear that a challenge on this scale requires greater federal authority and a broader role for the armed forces -- the institution of ourgovernment most capable of massive logistical operations on a moment's notice. Four years after the frightening experience of September the 11th, Americans have every right to expect a more effective response in a time of emergency. When the federal government fails to meet such an obligation, I, as President, am responsible for the problem,and for the solution. So I've ordered every Cabinet Secretary to participate in a comprehensive review of the government response to the hurricane. This government willlearn the lessons of Hurricane Katrina. We're going to review every action and make necessary changes, so that we are better prepared for any challenge of nature, or act of evilmen, that could threaten our people. The United States Congress also has an important oversight function to perform. Congress is preparing an investigation, and I will work with members of both parties to make sure thiseffort is thorough. In the life of this nation, we have often been reminded that nature is an awesome force, andthat all life is fragile. We're the heirs of men and women who lived through those first terrible winters at Jamestown and Plymouth, who rebuilt Chicago after a great fire, and San Franciscoafter a great earthquake, who reclaimed the prairie from the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. Every time, the people of this land have come back from fire, flood, and storm to build anew - - and to build better than what we had before. Americans have never left our destiny to thewhims of nature -- and we will not start now. These trials have also reminded us that we are often stronger than we know -- with the helpof grace and one another. They remind us of a hope beyond all pain and death, a God who welcomes the lost to a house not made with hands. And they remind us that we're tiedtogether in this life, in this nation -- and that the despair of any touches us all. I know that when you sit on the steps of a porch where a home once stood, or sleep on a cotin a crowded shelter, it is hard to imagine a bright future. But that future will come. The streets of Biloxi and Gulfport will again be filled with lovely homes and the sound of childrenplaying. The churches of Alabama will have their broken steeples mended and their congregations whole. And here in New Orleans, the street cars will once again rumble downSt. Charles, and the passionate soul of a great city will return. In this place, there's a custom for the funerals of jazz musicians. The funeral procession parades slowly through the streets, followed by a band playing a mournful dirge as it moves to the cemetery. Once the casket has been laid in place, the band breaks into a joyful ""secondline"" -- symbolizing the triumph of the spirit over death. Tonight the Gulf Coast is still comingthrough the dirge -- yet we will live to see the second line. Thank you, and may God bless America.",bush
"Nellie, thank you very much. I appreciate the invitation to speak. I'm calling from Manhattan, Kansas. Sounds like you got some good folks from Kansas there. I want to thank everybody there -- if you're from Kansas, or anywhere else in our country, for your devotion to such anoble cause. You believe, as I do, that every human life has value, that the strong have a duty to protect the weak, and that the self-evident truths of the Declaration of Independence apply to everyone, not just to those considered healthy or wanted or convenient. These principles call us to defend the sick and the dying, persons with disabilities and birth defects, all who areweak and vulnerable, especially unborn children. We're making good progress in defending these principles, Nellie, and you and I are working together, along with others, to build what I've called a ""culture of life."" One of my first acts as the President was to ban the use of taxpayer money on programs that promote abortion overseas. I want to thank you all for getting that ban on partial-birth abortion to my desk, a bill I was proud to sign -- and a law which we are going to defend -- and are defending -- vigorously in our courts. Because we acted, infants who are born despite an attempted abortion are now protected by law. Thanks to ""Laci and Conner's Law,"" prosecutors can now charge those whoharm or kill a pregnant woman with harming or killing her unborn child, as well. We're vigorously promoting parental notification laws, adoption, teen abstinence, crisis pregnancy programs, and the vital work of our faith-based groups. We're sending a clear message to any woman facing a crisis pregnancy: We love you; we love your child, and we'rehere to help you. There's more work to be done. The House has passed a bill to ensure that state parental involvement laws are not circumvented by those who take minors across state lines to haveabortion[s]. And the United States Senate needs to pass this bill so I can sign it into law. We also must respect human life and dignity when advancing medical science, and we're making progress here, as well. Last month, I signed a pro-life bill supporting ethical treatment and research using stem cells from umbilical cord blood. I also renew my call for Congress to ban all forms of human cloning. Because human life is a gift from our Creator and shouldnever be used as a means to an end, we will not sanction the creation of life only to destroy it. By changing laws we can change our culture. And your persistence and prayers, Nellie, and the folks there with you, are making a real difference. We, of course, seek common ground where possible; we're working to persuade more of our fellow Americans of the rightness of our cause. And this is a cause that appeals to the conscience of our citizens, and is rooted inAmerica's deepest principles -- and history tells us that with such a cause, we will prevail. Again, Nellie, thank you for letting me come to speak to you. Tell everybody there that I ask for God's blessings on them and their families, and, of course, may God continue to bless ourgrand country.",bush
"and diplomatic corps, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens, today our nation lost a beloved, graceful, courageous woman who called America to its founding ideals and carried on a noble dream. Tonight we are comforted by the hope of a glad reunion with the husband whowas taken so long ago, and we are grateful for the good life of Coretta Scott King. Every time I'm invited to this rostrum, I am humbled by the privilege and mindful of the history we have seen together. We have gathered under this Capitol dome in moments of national mourning and national achievement. We have served America through one of themost consequential periods of our history. And it has been my honor to serve with you. In a system of two parties, two chambers and two elected branches, there will always be differences and debate. But even tough debates can be conducted in a civil tone. And our differences cannot be allowed to harden into anger. To confront the great issues before us, we must act in a spirit of good will and respect for one another. And I will do my part. And I willdo my part. Tonight the state of our Union is strong, and together we will make it stronger. In this decisive year, you and I will make choices that determine both the future and the character of our country. We will choose to act confidently in pursuing the enemies of freedom or retreat from our duties in the hope of an easier life. We will choose to build our prosperity by leading theworld economy or shut ourselves off from trade and opportunity. In a complex and challenging time, the road of isolationism and protectionism may seem broad and inviting, yet it ends in danger and decline. The only way to protect our people, the only way to secure the peace, the only way to control our destiny is by our leadership. So theUnited States of America will continue to lead. Abroad, our nation is committed to an historic, long-term goal: We seek the end of tyranny in our world. Some dismiss that goal as misguided idealism. In reality, the future security of America depends on it. On September the 11th, 2001, we found that problems originating in a failed and oppressive state 7,000 miles away could bring murder and destruction to our country. Dictatorships shelter terrorists, and feed resentment and radicalism, and seek weapons of mass destruction. Democracies replace resentment with hope, respect the rights of their citizens and their neighbors, and join the fight against terror. Every step towardfreedom in the world makes our country safer, and so we will act boldly in freedom's cause. Far from being a hopeless dream, the advance of freedom is the great story of our time. In 1945, there were about two dozen lonely democracies in the world. Today there are 122. And we are writing a new chapter in the story of self-government, with women lining up to vote in Afghanistan, and millions of Iraqis marking their liberty with purple ink, and men and womenfrom Lebanon to Egypt debating the rights of individuals and the necessity of freedom. At the start of 2006, more than half the people of our world live in democratic nations. And we do not forget the other half -- in places like Syria and Burma, Zimbabwe, North Korea and Iran -- because the demands of justice and the peace of this world require their freedom aswell. No one can deny the success of freedom, but some men rage and fight against it. And one of the main sources of reaction and opposition is radical Islam; the perversion by a few of a noble faith into an ideology of terror and death. Terrorists like bin Laden are serious about mass murder and all of us must take their declared intentions seriously. They seek to impose a heartless system of totalitarian control throughoutthe Middle East and arm themselves with weapons of mass murder. Their aim is to seize power in Iraq and use it as a safe haven to launch attacks against America and the world. Lacking the military strength to challenge us directly, the terrorists have chosen the weapon of fear. When they murder children at a school in Beslan or blow up commuters in London or behead a bound captive, the terrorists hope these horrors will break our will, allowing the violent to inherit the Earth. But they have miscalculated. We love ourfreedom, and we will fight to keep it. In a time of testing, we cannot find security by abandoning our commitments and retreating within our borders. If we were to leave these vicious attackers alone, they would not leave us alone. They would simply move the battlefield to our own shores. There is no peace in retreat. And there is no honor in retreat. By allowing radical Islam to work its will, by leaving an assaulted world to fend for itself, we would signal to all that we no longer believe in our ownideals or even in our own courage. But our enemies and our friends can be certain: The United States will not retreat from the world, and we will never surrender to evil. America rejects the false comfort of isolationism. We are the nation that saved liberty in Europe, and liberated death camps, and helped raiseup democracies and faced down an evil empire. Once again, we accept the call of history to deliver the oppressed and move this world toward peace. We remain on the offensive against terror networks. We have killed or captured many of their leaders. And, for the others, their day will come. We remain on the offensive in Afghanistan, where a fine president and a national assembly are fighting terror while buildingthe institutions of a new democracy. We're on the offensive in Iraq, with a clear plan for victory. First, we are helping Iraqis build an inclusive government, so that old resentments will be eased and the insurgency will be marginalized. Second, we are continuing reconstruction efforts and helping the Iraqi government to fight corruption and build a modern economy, so all Iraqis can experience the benefits of freedom. Third, we are striking terrorist targets while we train Iraqi forces that are increasingly capable of defeating the enemy. Iraqis are showing their courage every day, and we are proud to betheir allies in the cause of freedom. Our work in Iraq is difficult, because our enemy is brutal. But that brutality has not stopped the dramatic progress of a new democracy. In less than three years, the nation has gone from dictatorship, to liberation, to sovereignty, to a constitution, to national elections. At the same time, our coalition has been relentless in shutting off terrorist infiltration, clearing out insurgent strongholds and turning over territory to Iraqi security forces. I am confident in our plan for victory. I am confident in the will of the Iraqi people. I am confident in the skill andspirit of our military. Fellow citizens, we are in this fight to win, and we are winning. The road of victory is the road that will take our troops home. As we make progress on the ground and Iraqi forces increasingly take the lead, we should be able to further decrease our troop levels. But those decisions will be made by our military commanders, not by politicians in Washington, D.C. Our coalition has learned from our experience in Iraq. We have adjusted our military tactics and changed our approach to reconstruction. Along the way, we have benefited from responsiblecriticism and counsel offered by members of Congress of both parties. In the coming year, I will continue to reach out and seek your good advice. Yet there is a difference between responsible criticism that aims for success and defeatism that refuses to acknowledge anything but failure. Hindsight alone is not wisdom. And second-guessing is not a strategy. With so much in the balance, those of us in public office have a duty to speak with candor. A sudden withdrawal of our forces from Iraq would abandon our Iraqi allies to death and prison, would put men like bin Laden and Zarqawi in charge of a strategic country andshow that a pledge from America means little. Members of Congress, however we feel about the decisions and debates of the past, our nation has only one option: We must keep our word, defeat our enemies and stand behind the American military in its vital mission. Our men and women in uniform are making sacrifices and showing a sense of duty stronger than all fear. They know what it's like to fight house to house in a maze of streets, to wear heavy gear in the desert heat, to see a comrade killed bya roadside bomb. And those who know the costs also know the stakes. Marine Staff Sergeant Dan Clay was killed last month fighting in Fabiani. He left behind a letter to his family, but his words could just as well be addressed to every American. Here is what Dan wrote: ""I know what honor is. It has been an honor to protect and serve all of you. I faced death with the secure knowledge that you would not have to. ""Never falter. Don't hesitate to honor and support those of us who had the honor of protecting that which is worth protecting."" Staff Sergeant Dan Clay's wife,Lisa, and his mom and dad, Sara Jo and Bud, are with us this evening. Welcome. Our nation is grateful to the fallen who live in the memory of our country. We are grateful to all who volunteer to wear our nation's uniform. And, as we honor our brave troops, let usnever forget the sacrifices of America's military families. Our offensive against terror involves more than military action. Ultimately, the only way to defeat the terrorists is to defeat their dark vision of hatred and fear by offering the hopeful alternative of political freedom and peaceful change. So the United States of America supports democratic reform across the broader Middle East. Elections are vital, but they are only thebeginning. Raising up a democracy requires the rule of law, and protection of minorities, and strong, accountable institutions that last longer than a single vote. The great people of Egypt have voted in a multiparty presidential election, and now their government should open paths of peaceful opposition that will reduce the appeal of radicalism. The Palestinian people have voted in elections. And now the leaders of Hamas must recognize Israel, disarm, reject terrorism and work for lasting peace. Saudi Arabia has taken the first steps of reform. Now itcan offer its people a better future by pressing forward with those efforts. Democracies in the Middle East will not look like our own, because they will reflect the traditions of their own citizens. Yet liberty is the future of every nation in the Middle East, because liberty is the right and hope of all humanity. The same is true of Iran, a nation now held hostage by a small clerical elite that is isolating and repressing its people. The regime in that country sponsors terrorists in the Palestinian territories and in Lebanon, and that must come to an end. The Iranian government is defying the world with its nuclear ambitions, and the nations of the world must not permit the Iranian regime to gain nuclear weapons. Americawill continue to rally the world to confront these threats. And, tonight, let me speak directly to the citizens of Iran: America respects you and we respect your country. We respect your right to choose your own future and win your own freedom. And our nation hopes one day to be the closest of friends with a free and democraticIran. To overcome dangers in our world, we must also take the offensive by encouraging economic progress and fighting disease and spreading hope in hopeless lands. Isolationism would not only tie our hands in fighting enemies; it would keep us from helping our friends in desperateneed. We show compassion abroad because Americans believe in the God- given dignity and worth of a villager with HIV/AIDS, or an infant with malaria, or a refugee fleeing genocide, or a young girl sold into slavery. We also show compassion abroad because regions overwhelmed by poverty, corruption and despair are sources of terrorism and organized crime and human trafficking and the drug trade. In recent years, you and I have taken unprecedented action to fight AIDS and malaria, expand the education of girls, and reward developing nations that are moving forward with economic and political reform. For people everywhere, the United States is a partner for a better life. Short-changing these efforts would increase the suffering andchaos of our world, undercut our long-term security and dull the conscience of our country. I urge members of Congress to serve the interests of America by showing the compassion of America. Our country must also remain on the offensive against terrorism here at home. The enemy has not lost the desire or capability to attack us. Fortunately, this nation has superb professionals in law enforcement, intelligence, the military and homeland security. These men and women are dedicating their lives to protecting us all, and they deserve our support and our thanks. They also deserve the same tools they already use to fight drug trafficking andorganized crime -- so I ask you to reauthorize the Patriot Act. It is said that prior to the attacks of September the 11th, our government failed to connect the dots of the conspiracy. We now know that two of the hijackers in the United States placed telephone calls to Al Qaida operatives overseas. But we did not know about their plans until itwas too late. So to prevent another attack -- based on authority given to me by the Constitution and by statute -- I have authorized a terrorist surveillance program to aggressively pursue the international communications of suspected Al Qaida operatives and affiliates to and from America. Previous presidents have used the same constitutional authority I have and federal courts have approved the use of that authority. Appropriate members of Congress have beenkept informed. The terrorist surveillance program has helped prevent terrorist attacks. It remains essential to the security of America. If there are people inside our country who are talking with Al Qaida, we want to know about it, because we will not sit back and wait to be hit again. In all these areas -- from the disruption of terror networks, to victory in Iraq, to the spread of freedomand hope in troubled regions -- we need the support of our friends and allies. To draw that support, we must always be clear in our principles and willing to act. The only alternative to American leadership is a dramatically more dangerous and anxious world. Yet we also choose to lead because it is a privilege to serve the values that gave us birth. American leaders -- from Roosevelt, to Truman, to Kennedy, to Reagan -- rejected isolation and retreat because they knew that America is always more secure when freedom is on themarch. Our own generation is in a long war against a determined enemy, a war that will be fought by presidents of both parties who will need steady bipartisan support from the Congress. And tonight I ask for yours. Together, let us protect our country, support the men and women whodefend us, and lead this world toward freedom. Here at home, America also has a great opportunity: We will build the prosperity of our country by strengthening our economic leadership in the world. Our economy is healthy and vigorous, and growing faster than other major industrialized nations. In the last two-and-a- half years, America has created 4.6 million new jobs -- more than Japan and the European Union combined. Even in the face of higher energy prices and natural disasters, the American people have turned in an economic performance that is the envy of the world. The American economy is preeminent, but we cannot afford to be complacent. In a dynamic world economy, we are seeing new competitors like China and India. And this creates uncertainty, whichmakes it easier to feed people's fears. So we're seeing some old temptations return. Protectionists want to escape competition, pretending that we can keep our high standard of living while walling off our economy. Others say that the government needs to take a larger role in directing the economy, centralizing more power in Washington and increasing taxes. We hear claims that immigrants are somehow bad for the economy, even though this economy could not function without them. All these are forms of economic retreat, and they lead in the same direction: toward astagnant and second-rate economy. Tonight I will set out a better path: an agenda for a nation that competes with confidence, an agenda that will raise standards of living and generate new jobs. Americans should not fear our economic future, because we intend to shape it. Keeping America competitive begins with keeping our economy growing. And our economy grows when Americans have more of theirown money to spend, save and invest. In the last five years, the tax relief you passed has left $880 billion in the hands of American workers, investors, small businesses and families. And they have used it to help produce more than four years of uninterrupted economic growth. Yet the tax relief is set to expire in the next few years. If we do nothing, American families will face a massive tax increase they do not expect and will not welcome. Because America needs more than a temporary expansion, we need more than temporary tax relief. I urge the Congress to act responsibly and make thetax cuts permanent. Keeping America competitive requires us to be good stewards of tax dollars. Every year of my presidency, we've reduced the growth of nonsecurity discretionary spending. And last year you passed bills that cut this spending. This year my budget will cut it again and reduce or eliminate more than 140 programs that are performing poorly or not fulfilling essential priorities. By passing these reforms, we will save the American taxpayer another $14 billionnext year and stay on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009. I am pleased that the members of Congress are working on earmark reform, because the federal budget has too many special interest projects. And we can tackle this problemtogether, if you pass the line-item veto. We must also confront the larger challenge of mandatory spending, or entitlements. This year, the first of about 78 million baby boomers turns 60, including two of my dad's favorite people: me and President Clinton. This milestone is more than a personal crisis. It is a nationalchallenge. The retirement of the baby boom generation will put unprecedented strains on the federal government. By 2030, spending for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid alone will be almost 60 percent of the entire federal budget. And that will present future Congresses with impossible choices: staggering tax increases, immense deficits or deep cuts in every category of spending. Congress did not act last year on my proposal to save Social Security, yet the rising cost of entitlements is a problem that is not going away. And with every year we fail toact, the situation gets worse. So tonight I ask you to join me in creating a commission to examine the full impact of baby boom retirements on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. This commission should include members of Congress of both parties and offer bipartisan solutions. We need to put asidepartisan politics and work together and get this problem solved. Keeping America competitive requires us to open more markets for all that Americans make and grow. One out of every five factory jobs in America is related to global trade, and we want people everywhere to buy American. With open markets and a level playing field, no one canout- produce or out-compete the American worker. Keeping America competitive requires an immigration system that upholds our laws, reflects our values and serves the interests of our economy. Our nation needs orderly and secure borders. To meet this goal, we must have stronger immigration enforcement and border protection. And we must have a rational, humane guest worker program that rejects amnesty, allows temporary jobs for people who seek them legally, and reduces smuggling and crime atthe border. Keeping America competitive requires affordable health care. Our government has a responsibility to help provide health care for the poor and the elderly, and we are meeting that responsibility. For all Americans -- for all Americans -- we must confront the rising cost of care, strengthen the doctor-patient relationship, and help people afford the insurance coverage they need. We will make wider use of electronic records and other health information technology to help control costs and reduce dangerous medical errors. We will strengthen health savings accounts, making sure individuals and small-business employees can buy insurance with the same advantages that people working for big businesses now get. We will do more to make this coverage portable, so workers can switch jobs without having to worry about losing their health insurance. And because lawsuits are driving many good doctors out of practice -- leaving women in nearly 1,500 American counties without a single OB/GYN -- I ask theCongress to pass medical liability reform this year. Keeping America competitive requires affordable energy. And here we have a serious problem: America is addicted to oil, which is often imported from unstable parts of the world. The best way to break this addiction is through technology. Since 2001, we have spent nearly $10 billion to develop cleaner, cheaper and more reliable alternative energy sources. And weare on the threshold of incredible advances. So tonight I announce the Advanced Energy Initiative -- a 22 percent increase in clean-energy research at the Department of Energy to push for breakthroughs in two vital areas. To change how we power our homes and offices, we will invest more in zero-emission coal-fired plants; revolutionary solar and wind technologies; and clean, safe nuclear energy. We must also change how we power our automobiles. We will increase our research in better batteries forhybrid and electric cars and in pollution-free cars that run on hydrogen. We will also fund additional research in cutting-edge methods of producing ethanol, not just from corn but from wood chips and stalks or switch grass. Our goal is to make this new kind of ethanol practical and competitive within six years. Breakthroughs on this and other new technologies will help us reach another great goal: to replace more than 75 percent of our oil imports from the Middle East by 2025. By applying -- By applying the talent and technology of America, this country can dramatically improve our environment, move beyond a petroleum-based economy and make our dependence on Middle Eastern oil a thing of the past. And to keep America competitive, one commitment is necessary above all: We must continue to lead the world in human talent and creativity. Our greatest advantage in the world has always been our educated, hardworking, ambitious people, and we are going to keep that edge. Tonight I announce the American Competitiveness Initiative to encourage innovation throughout our economy and to give our nation's children a firm grounding in math andscience. First, I propose to double the federal commitment to the most critical basic research programs in the physical sciences over the next 10 years. This funding will support the work of America's most creative minds as they explore promising areas such as nanotechnology,supercomputing and alternative energy sources. Second, I propose to make permanent the research and development tax credit, to encourage bolder private-sector initiatives in technology. With more research in both the public and private sectors, we will improve our quality of life and ensure that America will lead the worldin opportunity and innovation for decades to come. Third, we need to encourage children to take more math and science, and to make sure those courses are rigorous enough to compete with other nations. We made a good start in the early grades with the No Child Left Behind Act, which is raising standards and lifting test scoresacross our country. Tonight I propose to train 70,000 high school teachers to lead advanced placement courses in math and science, bring 30,000 math and science professionals to teach in classrooms, and give early help to students who struggle with math so they have a better chance at good, high-wage jobs. If we ensure that America's children succeed in life, they will ensure that America succeeds in the world. Preparing our nation to compete in the world is a goal that all of us can share. I urge you to support the American Competitiveness Initiative and, together,we will show the world what the American people can achieve. America is a great force for freedom and prosperity. Yet our greatness is not measured in power or luxuries, but by who we are and how we treat one another. So we strive to be a compassionate, decent, hopeful society. In recent years, America has become a more hopeful nation. Violent crime rates have fallen to their lowest levels since the 1970s. Welfare cases have dropped by more than half over the past decade. Drug use among youth is down 19 percent since 2001. There are fewer abortions in America than at any point in the last three decades. And the number of children born to teenage mothers has been falling for a dozen years in a row. These gains are evidence of a quiet transformation, a revolution of conscience in which arising generation is finding that a life of personal responsibility is a life of fulfillment. Government has played a role. Wise policies such as welfare reform, and drug education, and support for abstinence and adoption have made a difference in the character of our country.And everyone here tonight, Democrat and Republican, has a right to be proud of this record. Yet many Americans, especially parents, still have deep concerns about the direction of our culture and the health of our most basic institutions. They are concerned about unethical conduct by public officials and discouraged by activist courts that try to redefine marriage. They worry about children in our society who need direction and love, and about fellow citizens still displaced by natural disaster, and about suffering caused by treatable diseases. As we look at these challenges, we must never give in to the belief that America is in decline or that our culture is doomed to unravel. The American people know better than that. Wehave proven the pessimists wrong before, and we will do it again. A hopeful society depends on courts that deliver equal justice under law. The Supreme Court now has two superb new members -- new members on its bench: Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Sam Alito. I thank the Senate for confirming both of them. I will continue to nominate men and women who understand that judges must be servants of the law and notlegislate from the bench. Today marks the official retirement of a very special American. For 24 years of faithful serviceto our nation, the United States is grateful to Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. A hopeful society has institutions of science and medicine that do not cut ethical corners and that recognize the matchless value of every life. Tonight I ask you to pass legislation to prohibit the most egregious abuses of medical research: human cloning in all its forms; creating or implanting embryos for experiments; creating human-animal hybrids; and buying, selling or patenting human embryos. Human life is a gift from our creator, and that gift shouldnever be discarded, devalued or put up for sale. A hopeful society expects elected officials to uphold the public trust. Honorable people in both parties are working on reforms to strengthen the ethical standards of Washington. I support your efforts. Each of us has made a pledge to be worthy of public responsibility, and that is apledge we must never forget, never dismiss and never betray. As we renew the promise of our institutions, let us also show the character of America in our compassion and care for one another. As we renew the promise of our institutions, let us alsoshow the character of America in our compassion and care for one another. A hopeful society gives special attention to children who lack direction and love. Through the Helping America's Youth Initiative, we are encouraging caring adults to get involved in the life of a child. And this good work is led by our first lady, Laura Bush. This year we will add resources to encourage young people to stay in school so more of America's youth can raisetheir sights and achieve their dreams. A hopeful society comes to the aid of fellow citizens in times of suffering and emergency and stays at it until they're back on their feet. So far, the federal government has committed $85 billion to the people of the Gulf Coast and New Orleans. We are removing debris and repairing highways and rebuilding stronger levees. We're providing business loans and housingassistance. Yet, as we meet these immediate needs, we must also address deeper challenges that existed before the storm arrived. In New Orleans and in other places, many of our fellow citizens have felt excluded from the promise of our country. The answer is not only temporary relief, but schools that teach every child, and job skills that bring upward mobility, and more opportunities to own a home and start a business. As we recover from a disaster, let us also work for the day when all Americans are protected by justice; equal in hope and rich inopportunity. A hopeful society acts boldly to fight diseases like HIV/AIDS, which can be prevented and treated and defeated. More than a million Americans live with HIV, and half of all AIDS cases occur among African-Americans. I ask Congress to reform and reauthorize the Ryan White Act and provide new funding to states so we end the waiting lists for AIDS medicines in America. We will also lead a nationwide effort, working closely with African-American churches and faith-based groups, to deliver rapid HIV tests to millions, end the stigma of AIDS and comecloser to the day when there are no new infections in America. Fellow citizens, we have been called to leadership in a period of consequence. We have entered a great ideological conflict we did nothing to invite. We see great changes in science and commerce that will influence all our lives. Sometimes it can seem that history is turning in a wide arc, toward an unknown shore. Yet the destination of history is determined by humanaction, and every great movement of history comes to a point of choosing. Lincoln could have accepted peace at the cost of disunity and continued slavery. Martin Luther King could have stopped at Birmingham or at Selma and achieved only half a victory over segregation. The United States could have accepted the permanent division of Europe andbeen complicit in the oppression of others. Today, having come far in our own historical journey, we must decide: Will we turn back or finish well? Before history is written down in books, it is written in courage. Like Americans before us, we will show that courage and we will finish well. We will lead freedom's advance. We will compete and excel in the global economy. We will renew the defining moral commitments of this land. And so we move forward optimistic about our country, faithful to itscause and confident of the victories to come. May God bless America.",bush
"The issue of immigration stirs intense emotions, and in recent weeks, Americans have seen those emotions on display. On the streets of major cities, crowds have rallied in support of those in our country illegally. At our southern border, others have organized to stop illegal immigrants from coming in. Across the country, Americans are trying to reconcile these contrasting images. And in Washington, the debate over immigration reform has reached a time of decision. Tonight, I will make it clear where I stand, and where I want to lead ourcountry on this vital issue. We must begin by recognizing the problems with our immigration system. For decades, the United States has not been in complete control of its borders. As a result, many who want towork in our economy have been able to sneak across our border, and millions have stayed. Once here, illegal immigrants live in the shadows of our society. Many use forged documents to get jobs, and that makes it difficult for employers to verify that the workers they hire are legal. Illegal immigration puts pressure on public schools and hospitals, it strains state and local budgets, and brings crime to our communities. These are real problems. Yet we must remember that the vast majority of illegal immigrants are decent people who work hard, support their families, practice their faith, and lead responsible lives. They are a part ofAmerican life, but they are beyond the reach and protection of American law. We're a nation of laws, and we must enforce our laws. We're also a nation of immigrants, and we must uphold that tradition, which has strengthened our country in so many ways. These are not contradictory goals. America can be a lawful society and a welcoming society at the same time. We will fix the problems created by illegal immigration, and we will deliver a system that is secure, orderly, and fair. So I support comprehensive immigration reform thatwill accomplish five clear objectives. First, the United States must secure its borders. This is a basic responsibility of a sovereign nation. It is also an urgent requirement of our national security. Our objective is straightforward: The border should be open to trade and lawful immigration, and shut toillegal immigrants, as well as criminals, drug dealers, and terrorists. I was a governor of a state that has a 1,200-mile border with Mexico. So I know how difficult it is to enforce the border, and how important it is. Since I became President, we've increased funding for border security by 66 percent, and expanded the Border Patrol from about 9,000 to 12,000 agents. The men and women of our Border Patrol are doing a fine job in difficult circumstances, and over the past five years, they have apprehended and sent home about sixmillion people entering America illegally. Despite this progress, we do not yet have full control of the border, and I am determined to change that. Tonight I'm calling on Congress to provide funding for dramatic improvements in manpower and technology at the border. By the end of 2008, we'll increase the number of Border Patrol officers by an additional 6,000. When these new agents are deployed, we'll havemore than doubled the size of the Border Patrol during my presidency. At the same time, we're launching the most technologically advanced border security initiative in American history. We will construct high-tech fences in urban corridors, and build new patrol roads and barriers in rural areas. We'll employ motion sensors, infrared cameras, and unmanned aerial vehicles to prevent illegal crossings. America has the best technology in the world, and we will ensure that the Border Patrol has the technology they need to do their joband secure our border. Training thousands of new Border Patrol agents and bringing the most advanced technology to the border will take time. Yet the need to secure our border is urgent. So I'm announcingseveral immediate steps to strengthen border enforcement during this period of transition: One way to help during this transition is to use the National Guard. So, in coordination with governors, up to 6,000 Guard members will be deployed to our southern border. The Border Patrol will remain in the lead. The Guard will assist the Border Patrol by operating surveillance systems, analyzing intelligence, installing fences and vehicle barriers, building patrol roads, and providing training. Guard units will not be involved in direct law enforcement activities -- that duty will be done by the Border Patrol. This initial commitment of Guard members would last for a period of one year. After that, the number of Guard forces will be reduced as new Border Patrol agents and new technologies come online. It is important for Americans to know that we have enough Guard forces to win the war on terror, to respond to natural disasters,and to help secure our border. The United States is not going to militarize the southern border. Mexico is our neighbor, and our friend. We will continue to work cooperatively to improve security on both sides of the border, to confront common problems like drug trafficking and crime, and to reduce illegalimmigration. Another way to help during this period of transition is through state and local law enforcement in our border communities. So we'll increase federal funding for state and local authorities assisting the Border Patrol on targeted enforcement missions. We will give state and local authorities the specialized training they need to help federal officers apprehend and detain illegal immigrants. State and local law enforcement officials are an important part of ourborder security and they need to be a part of our strategy to secure our borders. The steps I've outlined will improve our ability to catch people entering our country illegally. At the same time, we must ensure that every illegal immigrant we catch crossing our southern border is returned home. More than 85 percent of the illegal immigrants we catch crossing the southern border are Mexicans, and most are sent back home within 24 hours. But when we catch illegal immigrants from other country [sic] it is not as easy to send them home. For many years, the government did not have enough space in our detention facilities to hold them while the legal process unfolded. So most were released back into our society and asked to return for a court date. When the date arrived, the vast majority did not show up. Thispractice, called ""catch and release,"" is unacceptable, and we will end it. We're taking several important steps to meet this goal. We've expanded the number of beds in our detention facilities, and we will continue to add more. We've expedited the legal process to cut the average deportation time. And we're making it clear to foreign governments that they must accept back their citizens who violate our immigration laws. As a result of these actions, we've ended ""catch and release"" for illegal immigrants from some countries. And I will ask Congress for additional funding and legal authority, so we can end ""catch and release"" at the southern border once and for all. When people know that they'll be caught and sent homeif they enter our country illegally, they will be less likely to try to sneak in. Second, to secure our border, we must create a temporary worker program. The reality is that there are many people on the other side of our border who will do anything to come to America to work and build a better life. They walk across miles of desert in the summer heat, or hide in the back of 18-wheelers to reach our country. This creates enormous pressure on our border that walls and patrols alone will not stop. To secure the border effectively, we mustreduce the numbers of people trying to sneak across. Therefore, I support a temporary worker program that would create a legal path for foreign workers to enter our country in an orderly way, for a limited period of time. This program would match willing foreign workers with willing American employers for jobs Americans are not doing. Every worker who applies for the program would be required to pass criminal background checks. And temporary workers must return to their home country at theconclusion of their stay. A temporary worker program would meet the needs of our economy, and it would give honest immigrants a way to provide for their families while respecting the law. A temporary worker program would reduce the appeal of human smugglers, and make it less likely that people would risk their lives to cross the border. It would ease the financial burden on state and local governments, by replacing illegal workers with lawful taxpayers. And above all, a temporary worker program would add to our security by making certain we know who is in our countryand why they are here. Third, we need to hold employers to account for the workers they hire. It is against the law to hire someone who is in this country illegally. Yet businesses often cannot verify the legal status of their employees because of the widespread problem of document fraud. Therefore, comprehensive immigration reform must include a better system for verifying documents and work eligibility. A key part of that system should be a new identification card for every legal foreign worker. This card should use biometric technology, such as digital fingerprints, to make it tamper-proof. A tamper-proof card would help us enforce the law, and leave employers with no excuse for violating it. And by making it harder for illegal immigrants to find work in our country, we would discourage people from crossing the border illegally in thefirst place. Fourth, we must face the reality that millions of illegal immigrants are here already. They should not be given an automatic path to citizenship. This is amnesty, and I oppose it. Amnesty would be unfair to those who are here lawfully, and it would invite further waves ofillegal immigration. Some in this country argue that the solution is to deport every illegal immigrant, and that any proposal short of this amounts to amnesty. I disagree. It is neither wise, nor realistic to round up millions of people, many with deep roots in the United States, and send them across the border. There is a rational middle ground between granting an automatic path to citizenship for every illegal immigrant, and a program of mass deportation. That middle ground recognizes there are differences between an illegal immigrant who crossed the border recently, and someone who has worked here for many years, and has a home, a family, andan otherwise clean record. I believe that illegal immigrants who have roots in our country and want to stay should have to pay a meaningful penalty for breaking the law, to pay their taxes, to learn English, and to work in a job for a number of years. People who meet these conditions should be able to apply for citizenship, but approval would not be automatic, and they will have to wait in line behind those who played by the rules and followed the law. What I've just described is not amnesty, it is a way for those who have broken the law to pay their debt to society, and demonstratethe character that makes a good citizen. Fifth, we must honor the great American tradition of the melting pot, which has made us one nation out of many peoples. The success of our country depends upon helping newcomers assimilate into our society, and embrace our common identity as Americans. Americans are bound together by our shared ideals, an appreciation of our history, respect for the flag we fly, and an ability to speak and write the English language. English is also the key to unlocking the opportunity of America. English allows newcomers to go from picking crops to opening a grocery, from cleaning offices to running offices, from a life of low-paying jobs to a diploma, a career, and a home of their own. When immigrants assimilate and advance in our society,they realize their dreams, they renew our spirit, and they add to the unity of America. Tonight, I want to speak directly to members of the House and the Senate: An immigration reform bill needs to be comprehensive, because all elements of this problem must be addressed together, or none of them will be solved at all. The House has passed an immigration bill. The Senate should act by the end of this month so we can work out the differences between the two bills, and Congress can pass a comprehensive bill for me to signinto law. America needs to conduct this debate on immigration in a reasoned and respectful tone. Feelings run deep on this issue, and as we work it out, all of us need to keep some things in mind. We cannot build a unified country by inciting people to anger, or playing on anyone's fears, or exploiting the issue of immigration for political gain. We must always remember that real lives will be affected by our debates and decisions, and that every human being hasdignity and value no matter what their citizenship papers say. I know many of you listening tonight have a parent or a grandparent who came here from another country with dreams of a better life. You know what freedom meant to them, and you know that America is a more hopeful country because of their hard work and sacrifice. As President, I've had the opportunity to meet people of many backgrounds, and hear what America means to them. On a visit to Bethesda Naval Hospital, Laura and I met a wounded Marine named Guadalupe Denogean. Master Gunnery Sergeant Denogean came to the United States from Mexico when he was a boy. He spent his summers picking crops with his family, and then he volunteered for the United States Marine Corps as soon as he was able. During the liberation of Iraq, Master Gunnery Sergeant Denogean was seriously injured. And when asked if he had any requests, he made two: a promotion for the corporal who helped rescue him, and the chance to become an American citizen. And when this brave Marine raised his right hand, and swore an oath to become a citizen of the country he had defended for morethan 26 years, I was honored to stand at his side. We will always be proud to welcome people like Guadalupe Denogean as fellow Americans. Our new immigrants are just what they've always been -- people willing to risk everything for the dream of freedom. And America remains what she has always been: the great hope on the horizon, an open door to the future, a blessed and promised land. We honor the heritage of all who come here, no matter where they come from, because we trust in our country's geniusfor making us all Americans -- one nation under God. Thank you, and good night.",bush
"Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress: It's a great privilege to be here to outline a new budget and a new approach for governing our great country. I thank you for your invitation to speak here tonight. I know Congress had to formally invite me, and it couldhave been a close vote. So, Mr. Vice President, I appreciate you being here to break the tie. I want to thank so many of you who have accepted my invitation to come to the White House to discuss important issues. We're off to a good start. I will continue to meet with you and ask for your input. You have been kind and candid, and I thank you for making a new Presidentfeel welcome. The last time I visited the Capitol, I came to take an oath on the steps of this building. I pledged to honor our Constitution and laws. And I asked you to join me in setting a tone ofcivility and respect in Washington. I hope America is noticing the difference, because we're making progress. Together, we are changing the tone in the Nation's Capital. And this spirit of respect and cooperation is vital, because, in the end, we will be judged not only by what we say or how we say it, we will bejudged by what we're able to accomplish. America today is a nation with great challenges, but greater resources. An artist using statistics as a brush could paint two very different pictures of our country. One would have warning signs: increasing layoffs, rising energy prices, too many failing schools, persistent poverty, the stubborn vestiges of racism. Another picture would be full of blessings: a balanced budget, big surpluses, a military that is second to none, a country at peace with its neighbors, technology that is revolutionizing the world, and our greatest strength -- concernedcitizens who care for our country and care for each other. Neither picture is complete in and of itself. And tonight I challenge and invite Congress to work with me to use the resources of one picture to repaint the other; to direct the advantages of our time to solve the problems of our people. Some of these resources willcome from government. Some, but not all. Year after year in Washington, budget debates seem to come down to an old, tired argument: on one side, those who want more government, regardless of the cost; on the other, those who want less government, regardless of the need. We should leave those arguments to thelast century, and chart a different course. Government has a role, and an important role. Yet, too much government crowds out initiative and hard work, private charity and the private economy. Our new governing vision says government should be active, but limited; engaged, but not overbearing. And my budgetis based on that philosophy. It is reasonable, and it is responsible. It meets our obligations, and funds our growing needs. We increase spending next year for Social Security and Medicare, and other entitlement programs, by $81 billion. We've increased spending for discretionary programs by a very responsible 4 percent, above the rate of inflation. My plan pays down an unprecedented amount of our national debt. And then, when money is still left over, my plan returns it to thepeople who earned it in the first place. A budget's impact is counted in dollars, but measured in lives. Excellent schools, quality health care, a secure retirement, a cleaner environment, a stronger defense -- these are all important needs, and we fund them. The highest percentage increase in our budget should go to our children's education. Education is not my top priority -- education is my top priorityand, by supporting this budget, you'll make it yours, as well. Reading is the foundation of all learning. So during the next five years, we triple spending, adding $5 billion to help every child in America learn to read. Values are important, so we've tripled funding for character education to teach our children not only reading and writing, butright from wrong. We've increased funding to train and recruit teachers, because we know a good education starts with a good teacher. And I have a wonderful partner in this effort. I like teachers so much, I married one. Laura has begun a new effort to recruit Americans to the profession that will shape our future -- teaching. She will travel across America to promote sound teachingpractices and early reading skills in our schools and in programs such as Head Start. When it comes to our schools, dollars alone do not always make the difference. Funding is important, and so is reform. So we must tie funding to higher standards and accountability forresults. I believe in local control of schools. We should not, and we will not, run public schools from Washington, D.C. Yet when the federal government spends tax dollars, we must insist on results. Children should be tested on basic reading and math skills every year between grades three and eight. Measuring is the only way to know whether all our children are learning. AndI want to know, because I refuse to leave any child behind in America. Critics of testing contend it distracts from learning. They talk about teaching to the test. But let's put that logic to the test. If you test a child on basic math and reading skills, and you're teaching to the test, you're teaching math and reading. And that's the whole idea. As standards rise, local schools will need more flexibility to meet them. So we must streamline the dozens of federal education programs into five, and let states spend money in thosecategories as they see fit. Schools will be given a reasonable chance to improve and the support to do so. Yet, if they don't, if they continue to fail, we must give parents and students different options -- a better public school, a private school, tutoring or a charter school. In the end, every child in a bad situation must be given a better choice because, when it comes to our children, failure issimply not an option. Another priority in my budget is to keep the vital promises of Medicare and Social Security, and together we will do so. To meet the health care needs of all America's seniors, we double the Medicare budget over the next 10 years. My budget dedicates $238 billion to Medicare next year alone, enough to fund all current programs and to begin a new prescription drug benefit for low-income seniors. No senior in America should have to choose between buyingfood and buying prescriptions. To make sure the retirement savings of America's seniors are not diverted in any other program, my budget protects all $2.6 trillion of the Social Security surplus for Social Security,and for Social Security alone. My budget puts a priority on access to health care, without telling Americans what doctor they have to see or what coverage they must choose. Many working Americans do not have health care coverage, so we will help them buy their own insurance with refundable tax credits. And to provide quality care in low-income neighborhoods, over the next five years we will doublethe number of people served at community health care centers. And we will address the concerns of those who have health coverage, yet worry their insurance company doesn't care and won't pay. Together this Congress and this President will find common ground to make sure doctors make medical decisions, and patients get thehealth care they deserve with a patients' bill of rights. When it comes to their health, people want to get the medical care they need, not be forced to go to court because they didn't get it. We will ensure access to the courts for those with legitimate claims. But first, let's put in place a strong, independent review so we promotequality health care, not frivolous lawsuits. My budget also increases funding for medical research, which gives hope to many who struggle with serious disease. Our prayers tonight are with one of your own who is engaged in his own fight against cancer -- a fine representative, and a good man, Congressman Joe Moakley. I can think of no more appropriate tribute to Joe than to have the Congress finishthe job of doubling the budget for the National Institutes of Health. My new Freedom Initiative for Americans with Disabilities funds new technologies, expands opportunities to work, and makes our society more welcoming. For the more than 50 millionAmericans with disabilities, we need to break down barriers to equality. The budget I propose to you also supports the people who keep our country strong and free, the men and women who serve in the United States military. I'm requesting $5.7 billion in increased military pay and benefits, and health care and housing. Our men and women inuniform give America their best and we owe them our support. America's veterans honored their commitment to our country through their military service. I will honor our commitment to them with a million-dollar increase to ensure better access toquality care and faster decisions on benefit claims. My budget will improve our environment by accelerating the cleanup of toxic brownfields. And I propose we make a major investment in conservation by fully funding the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Our national parks have a special place in our country's life. Our parks are places of great natural beauty and history. As good stewards, we must leave them better than we found them. So I propose providing $4.9 billion over five years for the upkeep of thesenational treasures. And my budget adopts a hopeful new approach to help the poor and the disadvantaged. We must encourage and support the work of charities and faith-based and community groups that offer help and love one person at a time. These groups are working in every neighborhood in America to fight homelessness and addiction and domestic violence; to provide a hot meal or a mentor or a safe haven for our children. Government should welcome these groups to applyfor funds, not discriminate against them. Government cannot be replaced by charities or volunteers. Government should not fund religious activities. But our nation should support the good works of these good people who are helping their neighbors in need. So I propose allowing all taxpayers, whether they itemize or not, to deduct their charitable contributions. Estimates show this could encourage as muchas $14 billion a year in new charitable giving, money that will save and change lives. Our budget provides more than $700 million over the next 10 years for a federal compassion capital fund, with a focused and noble mission, to provide a mentor to the more than 100 million children with a parent in prison, and to support other local efforts to fight illiteracy,teen pregnancy, drug addiction and other difficult problems. With us tonight is the Mayor of Philadelphia. Please help me welcome Mayor John Street. Mayor Street has encouraged faith-based and community organizations to make a significant difference in Philadelphia. He's invited me to his city this summer to see compassionate action. I'm personally aware of just how effective the Mayor is. Mayor Street's a Democrat. Let the record show, I lost his city, big time. But some things are bigger than politics. So Ilook forward to coming to your city, to see your faith-based programs in action. As government promotes compassion, it also must promote justice. Too many of our citizens have cause to doubt our nation's justice, when the law points a finger of suspicion at groups,instead of individuals. All our citizens are created equal, and must be treated equally. Earlier today, I asked John Ashcroft, the Attorney General, to develop specific recommendations to end racial profiling. It's wrong and we will end it in America. In so doing, we will not hinder the work of our nation's brave police officers. They protect us every day -- often at great risk. But by stopping the abuses of a few, we will add to the public confidenceour police officers earn and deserve. My budget has funded a responsible increase in our ongoing operations. It has funded our nation's important priorities. It has protected Social Security and Medicare. And our surplusesare big enough that there is still money left over. Many of you have talked about the need to pay down our national debt. I listened, and I agree. We owe it to our children and grandchildren to act now, and I hope you will join me to pay down $2 trillion in debt during the next 10 years. At the end of those 10 years, we will have paid down all the debt that is available to retire. That is more debt, repaid more quickly than has ever been repaid by any nation at any time inhistory. We should also prepare for the unexpected, for the uncertainties of the future. We should approach our nation's budget as any prudent family would, with a contingency fund for emergencies or additional spending needs. For example, after a strategic review, we may need to increase defense spending. We may need to increase spending for our farmers or additional money to reform Medicare. And so, my budget sets aside almost a trillion dollars over 10 years for additional needs. That is one trillion additional reasons you can feelcomfortable supporting this budget. We have increased our budget at a responsible 4 percent. We have funded our priorities. We paid down all the available debt. We have prepared for contingencies. And we still havemoney left over. Yogi Berra once said, ""When you come to a fork in the road, take it."" Now, we come to a fork in the road; we have two choices. Even though we have already met our needs, we could spend the money on more and bigger government. That's the road our nation has traveled inrecent years. Last year, government spending shot up 8 percent. That's far more than our economy grew, far more than personal income grew, and far more than the rate of inflation. If you continue on that road, you will spend the surplus and have to dip into Social Security to pay other bills. Unrestrained government spending is a dangerous road to deficits, so we must take a different path. The other choice is to let the American people spend their own money to meettheir own needs. I hope you will join me in standing firmly on the side of the people. You see, the growing surplus exists because taxes are too high and government is charging more than it needs. Thepeople of America have been overcharged and, on their behalf, I am here asking for a refund. Some say my tax plan is too big. Others say it's too small. I respectfully disagree. This plan is just right. I didn't throw darts at the board to come up with a number for tax relief. I didn't take a poll or develop an arbitrary formula that might sound good. I looked at problems in theTax Code and calculated the cost to fix them. A tax rate of 15 percent is too high for those who earn low wages, so we must lower the rate to 10 percent. No one should pay more than a third of the money they earn in federal incometaxes, so we lowered the top rate to 33 percent. This reform will be welcome relief for America's small businesses, which often pay taxes at the highest rate. And help for small business means jobs for Americans. We simplified the Tax Code by reducing the number of tax rates from the current five rates to four lower ones, 10 percent, 15, 25 and 33 percent. In my plan, no one is targeted in or targeted out. Everyonewho pays income taxes will get relief. Our government should not tax, and thereby discourage marriage, so we reduced the marriage penalty. I want to help families rear and support their children, so we doubled the child credit to $1,000 per child. It's not fair to tax the same earnings twice -- once when youearn them, and again when you die -- so we must repeal the death tax. These changes add up to significant help. A typical family with two children will save $1,600 a year on their federal income taxes. Now, $1,600 may not sound like a lot to some, but it means a lot to many families: $1,600 buys gas for two cars for an entire year; it pays tuition for a year at a community college; it pays the average family grocery bill for three months.That's real money. With us tonight representing many American families are Steven and Josefina Ramos. They are from Pennsylvania. But they could be from any one of your districts. Steven is the network administrator for a school district. Josefina is a Spanish teacher at a charter school. And theyhave a two-year-old daughter. Steven and Josefina tell me they pay almost $8,000 a year in federal income taxes. My plan will save them more than $2,000. Let me tell you what Steven says: ""Two thousand dollars a year means a lot to my family. If we had this money, it would help us reach our goal of paying off our personal debt in two years' time."" After that, Steven and Josefina want to start saving for Lianna's collegeeducation. My attitude is, government should never stand in the way of families achieving their dreams. And as we debate this issue, always remember, the surplus is not the government's money,the surplus is the people's money. For lower-income families, my tax plan restores basic fairness. Right now, complicated tax rules punish hard work. A waitress supporting two children on $25,000 a year can lose nearly half of every additional dollar she earns above the $25,000. Her overtime, her hardest hours, are taxed at nearly 20 percent. This sends a terrible message: you'll never get ahead. But America's message must be different. We must honor hard work, never punish it. With tax relief, overtime will no longer be over-taxed time for the waitress. People with the smallest incomes will get the highest percentage of reductions. And millions of additional Americanfamilies will be removed from the income tax rolls entirely. Tax relief is right and tax relief is urgent. The long economic expansion that began almost 10 years ago is faltering. Lower interest rates will eventually help, but we cannot assume theywill do the job all by themselves. Forty years ago, and then 20 years ago, two Presidents, one Democrat, one Republican, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, advocated tax cuts to, in President Kennedy's words, get this country moving again. They knew then what we must do now. To create economic growth and opportunity, we must put money back into the hands of the people who buy goods and createjobs. We must act quickly. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve has testified before Congress that tax cuts often come too late to stimulate economic recovery. So I want to work with you togive our economy an important jump-start by making tax relief retroactive. We must act now because it is the right thing to do. We must also act now because we have other things to do. We must show courage to confront and resolve tough challenges, to restructure our nation's defenses, to meet our growing need for energy, and to reformMedicare and Social Security. America has a window of opportunity to extend and secure our present peace by promoting a distinctly American internationalism. We will work with our allies and friends to be a force for good and a champion of freedom. We will work for free markets, free trade and freedom from oppression. Nations making progress toward freedom will find America is their friend. We will promote our values. We will promote the peace. And we need a strong military to keep thepeace. But our military was shaped to confront the challenges of the past. So I've asked the Secretary of Defense to review America's Armed Forces and prepare to transform them to meet emerging threats. My budget makes a down payment on the research and development that will be required. Yet, in our broader transformation effort, we must put strategy first,then spending. Our defense vision will drive our defense budget, not the other way around. Our nation also needs a clear strategy to confront the threats of the 21st century -- threats that are more widespread and less certain. They range from terrorists who threaten with bombs to tyrants in rogue nations intent upon developing weapons of mass destruction. To protect our own people, our allies and friends, we must develop and we must deploy effectivemissile defenses. And as we transform our military, we can discard Cold War relics, and reduce our own nuclear forces to reflect today's needs. A strong America is the world's best hope for peace andfreedom. Yet the cause of freedom rests on more than our ability to defend ourselves and our allies. Freedom is exported every day, as we ship goods and products that improve the lives of millions of people. Free trade brings greater political and personal freedom. Each of the previous five Presidents has had the ability to negotiate far reaching trade agreements. Tonight I ask you to give me the strong hand of presidential trade promotion authority, and todo so quickly. As we meet tonight, many citizens are struggling with the high cost of energy. We have a serious energy problem that demands a national energy policy. The West is confronting a major energy shortage that has resulted in high prices and uncertainty. I've asked federal agencies to work with California officials to help speed construction of new energy sources, and I have direct Vice President Cheney, Commerce Secretary Evans, Energy Secretary Abraham and other senior members in my administration to develop a nationalenergy policy. Our energy demand outstrips our supply. We can produce more energy at home while protecting our environment, and we must. We can produce more electricity to meet demand, and we must. We can promote alternative energy sources and conservation, and we must.America must become more energy-independent, and we will. Perhaps the biggest test of our foresight and courage will be reforming Medicare and Social Security. Medicare's finances are strained and its coverage is outdated. Ninety-nine percent of employer-provided health plans offer some form of prescription drug coverage; Medicare does not. The framework for reform has been developed by Senators Frist and Breaux andCongressman Thomas, and now is the time to act. Medicare must be modernized, and we must make sure that every senior on Medicare canchoose a health care plan that offers prescription drugs. Seven years from now, the baby boom generation will begin to claim Social Security benefits. Every one in this chamber knows that Social Security is not prepared to fully fund their retirement. And we only have a couple of years to get prepared. Without reform, this country will one day awaken to a stark choice: either a drastic rise in payroll taxes or a radical cut inretirement benefits. There is a better way. This spring I will form a presidential commission to reform Social Security. The commission will make its recommendations by next fall. Reform should be based on these principles: It must preserve the benefits of all current retirees and those nearing retirement. It must return Social Security to sound financial footing. And it must offerpersonal savings accounts to younger workers who want them. Social Security now offers workers a return of less than 2 percent on the money they pay into the system. To save the system, we must increase that by allowing younger workers to make safe, sound investments that yield a higher rate of return. Ownership, access to wealth and independence should not be the privilege of the few. Theyare the hope of every American, and we must make them the foundation of Social Security. By confronting the tough challenge of reform, by being responsible with our budget, we can earn the trust of the American people. And we can add to that trust by enacting fair andbalanced election and campaign reforms. The agenda I have set before you tonight is worthy of a great nation. America is a nation at peace, but not a nation at rest. Much has been given to us, and much is expected. Let us agree to bridge old divides. But let us also agree that our goodwill must be dedicated to greatgoals. Bipartisan is more than minding our matters. It is doing our duty. No one can speak in this Capitol and not be awed by its history. As so many turning points, debates in these chambers have reflected the collected or divided conscience of our country. And when we walk through Statuary Hall and see those men and women of marble, we'rereminded of their courage and achievement. Yet America's purpose is never found only in statues or history. America's purpose always stands before us. Our generation must show courage in a time of blessing, as our nation has always shown in times of crisis. And our courage, issue by issue, can gather to greatness and serve our country. This is the privilege and responsibility we share. And if we work together,we can prove that public service is noble. We all came here for a reason. We all have things we want to accomplish and promises tokeep. Juntos podemos -- together we can. We can make Americans proud of their government. Together we can share in the credit of making our country more prosperous and generous and just, and earn from our conscienceand from our fellow citizens the highest possible praise: Well done, good and faithful servants. Thank you all. Good night and God bless.",bush
"Ambassador Negroponte, General Hayden, members of the United States Congress, familieswho lost loved ones in the terrorist attacks on our nation, and my fellow citizens: Thanks forcoming. On the morning of September the 11th, 2001, our nation awoke to a nightmare attack.Nineteen men, armed with box cutters, took control of airplanes and turned them into missiles. They used them to kill nearly 3,000 innocent people. We watched the Twin Towerscollapse before our eyes -- and it became instantly clear that we'd entered a new world, and adangerous new war. The attacks of September the 11th horrified our nation. And amid the grief came new fears and urgent questions: Who had attacked us? What did they want? And what else were theyplanning? Americans saw the destruction the terrorists had caused in New York, and Washington, and Pennsylvania, and they wondered if there were other terrorist cells in ourmidst poised to strike; they wondered if there was a second wave of attacks still to come. With the Twin Towers and the Pentagon still smoldering, our country on edge, and a stream ofintelligence coming in about potential new attacks, my Administration faced immediate challenges: We had to respond to the attack on our country. We had to wage anunprecedented war against an enemy unlike any we had fought before. We had to find the terrorists hiding in America and across the world, before they were able to strike our countryagain. So in the early days and weeks after 9/11, I directed our government's senior nationalsecurity officials to do everything in their power, within our laws, to prevent another attack. Nearly five years have passed since these -- those initial days of shock and sadness -- and weare thankful that the terrorists have not succeeded in launching another attack on our soil. This is not for the lack of desire or determination on the part of the enemy. As the recently foiled plot in London shows, the terrorists are still active, and they're still trying to strikeAmerica, and they're still trying to kill our people. One reason the terrorists have not succeeded is because of the hard work of thousands of dedicated men and women in ourgovernment, who have toiled day and night, along with our allies, to stop the enemy fromcarrying out their plans. And we are grateful for these hardworking citizens of ours. Another reason the terrorists have not succeeded is because our government has changed itspolicies -- and given our military, intelligence, and law enforcement personnel the tools theyneed to fight this enemy and protect our people and preserve our freedoms. The terrorists who declared war on America represent no nation, they defend no territory, and they wear no uniform. They do not mass armies on borders, or flotillas of warships on thehigh seas. They operate in the shadows of society; they send small teams of operatives to infiltrate free nations; they live quietly among their victims; they conspire in secret, and thenthey strike without warning. In this new war, the most important source of information on where the terrorists are hiding and what they are planning is the terrorists, themselves.Captured terrorists have unique knowledge about how terrorist networks operate. They have knowledge of where their operatives are deployed, and knowledge about what plots areunderway. This intelligence -- this is intelligence that cannot be found any other place. And our security depends on getting this kind of information. To win the war on terror, we must beable to detain, question, and, when appropriate, prosecute terrorists captured here inAmerica, and on the battlefields around the world. After the 9/11 attacks, our coalition launched operations across the world to remove terrorist safe havens, and capture or kill terrorist operatives and leaders. Working with our allies, we've captured and detained thousands of terrorists and enemyfighters in Afghanistan, in Iraq, and other fronts of this war on terror. These enemy -- these are enemy combatants, who were waging war on our nation. We have a right under the lawsof war, and we have an obligation to the American people, to detain these enemies and stopthem from rejoining the battle. Most of the enemy combatants we capture are held in Afghanistan or in Iraq, where they'requestioned by our military personnel. Many are released after questioning, or turned over to local authorities -- if we determine that they do not pose a continuing threat and no longerhave significant intelligence value. Others remain in American custody near the battlefield, toensure that they don't return to the fight. In some cases, we determine that individuals we have captured pose a significant threat, or may have intelligence that we and our allies need to have to prevent new attacks. Many are alQaeda operatives or Taliban fighters trying to conceal their identities, and they withhold information that could save American lives. In these cases, it has been necessary to movethese individuals to an environment where they can be held secretly [sic], questioned byexperts, and -- when appropriate -- prosecuted for terrorist acts. Some of these individuals are taken to the United States Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. It's important for Americans and others across the world to understand the kind ofpeople held at Guantanamo. These aren't common criminals, or bystanders accidentally swept up on the battlefield -- we have in place a rigorous process to ensure those held atGuantanamo Bay belong at Guantanamo. Those held at Guantanamo include suspected bomb makers, terrorist trainers, recruiters and facilitators, and potential suicide bombers. They arein our custody so they cannot murder our people. One detainee held at Guantanamo told a questioner questioning him -- he said this: ""I'll never forget your face. I will kill you, yourbrothers, your mother, and sisters."" In addition to the terrorists held at Guantanamo, a small number of suspected terroristleaders and operatives captured during the war have been held and questioned outside the United States, in a separate program operated by the Central Intelligence Agency. This groupincludes individuals believed to be the key architects of the September the 11th attacks, and attacks on the USS Cole, an operative involved in the bombings of our embassies in Kenyaand Tanzania, and individuals involved in other attacks that have taken the lives of innocent civilians across the world. These are dangerous men with unparalleled knowledge aboutterrorist networks and their plans for new attacks. The security of our nation and the lives ofour citizens depend on our ability to learn what these terrorists know. Many specifics of this program, including where these detainees have been held and thedetails of their confinement, cannot be divulged. Doing so would provide our enemies with information they could use to take retribution against our allies and harm our country. I cansay that questioning the detainees in this program has given us information that has saved innocent lives by helping us stop new attacks -- here in the United States and across theworld. Today, I'm going to share with you some of the examples provided by our intelligence community of how this program has saved lives; why it remains vital to the security of theUnited States, and our friends and allies; and why it deserves the support of the United StatesCongress and the American people. Within months of September the 11th, 2001, we captured a man known as Abu Zubaydah. We believe that Zubaydah was a senior terrorist leader and a trusted associate of Osama binLaden. Our intelligence community believes he had run a terrorist camp in Afghanistan where some of the 9/11 hijackers trained, and that he helped smuggle al Qaeda leaders out ofAfghanistan after coalition forces arrived to liberate that country. Zubaydah was severely wounded during the firefight that brought him into custody -- and he survived only because ofthe medical care arranged by the CIA. After he recovered, Zubaydah was defiant and evasive. He declared his hatred of America. During questioning, he at first disclosed what he thought was nominal information -- and thenstopped all cooperation. Well, in fact, the ""nominal"" information he gave us turned out to be quite important. For example, Zubaydah disclosed Khalid Sheikh Mohammed -- or KSM -- was the mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks, and used the alias ""Muktar."" This was a vital piece ofthe puzzle that helped our intelligence community pursue KSM. Abu Zubaydah also provided information that helped stop a terrorist attack being planned for inside the United States -- anattack about which we had no previous information. Zubaydah told us that al Qaeda operatives were planning to launch an attack in the U.S., and provided physical descriptions ofthe operatives and information on their general location. Based on the information heprovided, the operatives were detained -- one while traveling to the United States. We knew that Zubaydah had more information that could save innocent lives, but he stoppedtalking. As his questioning proceeded, it became clear that he had received training on how to resist interrogation. And so the CIA used an alternative set of procedures. These procedures were designed to be safe, to comply with our laws, our Constitution, and our treatyobligations. The Department of Justice reviewed the authorized methods extensively and determined them to be lawful. I cannot describe the specific methods used -- I think you understand why -- if I did, it wouldhelp the terrorists learn how to resist questioning, and to keep information from us that we need to prevent new attacks on our country. But I can say the procedures were tough, andthey were safe, and lawful, and necessary. Zubaydah was questioned using these procedures, and soon he began to provide information on key al Qaeda operatives, including information that helped us find and capture more ofthose responsible for the attacks on September the 11th. For example, Zubaydah identified one of KSM's accomplices in the 9/11 attacks -- a terrorist named Ramzi bin al Shibh. Theinformation Zubaydah provided helped lead to the capture of bin al Shibh. And together these two terrorists provided information that helped in the planning and execution of the operationthat captured Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. Once in our custody, KSM was questioned by the CIA using these procedures, and he soonprovided information that helped us stop another planned attack on the United States. During questioning, KSM told us about another al Qaeda operative he knew was in CIA custody -- aterrorist named Majid Khan. KSM revealed that Khan had been told to deliver $50,000 to individuals working for a suspected terrorist leader named Hambali, the leader of al Qaeda'sSoutheast Asian affiliate known as ""J-I"". CIA officers confronted Khan with this information. Khan confirmed that the money had been delivered to an operative named Zubair, andprovided both a physical description and contact number for this operative. Based on that information, Zubair was captured in June of 2003, and he soon providedinformation that helped lead to the capture of Hambali. After Hambali's arrest, KSM was questioned again. He identified Hambali's brother as the leader of a ""J-I"" cell, and Hambali'sconduit for communications with al Qaeda. Hambali's brother was soon captured in Pakistan, and, in turn, led us to a cell of 17 Southeast Asian ""J-I"" operatives. When confronted with thenews that his terror cell had been broken up, Hambali admitted that the operatives were being groomed at KSM's request for attacks inside the United States -- probably [sic] usingairplanes. During questioning, KSM also provided many details of other plots to kill innocent Americans.For example, he described the design of planned attacks on buildings inside the United States, and how operatives were directed to carry them out. He told us the operatives had beeninstructed to ensure that the explosives went off at a point that was high enough to preventthe people trapped above from escaping out the windows. KSM also provided vital information on al Qaeda's efforts to obtain biological weapons. Duringquestioning, KSM admitted that he had met three individuals involved in al Qaeda's efforts to produce anthrax, a deadly biological agent -- and he identified one of the individuals as aterrorist named Yazid. KSM apparently believed we already had this information, because Yazid had been captured and taken into foreign custody before KSM's arrest. In fact, we didnot know about Yazid's role in al Qaeda's anthrax program. Information from Yazid then helped lead to the capture of his two principal assistants in the anthrax program. Without theinformation provided by KSM and Yazid, we might not have uncovered this al Qaeda biological weapons program, or stopped this al Qaeda cell from developing anthrax for attacks againstthe United States. These are some of the plots that have been stopped because of the information of this vitalprogram. Terrorists held in CIA custody have also provided information that helped stop a planned strike on U.S. Marines at Camp Lemonier in Djibouti -- they were going to use anexplosive laden water tanker. They helped stop a planned attack on the U.S. consulate in Karachi using car bombs and motorcycle bombs, and they helped stop a plot to hijackpassenger planes and fly them into Heathrow or the Canary Wharf in London. We're getting vital information necessary to do our jobs, and that's to protect the Americanpeople and our allies. Information from the terrorists in this program has helped us to identify individuals that al Qaeda deemed suitable for Western operations, many of whom we had never heard aboutbefore. They include terrorists who were set to case targets inside the United States, including financial buildings in major cities on the East Coast. Information from terrorists in CIA custodyhas played a role in the capture or questioning of nearly every senior al Qaeda member or associate detained by the U.S. and its allies since this program began. By providing everythingfrom initial leads to photo identifications, to precise locations of where terrorists were hiding, this program has helped us to take potential mass murderers off the streets before they wereable to kill. This program has also played a critical role in helping us understand the enemy we face in thiswar. Terrorists in this program have painted a picture of al Qaeda's structure and financing, and communications and logistics. They identified al Qaeda's travel routes and safe havens,and explained how al Qaeda's senior leadership communicates with its operatives in places like Iraq. They provided information that allows us -- that has allowed us to make sense of documentsand computer records that we have seized in terrorist raids. They've identified voices in recordings of intercepted calls, and helped us understand the meaning of potentially criticalterrorist communications. The information we get from these detainees is corroborated by intelligence, and we've received -- that we've received from other sources -- and together this intelligence has helpedus connect the dots and stop attacks before they occur. Information from the terrorists questioned in this program helped unravel plots and terrorist cells in Europe and in otherplaces. It's helped our allies protect their people from deadly enemies. This program has been, and remains, one of the most vital tools in our war against the terrorists. It is invaluable to America and to our allies. Were it not for this program, our intelligence community believesthat al Qaeda and its allies would have succeeded in launching another attack against the American homeland. By giving us information about terrorist plans we could not get anywhereelse, this program has saved innocent lives. This program has been subject to multiple legal reviews by the Department of Justice and CIA lawyers; they've determined it complied with our laws. This program has received strictoversight by the CIA's Inspector General. A small number of key leaders from both political parties on Capitol Hill were briefed about this program. All those involved in the questioning ofthe terrorists are carefully chosen and they're screened from a pool of experienced CIA officers. Those selected to conduct the most sensitive questioning had to complete more than 250 additional hours of specialized training before they are allowed to have contact with acaptured terrorist. I want to be absolutely clear with our people, and the world: The United States does not torture. It's against our laws, and it's against our values. I have not authorized it -- and I willnot authorize it. Last year, my Administration worked with Senator John McCain, and I signed into law the Detainee Treatment Act, which established the legal standard for treatment ofdetainees wherever they are held. I support this act. And as we implement this law, our government will continue to use every lawful method to obtain intelligence that can protectinnocent people, and stop another attack like the one we experienced on September the 11th,2001. The CIA program has detained only a limited number of terrorists at any given time -- and once we've determined that the terrorists held by the CIA have little or no additionalintelligence value, many of them have been returned to their home countries for prosecution or detention by their governments. Others have been accused of terrible crimes against the American people, and we have a dutyto bring those responsible for these crimes to justice. So we intend to prosecute these men,as appropriate, for their crimes. Soon after the war on terror began, I authorized a system of military commissions to tryforeign terrorists accused of war crimes. Military commissions have been used by Presidents from George Washington to Franklin Roosevelt to prosecute war criminals, because the rulesfor trying enemy combatants in a time of conflict must be different from those for trying common criminals or members of our own military. One of the first suspected terrorists to beput on trial by military commission was one of Osama bin Laden's bodyguards -- a man named Hamdan. His lawyers challenged the legality of the military commission system. It took more than two years for this case to make its way through the courts. The Court of Appealsfor the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the military commissions we had designed, but this past June, the Supreme Court overturned that decision. The Supreme Court determined thatmilitary commissions are an appropriate venue for trying terrorists, but ruled that militarycommissions needed to be explicitly authorized by the United States Congress. So today, I'm sending Congress legislation to specifically authorize the creation of militarycommissions to try terrorists for war crimes. My Administration has been working with members of both parties in the House and Senate on this legislation. We put forward a billthat ensures these commissions are established in a way that protects our national security, and ensures a full and fair trial for those accused. The procedures in the bill I am sending to Congress today reflect the reality that we are a nation at war, and that it's essential for us touse all reliable evidence to bring these people to justice. We're now approaching the five-year anniversary of the 9/11 attacks -- and the families of those murdered that day have waited patiently for justice. Some of the families are with ustoday -- they should have to wait no longer. So I'm announcing today that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Abu Zubaydah, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, and 11 other terrorists in CIA custody havebeen transferred to the United States Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay. They are being held in the custody of the Department of Defense. As soon as Congress acts to authorize the militarycommissions I have proposed, the men our intelligence officials believe orchestrated thedeaths of nearly 3,000 Americans on September the 11th, 2001, can face justice. We'll also seek to prosecute those believed to be responsible for the attack on the USS Cole, and an operative believed to be involved in the bombings of the American embassies in Kenyaand Tanzania. With these prosecutions, we will send a clear message to those who killAmericans: No longer -- how long it takes, we will find you and we will bring you to justice. These men will be held in a high-security facility at Guantanamo. The International Committeeof the Red Cross is being advised of their detention, and will have the opportunity to meet with them. Those charged with crimes will be given access to attorneys who will help themprepare their defense -- and they will be presumed innocent. While at Guantanamo, they will have access to the same food, clothing, medical care, and opportunities for worship as otherdetainees. They will be questioned subject to the new U.S. Army Field Manual, which the Department of Defense is issuing today. And they will continue to be treated with thehumanity that they denied others. As we move forward with the prosecutions, we will continue to urge nations across the world to take back their nationals at Guantanamo who will not be prosecuted by our military commissions. America has no interest in being the world's jailer. But one of the reasons wehave not been able to close Guantanamo is that many countries have refused to take back their nationals held at the facility. Other countries have not provided adequate assurancesthat their nationals will not be mistreated -- or they will not return to the battlefield, as more than a dozen people released from Guantanamo already have. We will continue working totransfer individuals held at Guantanamo, and ask other countries to work with us in this process. And we will move toward the day when we can eventually close the detention facilityat Guantanamo Bay. I know Americans have heard conflicting information about Guantanamo. Let me give you some facts. Of the thousands of terrorists captured across the world, only about 770 have ever been sent to Guantanamo. Of these, about 315 have been returned to other countries sofar -- and about 455 remain in our custody. They are provided the same quality of medical care as the American service members who guard them. The International Committee of theRed Cross has the opportunity to meet privately with all who are held there. The facility has been visited by government officials from more than 30 countries, and delegations frominternational organizations, as well. After the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe came to visit, one of its delegation members called Guantanamo ""a model prison""where people are treated better than in prisons in his own country. Our troops can take greatpride in the work they do at Guantanamo Bay -- and so can the American people. As we prosecute suspected terrorist leaders and operatives who have now been transferred to Guantanamo, we'll continue searching for those who have stepped forward to take theirplaces. This nation is going to stay on the offense to protect the American people. We will continue to bring the world's most dangerous terrorists to justice -- and we will continueworking to collect the vital intelligence we need to protect our country. The current transfers mean that there are now no terrorists in the CIA program. But as morehigh-ranking terrorists are captured, the need to obtain intelligence from them will remain critical -- and having a CIA program for questioning terrorists will continue to be crucial togetting life-saving information. Some may ask: Why are you acknowledging this program now? There are two reasons why I'm making these limited disclosures today. First, we have largely completed our questioningof the men -- and to start the process for bringing them to trial, we must bring them into the open. Second, the Supreme Court's recent decision has impaired our ability to prosecuteterrorists through military commissions, and has put in question the future of the CIA program. In its ruling on military commissions, the Court determined that a provision of the Geneva Conventions known as ""Common Article Three"" applies to our war with al Qaeda. Thisarticle includes provisions that prohibit ""outrages upon personal dignity"" and ""humiliating and degrading treatment."" The problem is that these and other provisions of Common ArticleThree are vague and undefined, and each could be interpreted in different ways by American or foreign judges. And some believe our military and intelligence personnel involved incapturing and questioning terrorists could now be at risk of prosecution under the War CrimesAct -- simply for doing their jobs in a thorough and professional way. This is unacceptable. Our military and intelligence personnel go face to face with the world'smost dangerous men every day. They have risked their lives to capture some of the most brutal terrorists on Earth. And they have worked day and night to find out what the terrorists know so we can stop new attacks. America owes our brave men and women some things inreturn. We owe them their thanks for saving lives and keeping America safe. And we owethem clear rules, so they can continue to do their jobs and protect our people. So today, I'm asking Congress to pass legislation that will clarify the rules for our personnelfighting the war on terror. First, I'm asking Congress to list the specific, recognizable offenses that would be considered crimes under the War Crimes Act -- so our personnel can knowclearly what is prohibited in the handling of terrorist enemies. Second, I'm asking that Congress make explicit that by following the standards of the Detainee Treatment Act ourpersonnel are fulfilling America's obligations under Common Article Three of the Geneva Conventions. Third, I'm asking that Congress make it clear that captured terrorists cannot use the Geneva Conventions as a basis to sue our personnel in courts -- in U.S. courts. The menand women who protect us should not have to fear lawsuits filed by terrorists because they'redoing their jobs. The need for this legislation is urgent. We need to ensure that those questioning terrorists cancontinue to do everything within the limits of the law to get information that can save American lives. My Administration will continue to work with the Congress to get thislegislation enacted -- but time is of the essence. Congress is in session just for a few moreweeks, and passing this legislation ought to be the top priority. As we work with Congress to pass a good bill, we will also consult with congressional leaderson how to ensure that the CIA program goes forward in a way that follows the law, that meets the national security needs of our country, and protects the brave men and women we ask toobtain information that will save innocent lives. For the sake of our security, Congress needsto act, and update our laws to meet the threats of this new era. And I know they will. We're engaged in a global struggle -- and the entire civilized world has a stake in its outcome. America is a nation of law. And as I work with Congress to strengthen and clarify our lawshere at home, I will continue to work with members of the international community who have been our partners in this struggle. I've spoken with leaders of foreign governments, andworked with them to address their concerns about Guantanamo and our detention policies. I'll continue to work with the international community to construct a common foundation todefend our nations and protect our freedoms. Free nations have faced new enemies and adjusted to new threats before -- and we haveprevailed. Like the struggles of the last century, today's war on terror is, above all, a struggle for freedom and liberty. The adversaries are different, but the stakes in this war are thesame: We're fighting for our way of life, and our ability to live in freedom. We're fighting for the cause of humanity, against those who seek to impose the darkness of tyranny and terrorupon the entire world. And we're fighting for a peaceful future for our children and ourgrandchildren. May God bless you all.",bush
"memory. Nineteen men attacked us with a barbarity unequaled in our history. They murdered people of all colors, creeds, and nationalities -- and made war upon the entire free world. Since that day, America and her allies have taken the offensive in a war unlike any we have fought before. Today, we are safer, but we are not yet safe. On this solemn night, I've asked for some of your time to discuss the nature of the threat still before us, what we are doing to protect our nation, and the building of a more hopeful Middle East that holds the key to peacefor America and the world. On 9/11, our nation saw the face of evil. Yet on that awful day, we also witnessed something distinctly American: ordinary citizens rising to the occasion, and responding with extraordinary acts of courage. We saw courage in office workers who were trapped on the high floors of burning skyscrapers -- and called home so that their last words to their families would be of comfort and love. We saw courage in passengers aboard Flight 93, who recited the 23rd Psalm -- and then charged the cockpit. And we saw courage in the Pentagon staff who made it out of the flames and smoke -- and ran back in to answer cries for help. On this day, we remember the innocent who lost their lives -- and we pay tribute to those who gave their lives so thatothers might live. For many of our citizens, the wounds of that morning are still fresh. I've met firefighters and police officers who choke up at the memory of fallen comrades. I've stood with families gathered on a grassy field in Pennsylvania, who take bittersweet pride in loved ones who refused to be victims -- and gave America our first victory in the war on terror. I've sat beside young mothers with children who are now five years old -- and still long for the daddies who will never cradle them in their arms. Out of this suffering, we resolve to honor every man andwoman lost. And we seek their lasting memorial in a safer and more hopeful world. Since the horror of 9/11, we've learned a great deal about the enemy. We have learned that they are evil and kill without mercy -- but not without purpose. We have learned that they form a global network of extremists who are driven by a perverted vision of Islam -- a totalitarian ideology that hates freedom, rejects tolerance, and despises all dissent. And we have learned that their goal is to build a radical Islamic empire where women are prisoners in their homes, men are beaten for missing prayer meetings, and terrorists have a safe haven to plan and launch attacks on America and other civilized nations. The war against this enemy is more than a military conflict. It is the decisive ideological struggle of the 21st century, and thecalling of our generation. Our nation is being tested in a way that we have not been since the start of the Cold War. We saw what a handful of our enemies can do with box-cutters and plane tickets. We hear their threats to launch even more terrible attacks on our people. And we know that if they were able to get their hands on weapons of mass destruction, they would use them against us. We face an enemy determined to bring death and suffering into our homes. America did not ask for this war, and every American wishes it were over. So do I. But the war is not over -- and it will not be over until either we or the extremists emerge victorious. If we do not defeat these enemies now, we will leave our children to face a Middle East overrun by terrorist states and radical dictators armed with nuclear weapons. We are in a war that will set the course for thisnew century -- and determine the destiny of millions across the world. For America, 9/11 was more than a tragedy -- it changed the way we look at the world. On September the 11th, we resolved that we would go on the offense against our enemies, and we would not distinguish between the terrorists and those who harbor or support them. So we helped drive the Taliban from power in Afghanistan. We put al Qaeda on the run, and killed or captured most of those who planned the 9/11 attacks, including the man believed to be the mastermind, Khalid Sheik Mohammed. He and other suspected terrorists have been questioned by the Central Intelligence Agency, and they provided valuable information that has helped stop attacks in America and across the world. Now these men have been transferred to Guantanamo Bay, so they can be held to account for their actions. Osama bin Laden and other terrorists are still in hiding. Our message to them is clear: No matter how long it takes, America will find you, and we willbring you to justice. On September the 11th, we learned that America must confront threats before they reach our shores, whether those threats come from terrorist networks or terrorist states. I'm often asked why we're in Iraq when Saddam Hussein was not responsible for the 9/11 attacks. The answer is that the regime of Saddam Hussein was a clear threat. My administration, the Congress, and the United Nations saw the threat -- and after 9/11, Saddam's regime posed a risk that the world could not afford to take. The world is safer because Saddam Hussein is no longer in power. And now the challenge is to help the Iraqi people build a democracy that fulfills the dreams of the nearly 12 million Iraqis who came out to vote in free elections lastDecember. Al Qaeda and other extremists from across the world have come to Iraq to stop the rise of a free society in the heart of the Middle East. They have joined the remnants of Saddam's regime and other armed groups to foment sectarian violence and drive us out. Our enemies in Iraq are tough and they are committed -- but so are Iraqi and coalition forces. We're adapting to stay ahead of the enemy, and we are carrying out a clear plan to ensure that a democraticIraq succeeds. We're training Iraqi troops so they can defend their nation. We're helping Iraq's unity government grow in strength and serve its people. We will not leave until this work is done. Whatever mistakes have been made in Iraq, the worst mistake would be to think that if we pulled out, the terrorists would leave us alone. They will not leave us alone. They will follow us. The safety of America depends on the outcome of the battle in the streets of Baghdad. Osama bin Laden calls this fight ""the Third World War"" -- and he says that victory for the terrorists in Iraq will mean America's ""defeat and disgrace forever."" If we yield Iraq to men like bin Laden, our enemies will be emboldened; they will gain a new safe haven; they will use Iraq's resources to fuel their extremist movement. We will not allow this to happen. Americawill stay in the fight. Iraq will be a free nation, and a strong ally in the war on terror. We can be confident that our coalition will succeed because the Iraqi people have been steadfast in the face of unspeakable violence. And we can be confident in victory because of the skill and resolve of America's Armed Forces. Every one of our troops is a volunteer, and since the attacks of September the 11th, more than 1.6 million Americans have stepped forward to put on our nation's uniform. In Iraq, Afghanistan, and other fronts in the war on terror, the men and women of our military are making great sacrifices to keep us safe. Some have suffered terrible injuries -- and nearly 3,000 have given their lives. America cherishes their memory. We pray for their families. And we will never back down from the work theyhave begun. We also honor those who toil day and night to keep our homeland safe, and we are giving them the tools they need to protect our people. We've created the Department of Homeland Security. We have torn down the wall that kept law enforcement and intelligence from sharing information. We've tightened security at our airports and seaports and borders, and we've created new programs to monitor enemy bank records and phone calls. Thanks to the hard work of our law enforcement and intelligence professionals, we have broken up terrorist cellsin our midst and saved American lives. Five years after 9/11, our enemies have not succeeded in launching another attack on our soil, but they've not been idle. Al Qaeda and those inspired by its hateful ideology have carried out terrorist attacks in more than two dozen nations. And just last month, they were foiled in a plot to blow up passenger planes headed for the United States. They remain determined to attack America and kill our citizens -- and we are determined to stop them. We'll continue to give the men and women who protect us every resource and legal authoritythey need to do their jobs. In the first days after the 9/11 attacks I promised to use every element of national power to fight the terrorists, wherever we find them. One of the strongest weapons in our arsenal is the power of freedom. The terrorists fear freedom as much as they do our firepower. They are thrown into panic at the sight of an old man pulling the election lever, girls enrolling in schools, or families worshiping God in their own traditions. They know that given a choice, people will choose freedom over their extremist ideology. So their answer is to deny people this choice by raging against the forces of freedom and moderation. This struggle has been called a clash of civilizations. In truth, it is a struggle for civilization. We are fighting to maintain the way of life enjoyed by free nations. And we're fighting for the possibility that good and decent people across theMiddle East can raise up societies based on freedom and tolerance and personal dignity. We are now in the early hours of this struggle between tyranny and freedom. Amid the violence, some question whether the people of the Middle East want their freedom, and whether the forces of moderation can prevail. For 60 years, these doubts guided our policies in the Middle East. And then, on a bright September morning, it became clear that the calm we saw in the Middle East was only a mirage. Years of pursuing stability to promote peace had left us with neither. So we changed our policies, and committed America's influence in the world to advancing freedom and democracy as the great alternatives to repression andradicalism. With our help, the people of the Middle East are now stepping forward to claim their freedom. From Kabul to Baghdad to Beirut, there are brave men and women risking their lives each day for the same freedoms that we enjoy. And they have one question for us: Do we have the confidence to do in the Middle East what our fathers and grandfathers accomplished in Europe and Asia? By standing with democratic leaders and reformers, by giving voice to the hopes of decent men and women, we're offering a path away from radicalism. And we are enlisting the most powerful force for peace and moderation in the Middle East: the desire of millions to befree. Across the broader Middle East, the extremists are fighting to prevent such a future. Yet America has confronted evil before, and we have defeated it -- sometimes at the cost of thousands of good men in a single battle. When Franklin Roosevelt vowed to defeat two enemies across two oceans, he could not have foreseen D-Day and Iwo Jima -- but he would not have been surprised at the outcome. When Harry Truman promised American support for free peoples resisting Soviet aggression, he could not have foreseen the rise of the Berlin Wall -- but he would not have been surprised to see it brought down. Throughout our history, America has seen liberty challenged, and every time, we have seen liberty triumph withsacrifice and determination. At the start of this young century, America looks to the day when the people of the Middle East leave the desert of despotism for the fertile gardens of liberty, and resume their rightful place in a world of peace and prosperity. We look to the day when the nations of that region recognize their greatest resource is not the oil in the ground, but the talent and creativity of their people. We look to the day when moms and dads throughout the Middle East see a future of hope and opportunity for their children. And when that good day comes, the clouds of war will part, the appeal of radicalism will decline, and we will leave our children with abetter and safer world. On this solemn anniversary, we rededicate ourselves to this cause. Our nation has endured trials, and we face a difficult road ahead. Winning this war will require the determined efforts of a unified country, and we must put aside our differences and work together to meet the test that history has given us. We will defeat our enemies. We will protect our people. And wewill lead the 21st century into a shining age of human liberty. Earlier this year, I traveled to the United States Military Academy. I was there to deliver the commencement address to the first class to arrive at West Point after the attacks of September the 11th. That day I met a proud mom named RoseEllen Dowdell. She was there to watch her son, Patrick, accept his commission in the finest Army the world has ever known. A few weeks earlier, RoseEllen had watched her other son, James, graduate from the Fire Academy in New York City. On both these days, her thoughts turned to someone who was not there to share the moment: her husband, Kevin Dowdell. Kevin was one of the 343 firefighters who rushed to the burning towers of the World Trade Center on September the 11th -- and never came home. His sons lost their father that day, but not the passion for service he instilled in them. Here is what RoseEllen says about her boys: ""As a mother, I cross my fingers and pray all the time for their safety -- but as worried as I am, I'm also proud, and Iknow their dad would be, too."" Our nation is blessed to have young Americans like these -- and we will need them. Dangerous enemies have declared their intention to destroy our way of life. They're not the first to try, and their fate will be the same as those who tried before. Nine-Eleven showed us why. The attacks were meant to bring us to our knees, and they did, but not in the way the terrorists intended. Americans united in prayer, came to the aid of neighbors in need, and resolved that our enemies would not have the last word. The spirit of our people is the source of America's strength. And we go forward with trust in that spirit, confidence in our purpose, and faith in aloving God who made us to be free. Thank you, and may God bless you.",bush
"President Bush: Good afternoon, and welcome to the White House. Earlier today I announced my intent to nominate Robert Gates to be the next Secretary of the Defense. And now I'm pleased to introduce him to the American people. I also am looking forward to payingtribute to the man he will succeed. America remains a nation at war. We face brutal enemies who despise our freedom and want to destroy our way of life. These enemies attacked our country on September the 11th, 2001; they fight us in Afghanistan and Iraq, and they remain determined to attack our country again. Against such enemies, there's only one way to protect the American people: We muststay on the offense and bring our enemies to justice before they hurt us again. In this time of war, the President relies on the Secretary of Defense to provide military advice and direct our nation's Armed Forces as they engage our enemies across the world. The Secretary of Defense must be a man of vision who can see threats still over the horizon, and prepare our nation to meet them. Bob Gates is the right man to meet both of these criticalchallenges. Bob is one of our nation's most accomplished public servants. He joined the CIA in 1966, and has nearly 27 years of national security experience, serving six Presidents of both political parties. He spent nearly nine years serving on the National Security Council staff. And at the CIA, he rose from an entry-level employee to become the Director of the Central Intelligence.And his experience has prepared him well for this new assignment. Bob understands the challenges we face in Afghanistan. As President Reagan's Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, he helped lead America's efforts to drive Soviet forces from Afghanistan. Success in these efforts weakened the Soviet regime and helped hastenfreedom's victory in the Cold War. Bob understands the challenges facing our nation in Iraq. He served as Deputy National Security Advisor to the first President Bush during Operation Desert Storm as American troops repelled Iraqi aggression and drove Saddam Hussein's forces from Kuwait. More recently, he served as a member of the Iraq Study Group, a distinguished independent panel of Republicans and Democrats led by former Secretary of State Jim Baker and former Congressman Lee Hamilton. As part of this commission, he has traveled to Iraq and met with the country's leaders and our military commanders on the ground. He'll provide the department with a fresh perspective and new ideas on how America can achieve our goals inIraq. Bob understands how to lead large, complex institutions and transform them to meet new challenges. As Director of Central Intelligence, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, he was responsible for leading all the foreign intelligence agencies of the United States. And he's brought that same leadership and abilities as his work as President of our nation's sixth largest university, Texas A&M. When the A&M board of regents interviewed him for the job, he described himself as an agent of change. As president, he delivered on that promise, initiating wide-ranging reforms to almost every aspect of campus life. He'll bring that sametransformational spirit to his work in the Department of Defense. Bob Gates is a patriot whose love for country was nurtured in the Kansas community where he was raised. He's worn our nation's uniform. He's a strategic thinker who was educated at three of America's finest universities, receiving his bachelor's degree from William & Mary, a master's degree in history from Indiana University, and a doctorate in Russian and Soviethistory from Georgetown. He's a leader in the business community who served on the boards of several major corporations. He's a man of integrity, candor and sound judgment. He knows that the challenge of protecting our country is larger than any political party, and he has a record of working with leaders of both sides of the aisle to strengthen our national security. He has myconfidence and my trust, and he will be an outstanding Secretary of Defense. Bob follows in the footsteps of one of America's most skilled and capable national security leaders, Donald Rumsfeld. Don is the longest-serving member of my Cabinet, and next month he will reach another milestone when he becomes the longest-serving Secretary of Defense in the history of our nation. I appreciate his willingness to continue serving until his successor is in place, because in a time of war, our nation cannot be without a strong and steady handleading our Department of Defense. Don has served in times of great consequence for our nation. Few will forget the image of Don Rumsfeld as he helped rescue workers carry the victims from the rubble of the Pentagon on September the 11th, 2001. In the weeks that followed, he directed the effort to plan our nation's military response to an unprecedented attack on our soil. Under his leadership, U.S. and coalition forces launched one of the most innovative military campaigns in the history ofmodern warfare, driving the Taliban and its al Qaeda allies from power in a matter of weeks. In 2003, on my orders, he led the planning and execution of another historic military campaign, Operation Iraqi Freedom, that drove Saddam Hussein from power and helped the Iraqi people establish a constitutional democracy in the heart of the Middle East. History will record that on Don Rumsfeld's watch, the men and women of our military overthrew two terrorist regimes, liberated some 50 million people, brought justice to the terrorist Zarqawiand scores of senior al Qaeda operatives, and helped stop new terrorist attacks on our people. America is safer and the world is more secure because of the service and the leadership of Donald Rumsfeld. As he led the Pentagon in an unprecedented war, Don never took his eye off another vital responsibility, preparing America for the threats that await us as this new century unfolds. He developed a new defense strategy. He established a new Northern Command to protect the homeland, a new Joint Forces Command to focus on transformation, a new Strategic Command to defend against long-range attack, and transformed the U.S.Special Operations Command for the war on terror. He led our efforts to create a new NATO Response Force that allows NATO to deploy rapidly anywhere in the world. He undertook the most sweeping transformation of America's global force posture since the end of World War II. He revitalized America's efforts to develop and deploy ballistic missile defenses, and led a comprehensive review of America's nuclear forcesthat has allowed us to undertake dramatic reductions in offensive nuclear weapons. Don's work in these areas did not often make the headlines. But the reforms that he has set in motion are historic, and they will enhance the security of the American people for decades tocome. Over the past six years, I've relied on Don Rumsfeld's advice and counsel. I've come to know his character and his integrity. As the Secretary of Defense, he has been dedicated to his mission, loyal to his President, and devoted to the courageous men and women of our ArmedForces. Don once famously said, ""There are known knowns; there are known unknowns; and there are unknown unknowns."" Well, Mr. Secretary, here is a known known: Your service has made America stronger, and made America a safer nation. You will be missed, and I wish you andJoyce all the best in the years to come. Don Rumsfeld is a tough act to follow. That's why I picked a man of Bob Gates's caliber to succeed him. When confirmed by the Senate, Bob will bring talent, energy and innovation to the Department of Defense. He'll work every day to keep the American people safe and to make our nation more secure. And he'll do a superb job as America's next Secretary ofDefense. Bob, I appreciate you agreeing to serve our nation again, and congratulations. Robert Gates: Thank you, sir. Mr. President, thank you for this high honor and for your confidence. And let me add my thanks to Secretary Rumsfeld for his service. I entered public service 40 years ago last August. President Bush will be the seventh President I have served. I had not anticipated returning to government service, and have never enjoyed any position more than being president of Texas A&M University. However, the United States is at war, in Iraq and Afghanistan. We're fighting against terrorism worldwide. And we face other serious challenges to peace and our security. I believe the outcome of these conflicts will shape our world for decades to come. Because our long-term strategic interests and our national and homeland security are at risk, because so many of America's sons and daughters in our Armed Forces are in harm's way, I did not hesitate when thePresident asked me to return to duty. If confirmed by the Senate, I will serve with all my heart, and with gratitude to the Presidentfor giving me the opportunity to do so. Secretary Rumsfeld: Bob Gates, my congratulations to you on this nomination. My very bestwishes. Look forward to working with you in the transition. Mr. President, thank you for your kind words, and the wholly unexpected opportunity you provided me to serve in the Department of Defense again these past years -- six years. It's been quite a time. It recalls to mind the statement by Winston Churchill, something to the effect that ""I have benefited greatly from criticism, and at no time have I suffered a lackthereof."" The great respect that I have for your leadership, Mr. President, in this little understood, unfamiliar war, the first war of the 21st century -- it is not well-known, it was not well- understood, it is complex for people to comprehend. And I know, with certainty, that overtime the contributions you've made will be recorded by history. I must say that it's been the highest honor of my life to serve with the talented men and women of the Department of Defense, the amazing men and women -- young men and women in uniform. It's a privilege. And their patriotism, their professionalism, their dedicationis truly an inspiration. They have my respect; they will remain in my prayers always. Thank you.",bush
"Thank you very much. And tonight, I have a high privilege and distinct honor of my own -- as the first President to begin the State of the Union message with these words: MadamSpeaker. In his day, the late Congressman Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr. from Baltimore, Maryland, saw Presidents Roosevelt and Truman at this rostrum. But nothing could compare with the sight of his only daughter, Nancy, presiding tonight as Speaker of the House of Representatives.Congratulations, Madam Speaker. Two members of the House and Senate are not with us tonight, and we pray for the recoveryand speedy return of Senator Tim Johnson and Congressman Charlie Norwood. Madam Speaker, Vice President Cheney, members of Congress, distinguished guests, andfellow citizens: The rite of custom brings us together at a defining hour -- when decisions are hard and courage is needed. We enter the year 2007 with large endeavors underway, and others that are ours to begin. In all of this, much is asked of us. We must have the will to face difficultchallenges and determined enemies -- and the wisdom to face them together. Some in this chamber are new to the House and the Senate -- and I congratulate the Democrat majority. Congress has changed, but not our responsibilities. Each of us is guided by our own convictions -- and to these we must stay faithful. Yet we're all held to the same standards, and called to serve the same good purposes: To extend this nation's prosperity; to spend the people's money wisely; to solve problems, not leave them to future generations; toguard America against all evil; and to keep faith with those we have sent forth to defend us. We're not the first to come here with a government divided and uncertainty in the air. Like many before us, we can work through our differences, and achieve big things for the American people. Our citizens don't much care which side of the aisle we sit on -- as long as we're willing to cross that aisle when there is work to be done. Our job is to make life better for our fellow Americans, and to help them to build a future of hope and opportunity -- and this is thebusiness before us tonight. A future of hope and opportunity begins with a growing economy -- and that is what we have. We're now in the 41st month of uninterrupted job growth, in a recovery that has created 7.2 million new jobs -- so far. Unemployment is low, inflation is low, and wages are rising. This economy is on the move, and our job is to keep it that way, not with more government, butwith more enterprise. Next week, I'll deliver a full report on the state of our economy. Tonight, I want to discussthree economic reforms that deserve to be priorities for this Congress. First, we must balance the federal budget. We can do so without raising taxes. What we need to do is impose spending discipline in Washington, D.C. We set a goal of cutting the deficit in half by 2009, and met that goal three years ahead of schedule. Now let us take the next step. In the coming weeks, I will submit a budget that eliminates the federal deficit within the next five years. I ask you to make the same commitment. Together, we can restrain the spendingappetite of the federal government, and we can balance the federal budget. Next, there is the matter of earmarks. These special interest items are often slipped into bills at the last hour -- when not even C-SPAN is watching. In 2005 alone, the number of earmarks grew to over 13,000 and totaled nearly $18 billion. Even worse, over 90 percent of earmarks never make it to the floor of the House and Senate -- they are dropped into committee reports that are not even part of the bill that arrives on my desk. You didn't vote them into law. I didn't sign them into law. Yet, they're treated as if they have the force of law. The time has come to end this practice. So let us work together to reform the budget process, expose every earmark to the light of day and to a vote in Congress, and cut the number and cost ofearmarks at least in half by the end of this session. And, finally, to keep this economy strong we must take on the challenge of entitlements. Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid are commitments of conscience, and so it is our duty to keep them permanently sound. Yet, we're failing in that duty. And this failure will one day leave our children with three bad options: huge tax increases, huge deficits, or huge and immediate cuts in benefits. Everyone in this chamber knows this to be true -- yet somehow we have not found it in ourselves to act. So let us work together and do it now. With enoughgood sense and goodwill, you and I can fix Medicare and Medicaid -- and save Social Security. Spreading opportunity and hope in America also requires public schools that give children the knowledge and character they need in life. Five years ago, we rose above partisan differences to pass the No Child Left Behind Act, preserving local control, raising standards, and holding those schools accountable for results. And because we acted, students are performing betterin reading and math, and minority students are closing the achievement gap. Now the task is to build on the success, without watering down standards, without taking control from local communities, and without backsliding and calling it reform. We can lift student achievement even higher by giving local leaders flexibility to turn around failing schools, and by giving families with children stuck in failing schools the right to choose someplace better. We must increase funds for students who struggle -- and make sure these children get the special help they need. And we can make sure our children are prepared for the jobs of the future and our country is more competitive by strengthening math and science skills. The No Child Left Behind Act has worked for America's children -- and I ask Congress to reauthorizethis good law. A future of hope and opportunity requires that all our citizens have affordable and available health care. When it comes to health care, government has an obligation to care for the elderly, the disabled, and poor children. And we will meet those responsibilities. For all other Americans, private health insurance is the best way to meet their needs. But many Americanscannot afford a health insurance policy. And so tonight, I propose two new initiatives to help more Americans afford their own insurance. First, I propose a standard tax deduction for health insurance that will be like the standard tax deduction for dependents. Families with health insurance will pay no income on payroll tax -- or payroll taxes on $15,000 of their income. Single Americans with health insurance will pay no income or payroll taxes on $7,500 of their income. With this reform, more than 100 million men, women, and children who are now covered by employer-provided insurance will benefit from lower tax bills. At the same time, this reform will level the playing field for those who do not get health insurance through their job. For Americans who now purchase health insurance on their own, this proposal would mean a substantial tax savings -- $4,500 for a family of four making $60,000 a year. And for the millions of other Americans who have no health insurance at all, this deduction would help put a basic private health insurance plan within their reach. Changing the tax code is a vital and necessary step tomaking health care affordable for more Americans. My second proposal is to help the states that are coming up with innovative ways to cover the uninsured. States that make basic private health insurance available to all their citizens should receive federal funds to help them provide this coverage to the poor and the sick. I have asked the Secretary of Health and Human Services to work with Congress to take existing federal funds and use them to create ""Affordable Choices"" grants. These grants would give our nation's governors more money and more flexibility to get private health insurance to thosemost in need. There are many other ways that Congress can help. We need to expand Health Savings Accounts. We need to help small businesses through Association Health Plans. We need to reduce costs and medical errors with better information technology. We will encourage price transparency. And to protect good doctors from junk lawsuits, we passing medical liability reform. In all we do, we must remember that the best health care decisions are made not bygovernment and insurance companies, but by patients and their doctors. Extending hope and opportunity in our country requires an immigration system worthy of America -- with laws that are fair and borders that are secure. When laws and borders are routinely violated, this harms the interests of our country. To secure our border, we'redoubling the size of the Border Patrol, and funding new infrastructure and technology. Yet even with all these steps, we cannot fully secure the border unless we take pressure off the border -- and that requires a temporary worker program. We should establish a legal and orderly path for foreign workers to enter our country to work on a temporary basis. As a result, they won't have to try to sneak in, and that will leave Border Agents free to chase down drug smugglers and criminals and terrorists. We'll enforce our immigration laws at the work site and give employers the tools to verify the legal status of their workers, so there's noexcuse left for violating the law. We need to uphold the great tradition of the melting pot that welcomes and assimilates new arrivals. We need to resolve the status of the illegal immigrants who are already in our country without animosity and without amnesty. Convictions run deep in this Capitol when it comes to immigration. Let us have a serious, civil, and conclusive debate, so that you canpass, and I can sign, comprehensive immigration reform into law. Extending hope and opportunity depends on a stable supply of energy that keeps America's economy running and America's environment clean. For too long our nation has been dependent on foreign oil. And this dependence leaves us more vulnerable to hostile regimes, and to terrorists -- who could cause huge disruptions of oil shipments, and raise the price ofoil, and do great harm to our economy. It's in our vital interest to diversify America's energy supply -- the way forward is through technology. We must continue changing the way America generates electric power, by even greater use of clean coal technology, solar and wind energy, and clean, safe nuclear power. We need to press on with battery research for plug-in and hybrid vehicles, and expand the use of clean diesel vehicles and biodiesel fuel. We must continue investing in new methods ofproducing ethanol -- using everything from wood chips to grasses, to agricultural wastes. We made a lot of progress, thanks to good policies here in Washington and the strong response of the market. And now even more dramatic advances are within reach. Tonight, I ask Congress to join me in pursuing a great goal. Let us build on the work we've done and reduce gasoline usage in the United States by 20 percent in the next 10 years. When we do that we will have cut our total imports by the equivalent of three-quarters of all the oil we nowimport from the Middle East. To reach this goal, we must increase the supply of alternative fuels, by setting a mandatory fuels standard to require 35 billion gallons of renewable and alternative fuels in 2017 -- and that is nearly five times the current target. At the same time, we need to reform and modernize fuel economy standards for cars the way we did for light trucks -- and conserve upto 8.5 billion more gallons of gasoline by 2017. Achieving these ambitious goals will dramatically reduce our dependence on foreign oil, but it's not going to eliminate it. And so as we continue to diversify our fuel supply, we must step up domestic oil production in environmentally sensitive ways. And to further protect America against severe disruptions to our oil supply, I ask Congress to double the current capacity ofthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve. America is on the verge of technological breakthroughs that will enable us to live our lives less dependent on oil. And these technologies will help us be better stewards of the environment,and they will help us to confront the serious challenge of global climate change. A future of hope and opportunity requires a fair, impartial system of justice. The lives of our citizens across our nation are affected by the outcome of cases pending in our federal courts. We have a shared obligation to ensure that the federal courts have enough judges to hear those cases and deliver timely rulings. As President, I have a duty to nominate qualified men and women to vacancies on the federal bench. And the United States Senate has a duty, as well, to give those nominees a fair hearing, and a prompt up-or-down vote on the Senatefloor. For all of us in this room, there is no higher responsibility than to protect the people of this country from danger. Five years have come and gone since we saw the scenes and felt the sorrow that the terrorists can cause. We've had time to take stock of our situation. We've added many critical protections to guard the homeland. We know with certainty that the horrors of that September morning were just a glimpse of what the terrorists intend for us --unless we stop them. With the distance of time, we find ourselves debating the causes of conflict and the course we have followed. Such debates are essential when a great democracy faces great questions. Yet one question has surely been settled: that to win the war on terror we must take the fight tothe enemy. From the start, America and our allies have protected our people by staying on the offense. The enemy knows that the days of comfortable sanctuary, easy movement, steady financing, and free flowing communications are long over. For the terrorists, life since 9/11 has neverbeen the same. Our success in this war is often measured by the things that did not happen. We cannot know the full extent of the attacks that we and our allies have prevented, but here is some of what we do know: We stopped an al Qaeda plot to fly a hijacked airplane into the tallest building on the West Coast. We broke up a Southeast Asian terror cell grooming operatives for attacks inside the United States. We uncovered an al Qaeda cell developing anthrax to be used in attacks against America. And just last August, British authorities uncovered a plot to blow up passenger planes bound for America over the Atlantic Ocean. For each life saved, we owe a debt of gratitude to the brave public servants who devote their lives to finding the terroristsand stopping them. Every success against the terrorists is a reminder of the shoreless ambitions of this enemy. The evil that inspired and rejoiced in 9/11 is still at work in the world. And so long as that'sthe case, America is still a nation at war. In the mind of the terrorist, this war began well before September the 11th, and will not end until their radical vision is fulfilled. And these past five years have given us a much clearer view of the nature of this enemy. Al Qaeda and its followers are Sunni extremists, possessed by hatred and commanded by a harsh and narrow ideology. Take almost any principle of civilization, and their goal is the opposite. They preach withthreats, instruct with bullets and bombs, and promise paradise for the murder of the innocent. Our enemies are quite explicit about their intentions. They want to overthrow moderate governments, and establish safe havens from which to plan and carry out new attacks on our country. By killing and terrorizing Americans, they want to force our country to retreat from the world and abandon the cause of liberty. They would then be free to impose their will and spread their totalitarian ideology. Listen to this warning from the late terrorist Zarqawi: ""We will sacrifice our blood and bodies to put an end to your dreams, and what is coming is even worse."" Osama bin Laden declared: ""Death is better than living on this Earth with theunbelievers among us."" These men are not given to idle words, and they are just one camp in the Islamist radical movement. In recent times, it has also become clear that we face an escalating danger from Shia extremists who are just as hostile to America, and are also determined to dominate the Middle East. Many are known to take direction from the regime in Iran, which is funding and arming terrorists like Hezbollah -- a group second only to al Qaeda in the American lives it hastaken. The Shia and Sunni extremists are different faces of the same totalitarian threat. Whatever slogans they chant, when they slaughter the innocent they have the same wicked purposes. They want to kill Americans, kill democracy in the Middle East, and gain the weapons to kill onan even more horrific scale. In the sixth year since our nation was attacked, I wish I could report to you that the dangers had ended. They have not. And so it remains the policy of this government to use every lawful and proper tool of intelligence, diplomacy, law enforcement, and military action to do ourduty, to find these enemies, and to protect the American people. This war is more than a clash of arms -- it is a decisive ideological struggle, and the security of our nation is in the balance. To prevail, we must remove the conditions that inspire blind hatred, and drove 19 men to get onto airplanes and to come and kill us. What every terrorist fears most is human freedom -- societies where men and women make their own choices, answer to their own conscience, and live by their hopes instead of their resentments. Free people are not drawn to violent and malignant ideologies -- and most will choose a better way when they're given a chance. So we advance our own security interests by helping moderates and reformers and brave voices for democracy. The great question of our day is whether America will help men and women in the Middle East to build free societies and sharein the rights of all humanity. And I say, for the sake of our own security, we must. In the last two years, we've seen the desire for liberty in the broader Middle East -- and we have been sobered by the enemy's fierce reaction. In 2005, the world watched as the citizens of Lebanon raised the banner of the Cedar Revolution, they drove out the Syrian occupiers and chose new leaders in free elections. In 2005, the people of Afghanistan defied the terrorists and elected a democratic legislature. And in 2005, the Iraqi people held three national elections, choosing a transitional government, adopting the most progressive, democratic constitution in the Arab world, and then electing a government under that constitution. Despite endless threats from the killers in their midst, nearly 12 million Iraqicitizens came out to vote in a show of hope and solidarity that we should never forget. A thinking enemy watched all of these scenes, adjusted their tactics, and in 2006 they struck back. In Lebanon, assassins took the life of Pierre Gemayel, a prominent participant in the Cedar Revolution. Hezbollah terrorists, with support from Syria and Iran, sowed conflict in the region and are seeking to undermine Lebanon's legitimately elected government. In Afghanistan, Taliban and al Qaeda fighters tried to regain power by regrouping and engaging Afghan and NATO forces. In Iraq, al Qaeda and other Sunni extremists blew up one of the most sacred places in Shia Islam -- the Golden Mosque of Samarra. This atrocity, directed at a Muslim house of prayer, was designed to provoke retaliation from Iraqi Shia -- and it succeeded. Radical Shia elements, some of whom receive support from Iran, formed death squads. The result was a tragic escalation of sectarian rage and reprisal that continues to thisday. This is not the fight we entered in Iraq, but it is the fight we're in. Every one of us wishes this war were over and won. Yet it would not be like us to leave our promises unkept, our friends abandoned, and our own security at risk. Ladies and gentlemen: On this day, at this hour, it is still within our power to shape the outcome of this battle. Let us find our resolve, and turnevents toward victory. We're carrying out a new strategy in Iraq -- a plan that demands more from Iraq's elected government, and gives our forces in Iraq the reinforcements they need to complete their mission. Our goal is a democratic Iraq that upholds the rule of law, respects the rights of itspeople, provides them security, and is an ally in the war on terror. In order to make progress toward this goal, the Iraqi government must stop the sectarian violence in its capital. But the Iraqis are not yet ready to do this on their own. So we're deploying reinforcements of more than 20,000 additional soldiers and Marines to Iraq. The vast majority will go to Baghdad, where they will help Iraqi forces to clear and secure neighborhoods, and serve as advisers embedded in Iraqi Army units. With Iraqis in the lead, our forces will help secure the city by chasing down the terrorists, insurgents, and the roaming death squads. And in Anbar Province, where al Qaeda terrorists have gathered and local forces have begun showing a willingness to fight them, we're sending an additional 4,000 United States Marines, with orders to find the terrorists and clear them out. We didn't drive al Qaeda out of their safe haven in Afghanistan only to let them set up a new safe haven in afree Iraq. The people of Iraq want to live in peace, and now it's time for their government to act. Iraq's leaders know that our commitment is not open-ended. They have promised to deploy more of their own troops to secure Baghdad -- and they must do so. They pledged that they will confront violent radicals of any faction or political party -- and they need to follow through, and lift needless restrictions on Iraqi and coalition forces, so these troops can achieve their mission of bringing security to all of the people of Baghdad. Iraq's leaders have committed themselves to a series of benchmarks -- to achieve reconciliation, to share oil revenues among all of Iraq's citizens, to put the wealth of Iraq into the rebuilding of Iraq, to allow more Iraqis to re-enter their nation's civic life, to hold local elections, and to take responsibility for security in every Iraqi province. But for all of this to happen, Baghdad must be secure. And our plan will help the Iraqi government take back its capital and make good on itscommitments. My fellow citizens, our military commanders and I have carefully weighed the options. We discussed every possible approach. In the end, I chose this course of action because it provides the best chance for success. Many in this chamber understand that America must not fail in Iraq, because you understand that the consequences of failure would be grievous andfar-reaching. If American forces step back before Baghdad is secure, the Iraqi government would be overrun by extremists on all sides. We could expect an epic battle between Shia extremists backed by Iran, and Sunni extremists aided by al Qaeda and supporters of the old regime. A contagion of violence could spill out across the country -- and in time, the entire region couldbe drawn into the conflict. For America, this is a nightmare scenario. For the enemy, this is the objective. Chaos is the greatest ally -- their greatest ally in this struggle. And out of chaos in Iraq would emerge an emboldened enemy with new safe havens, new recruits, new resources, and an even greater determination to harm America. To allow this to happen would be to ignore the lessons of September the 11th and invite tragedy. Ladies and gentlemen, nothing is more important at this moment in our history than for America to succeed in the Middle East, to succeed in Iraqand to spare the American people from this danger. This is where matters stand tonight, in the here and now. I have spoken with many of you in person. I respect you and the arguments you've made. We went into this largely united, in our assumptions and in our convictions. And whatever you voted for, you did not vote for failure. Our country is pursuing a new strategy in Iraq, and I ask you to give it a chance to work. AndI ask you to support our troops in the field, and those on their way. The war on terror we fight today is a generational struggle that will continue long after you and I have turned our duties over to others. And that's why it's important to work together so our nation can see this great effort through. Both parties and both branches should work in close consultation. It's why I propose to establish a special advisory council on the war on terror, made up of leaders in Congress from both political parties. We will share ideas for how to position America to meet every challenge that confronts us. We'll show our enemies abroadthat we are united in the goal of victory. And one of the first steps we can take together is to add to the ranks of our military so that the American Armed Forces are ready for all the challenges ahead. Tonight I ask the Congress to authorize an increase in the size of our active Army and Marine Corps by 92,000 in the next five years. A second task we can take on together is to design and establish a volunteer Civilian Reserve Corps. Such a corps would function much like our military reserve. It would ease the burden on the Armed Forces by allowing us to hire civilians with critical skills to serve on missions abroad when America needs them. It would give people across Americawho do not wear the uniform a chance to serve in the defining struggle of our time. Americans can have confidence in the outcome of this struggle because we're not in this struggle alone. We have a diplomatic strategy that is rallying the world to join in the fight against extremism. In Iraq, multinational forces are operating under a mandate from the United Nations. We're working with Jordan and Saudi Arabia and Egypt and the Gulf States toincrease support for Iraq's government. The United Nations has imposed sanctions on Iran, and made it clear that the world will not allow the regime in Tehran to acquire nuclear weapons. With the other members of the Quartet -- the U.N., the European Union, and Russia -- we're pursuing diplomacy to help bring peace to the Holy Land, and pursuing the establishment of a democratic Palestinian state living side-by-side with Israel in peace and security. In Afghanistan, NATO has taken the lead in turning back the Taliban and al Qaeda offensive -- the first time the Alliance has deployed forces outside the North Atlantic area. Together with our partners in China, Japan, Russia, and South Korea, we're pursuing intensive diplomacy to achieve a Korean Peninsula free of nuclearweapons. We will continue to speak out for the cause of freedom in places like Cuba, Belarus, andBurma -- and continue to awaken the conscience of the world to save the people of Darfur. American foreign policy is more than a matter of war and diplomacy. Our work in the world is also based on a timeless truth: To whom much is given, much is required. We hear the call to take on the challenges of hunger and poverty and disease -- and that is precisely what America is doing. We must continue to fight HIV/AIDS, especially on the continent of Africa. Because you funded our Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the number of people receiving life- saving drugs has grown from 50,000 to more than 800,000 in three short years. I ask you to continue funding our efforts to fight HIV/AIDS. I ask you to provide $1.2 billion over five yearsso we can combat malaria in 15 African countries. I ask that you fund the Millennium Challenge Account, so that American aid reaches the people who need it, in nations where democracy is on the rise and corruption is in retreat. And let us continue to support the expanded trade and debt relief that are the best hope forlifting lives and eliminating poverty. When America serves others in this way, we show the strength and generosity of our country. These deeds reflect the character of our people. The greatest strength we have is the heroic kindness, courage, and self-sacrifice of the American people. You see this spirit often if youknow where to look -- and tonight we need only look above to the gallery. Dikembe Mutombo grew up in Africa, amid great poverty and disease. He came to Georgetown University on a scholarship to study medicine -- but Coach John Thompson got a look at Dikembe and had a different idea. Dikembe became a star in the NBA, and a citizen of the United States. But he never forgot the land of his birth, or the duty to share his blessings with others. He built a brand new hospital in his old hometown. A friend has said of this good- hearted man: ""Mutombo believes that God has given him this opportunity to do great things.""And we are proud to call this son of the Congo a citizen of the United States of America. After her daughter was born, Julie Aigner-Clark searched for ways to share her love of music and art with her child. So she borrowed some equipment, and began filming children's videos in her basement. The Baby Einstein Company was born, and in just five years her business grew to more than $20 million in sales. In November 2001, Julie sold Baby Einstein to the Walt Disney Company, and with her help Baby Einstein has grown into a $200 million business. Julie represents the great enterprising spirit of America. And she is using her success to help others -- producing child safety videos with John Walsh of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Julie says of her new project: ""I believe it's the most important thing that I have ever done. I believe that children have the right to live in a world that is safe."" And so tonight, we are pleased to welcome this talented business entrepreneurand generous social entrepreneur -- Julie Aigner-Clark. Three weeks ago, Wesley Autrey was waiting at a Harlem subway station with his two little girls, when he saw a man fall into the path of a train. With seconds to act, Wesley jumped onto the tracks, pulled the man into the space between the rails, and held him as the train passed right above their heads. He insists he's not a hero. He says: ""We got guys and girls overseas dying for us to have our freedoms. We have got to show each other some love."" There is something wonderful about a country that produces a brave and humble man likeWesley Autrey. Tommy Rieman was a teenager pumping gas in Independence, Kentucky, when he enlisted in the United States Army. In December 2003, he was on a reconnaissance mission in Iraq when his team came under heavy enemy fire. From his Humvee, Sergeant Rieman returned fire; he used his body as a shield to protect his gunner. He was shot in the chest and arm, and received shrapnel wounds to his legs -- yet he refused medical attention, and stayed in the fight. He helped to repel a second attack, firing grenades at the enemy's position. For his exceptional courage, Sergeant Rieman was awarded the Silver Star. And like so many other Americans who have volunteered to defend us, he has earned the respect and the gratitude ofour entire country. In such courage and compassion, ladies and gentlemen, we see the spirit and character of America -- and these qualities are not in short supply. This is a decent and honorable country -- and resilient, too. We've been through a lot together. We've met challenges and faced dangers, and we know that more lie ahead. Yet we can go forward with confidence -- because the State of our Union is strong, our cause in the world is right, and tonight that cause goeson. God bless. See you next year. Thank you for your prayers.",bush
"Governor, thank you. President Steger, thank you very much. Students, and faculty, and staff,and grieving family members, and members of this really extraordinary place. Laura and I have come to Blacksburg today with hearts full of sorrow. This is a day of mourning for the Virginia Tech community -- and it is a day of sadness for our entire nation. We've come to express our sympathy. In this time of anguish, I hope you know that people all over this country are thinking about you, and asking God to provide comfort for all who havebeen affected. Yesterday began like any other day. Students woke up, and they grabbed their backpacks and they headed for class. And soon the day took a dark turn, with students and faculty barricading themselves in classrooms and dormitories -- confused, terrified, and deeply worried. By the end of the morning, it was the worst day of violence on a college campus inAmerican history -- and for many of you here today, it was the worst day of your lives. It's impossible to make sense of such violence and suffering. Those whose lives were taken did nothing to deserve their fate. They were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. Now they're gone -- and they leave behind grieving families, and grieving classmates, and agrieving nation. In such times as this, we look for sources of strength to sustain us. And in this moment of loss, you're finding these sources everywhere around you. These sources of strength are in this community, this college community. You have a compassionate and resilient community here at Virginia Tech. Even as yesterday's events were still unfolding, members of this community found each other; you came together in dorm rooms and dining halls and onblogs. One recent graduate wrote this: I don't know most of you guys, but we're all Hokies, which means we're family. To all of you who are okay, I'm happy for that. For those of you who are in pain or have lost someone close to you, I'm sure you can call on anyone of us and have help any timeyou need it. These sources of strength are with your loved ones. For many of you, your first instinct was to call home and let your moms and dads know that you were okay. Others took on the terrible duty of calling the relatives of a classmate or a colleague who had been wounded or lost. I know many of you feel awfully far away from people you lean on, people you count on during difficult times. But as a dad, I can assure you, a parent's love is never far from their child's heart. And as you draw closer to your own families in the coming days, I ask you to reach outto those who ache for sons and daughters who will never come home. These sources of strength are also in the faith that sustains so many of us. Across the town of Blacksburg and in towns all across America, houses of worship from every faith have opened their doors and have lifted you up in prayer. People who have never met you are praying for you; they're praying for your friends who have fallen and who are injured. There's a power in these prayers, real power. In times like this, we can find comfort in the grace and guidance of a loving God. As the Scriptures tells us, ""Don't be overcome by evil, but overcome evil withgood.""   And on this terrible day of mourning, it's hard to imagine that time will come when life at Virginia Tech will return to normal. But such a day will come. And when it does, you will always remember the friends and teachers who were lost yesterday, and the time you sharedwith them, and the lives they hoped to lead. May God bless you. May God bless and keep the souls of the lost. And may His love touch all those who suffer in grief.    Romans 12:21 (World English Bible)",bush
"United States of America, I welcome you in Ramallah, as well as in Bethlehem, on the land of Palestine, that welcomes you today as a great guest, that goes with him, commitment towards the peace process. It's a historic visit that gives our people great hope in the fact that your great nation is standing and supporting their dream and their yearning towards freedomand independence and living in peace in this area, alongside their neighbors. Our people will not forget Your Excellency, your invitation and your commitment towards the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. You are the first American President thatconfirms and reiterates this right. [Translation earpiece not working.] President Bush: I haven't got it yet. You may have to start over. Not yet. You better stayawake. President Abbas: Our people, Your Excellency -- President Bush: I agree completely. President Abbas: Your commitment towards an establishment of an independent Palestinian state -- you are the first American President to reiterate this right. The conferences of Annapolis and Paris were an historic step from you and from the American people and theworld as a whole to perfect this commitment and push it forward. Our Palestinian people, who committed to peace as a strategic option, want to see, through your support and your intervention, and end to its suffering and the suffering of its people and their families, and wants to move freely in their homeland, and develop their life and their economy without any obstacles that hinder that progress, and without a separation wall that fragments the land, and without settlements that is governing its land and future. We want to see a different future where prisons are not crowded with thousands of prisoners, and where hospitals are not crowded with tens of innocent victims every day, without checkpoints andqueues of ordinary people who suffer from humiliation and siege. I would like to point out here that we instructed our government to continue the work towards enhancing security and imposing public order, and establishing good governance that is based on the rule of law, and to consolidate the role of our democratic institutions and strengthen the work of the civil society, as well as work on consolidating development and administrative and financial reform and transparency, so that we can lay the foundations for a modern anddemocratic state. And the government is taking intensive steps in that direction, and I would like to express our appreciation for the support of your administration in the economic sphere in order to develop the infrastructure and provide new job opportunities, and improve the level of services and allother projects that contribute in improving the lives and the conditions of living for our people. We and our Israeli neighbors, and under your direct sponsorship -- bilateral negotiations that address all issues of final status are core issues -- that we would like to end these negotiations during your term in office and that we -- it will be ending by the -- ending of the occupation that started in 1967, and that establishment of an independent Palestinian state, and its capital, Jerusalem, based on your vision and the international resolutions, and that we find a fair solution for the tragedy of refugees, according to the Arab initiative for peace andaccording to the U.N. resolutions. And on this occasion I would like to reiterate before you our commitment to all our obligations that we agreed to. And we call upon Israel, as well, to fulfill its commitments according to the road map plan, because we firmly believe that peace is made by a will and a sharedcommitment among all parties. Your historic visit today to the Palestinian Territories is highly appreciated by our people, and it's a new expression of your deep commitment towards establishing peace on the land of peace. We appreciate the complete seriousness that characterizes your visit and your efforts today to continue and build and capitalize on this important opportunity that is available to usand to the Israelis. We start with you a new year, hoping that this will be the year for the creation of peace. You will hear today in Bethlehem the call for prayers from the mosques, and the heralding of bells at the Church of Nativity, that confirms our common message, the message of human tolerance and real peace that is deeply rooted in our conscience and in our heritage. Your presence today amongst us, Your Excellency, is a reiteration for the call for comprehensive and just peace that you called for and you committed yourself to. And the echo of this call reaches all the people and the countries in our region, because the voice that is now going out of Palestine is the closest and the deepest in reaching the hearts of all the people in theregion. Please, Your Excellency, trust that peace in the world starts from here, from the Holy Land.We welcome you again, our dear guest and our dear friend, here in Palestine. President Bush: Mr. President, thank you for your hospitality. We have met a lot in the pastand I'm glad to finally have a chance to sit down in your office to discuss important issues. [Interruption in the translation audio.] Is it working? Listen, they say I have enough problemsspeaking English as it is. I have had numerous opportunities to visit with the President. And the fundamental question I have is whether or not he is committed to peace. It's the same question I had for the Prime Minister of Israel. And I've come to the conclusion that both men understand the importanceto democratic states living side by side in peace. President Abbas was elected on a platform of peace. In other words, he just wasn't somebody who starts talking about it lately, he campaigned on it. He also said that if you give me a chance, I'll work to improve the lives of the average Palestinians, and that's what he has done. It's certainly not easy work. The conditions on the ground are very difficult and, nevertheless, this man and his government not only works for a vision, but also works to improve the lives of the average citizens, which is essential for the emergence of a Palestiniandemocracy. I talked to him today about how -- what we can do to help and, as he mentioned, the United States has been an active financial giver, we helped at the Paris Conference. I firmly believe that the Palestinians are entrepreneurial people who, if just given a chance, will be able togrow their businesses and provide jobs. We talked about the need to fight off the extremists. The world in which we live is a dangerous world because there are people who murder innocent people to achieve political objectives, not just here in this immediate part of the world, but around the world. That's what we're dealing with in Iraq and Afghanistan and Lebanon. And the fundamental question is, will nations stand up and help those who understand the ideological struggle we're in. And the President understands the ideological struggle. He knows that a handful of people want todash the aspirations of the Palestinian people by creating chaos and violence. And I appreciate that, Mr. President. And I appreciate your understanding that, ultimately, theway to achieve peace is to offer an alternative vision, and that's a vision based upon liberty. Now, look, there are some in the world who don't believe in the universality of freedom. I understand that. They say, like, freedom is okay for some of us, but maybe not all of us. I understand it, but I reject it. I believe in the universality of freedom. I believe, deep in the soul of every man, woman, and child on the face of this Earth is the desire to live in a free society. And I also believe free societies yield peace. And, therefore, this notion of two states living side by side in peace is based upon the universality of freedom, and if given a chance,the Palestinian people will work for freedom. And that's a challenge ahead of us -- is, is it possible for the Israelis and the Palestinians to work out their differences on core issues so that a vision can emerge? And my answer is, absolutely, it's possible. Not only is it possible, it's necessary. And I'm looking forward tohelping. You know, there's a great anticipation that all the American President has got to do is step in, and just say, okay, this is the way it's going to be. That's not how the system works. In order for there to be lasting peace, President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert have to come together and make tough choices. And I'm convinced they will. And I believe it's possible -- not only possible, I believe it's going to happen, that there will be a signed peace treaty by the time I leave office. That's what I believe. And the reason I believe that is because I hear the urgency in the voice of both the Prime Minister of Israel and the President of thePalestinian Authority. Is it going to be hard work? You bet. And we can help support these negotiations, and will. I was asked yesterday at a press conference, you know, what do you intend to do; if you're not going to write the agreement, what do you intend to do? I said, nudge the process forward -- like, pressure; be a pain if I need to be a pain -- which in some people's mind isn't all that hard. And they said, well, like -- yesterday, somebody said, well, are you disappointed? I arrived and it nudged the process forward. In other words, we can help influence the process, and will. But the only lasting peace will be achieved when the duly elected leaders ofthe respective peoples do the hard work. And so I want to help. And I want to help in the region, as well, Mr. President. The rest of my trip will be talking about, obviously, security threats, but also the opportunity to achieve peace. And the Arab world has got an opportunity and obligation, in my judgment, to helpboth parties in these negotiations move the process forward. I explained yesterday, and I just want to explain again today, there are three tracks to this process, as far as we're concerned. One is the negotiations to define a vision that will besubject to the road map. Secondly is to resolve -- help resolve road map issues. And today I introduced the President to the General -- three-star Air Force General who will be running this process. We have agreed to a trilateral process and want to help the Israelis and the Palestinians resolve theirdifferences over road map issues. And thirdly is to help the Palestinians develop the infrastructure necessary for a democracy -- an economy -- and security forces that are capable of doing what the President and the Prime Minister want to have done. And we're very much engaged. I'm looking forward to seeing Tony Blair tomorrow, who is the Quartet's representative, and to find out what he has beendoing and what progress is being made. I am confident that with proper help, the state of Palestine will emerge. And I'm confident that when it emerges it will be a major step towards peace. I am confident that the status quo is unacceptable, Mr. President, and we want to help you. And I appreciate your vision, and I appreciate your courage, and I appreciate your hospitality. And I appreciate you giving me achance to talk to the press, of course. A couple of questions, I understand. Question: Mr. President Abu Mazen, what are the results of this visit? Mr. President Bush, you said more than once that the Palestinian side must fulfill its obligations. And Mr. Fayyad has had a security plan to help the peace. And when Mr. Fayyad went to Annapolis he commended that security plan, and then Israel destroyed all those efforts in Annapolis. How can the Palestinian Authority do security efforts that are successful, and while Israel destroysand undermines all their efforts in the occupied territories? The other side of the question: Are you willing to give guarantees for the Palestinian side todeclaring a freezing on settlements immediately? Thank you. President Abbas: [As translated.] We are fully satisfied with the outcome that we reached through this visit of Mr. President George Bush. We spoke about all topics that might occur to your mind and that might not occur to your mind, as well. All the issues are in agreement. Weare agreed on all topics. All topics are clear. In the near future, in the coming few days, we are going to meet in bilateral negotiations with the Israelis in order to discuss the final status negotiations, final status issues. And as Mr. President said, there are three themes -- the other theme is implementing the road map through the committee, the trilateral committee. And the third point is the economic and security conditions in Palestinian Territories. We have great hopes that during 2008 we willreach the final status and a peace treaty with Israel. President Bush: Each side has got obligations under the road map. Settlements are clearly stated in the road map obligations for Israel. We have made our concerns about expansion ofsettlements known, and we expect both parties to honor their obligations under the road map. Secondly, we're spending -- General Dayton is spending a lot of time trying to help the President and the Prime Minister develop security forces that are effective. There's no question in my mind the commitment to provide security for the average citizen is strong. The question is the capabilities. And the truth of the matter is there needs to be a fair amount of work done to make sure that the security forces are modernized, well-trained and prepared, with a proper chain ofcommand to respond. And I will tell you I firmly believe the security forces are improving. I remember our visit in New York, and we discussed this during the U.N. General Assembly. And by any objective measurement, the Palestinian security forces in the West Bank areimproving. And so my message to the Israelis is that they ought to help, not hinder, the modernization of the Palestinian security force. It's in their interests that a government dedicated to peace andunderstanding the need for two states to live side by side in peace have a modern force. It's got -- very important for the government to be able to assure people that if there is a need, there will be an effective force to provide security. That's just step one of having credibility with the people. And to the extent that Israeli actions have undermined the effectiveness of the Palestinian force, or the authority of the state relative to the averagecitizen, is something that we don't agree with and have made our position clear. She just called on you. Question: -- [inaudible] -- President Bush: No, that's the road map obligation I was talking about. Question: -- [inaudible] -- President Bush: Yes. He's asking me about the checkpoints I drove through and my impression about what it was like to drive through checkpoints. I can understand why the Palestinians are frustrated driving through checkpoints. I can also understand that until confidence is gained on both sides, why the Israelis would want there to be a sense of security. In other words, they don't want a state on their border from which attacks would be launched. I can understand that. Any reasonable person can understand that. Why would you work tohave a state on your border if you weren't confident they'd be a partner in peace? And so checkpoints create frustrations for people. They create a sense of security for Israel; they create massive frustrations for the Palestinians. You'll be happy to hear that my motorcade of a mere 45 cars was able to make it through without being stopped. But I'm not so exactly sure that's what happens to the average person. And so the whole object is to create a state that is capable of defending itself internally, and giving confidence to itsneighbor that checkpoints won't be needed. Now, the vision of the Palestinian state is one of contiguous territory. In other words, as I said earlier in my administration, I said, Swiss cheese isn't going to work when it comes to the outline of a state. And I mean that. There is no way that this good man can assure the Palestinians of a hopeful future if there's not contiguous territory. And we -- that position is abundantly clear to both sides. Therefore, the ultimate vision, of course, is there be nocheckpoints throughout the Palestinian state-to-be. And, you know, this is the issue. We're working through how to gain enough confidence on both sides so that checkpoints won't be necessary, and a state can emerge. My judgment is, I can understand frustrations. I mean, I hear it a lot. I heard it -- you know, the chief negotiator spent two hours at a checkpoint. All he was trying to do was go negotiate. And I can see that -- I can see the frustrations. Look, I also understand that people in Israel -- and the truth of the matter is, in the Palestinian Territories -- the average citizen wants to knowwhether or not there's going to be protection from the violent few who murder. The security of a state is essential, particularly in a day and age when people simply disregard the value of human life, and kill. And so these checkpoints reflect the reality. And what we're trying to do is alter the reality by laying out a vision that is much more hopeful than thestatus quo. Question: Mr. President George Bush -- you launched war against Iraq after the Iraqi leadership refused to implement the United Nations resolutions. My question now is, what is the problem to ask Israel just to accept and to respect the United Nations resolutions relating to the Palestinian problem, which -- facilitating the achievement of ending the Israeli occupation to the Arab territories and facilitating also the solution between Palestinians andthe Israelis? And for Mahmoud Abbas, did you ask President George Bush to ask Israel to freezesettlements fully in order to enable negotiations from success? President Bush: Yes, but tell me the part about the U.N. thing again? What were you -- Icouldn't understand you very well. Question: I just asked why you ask Israel to accept the United Nations resolutions related tothe Palestinian problem, just to facilitate the solution, and to end the occupation. President Bush: Actually, I'm asking Israel to negotiate in good faith with an elected leader of the Palestinian Territory to come up with a permanent solution that -- look, the U.N. deal didn't work in the past. And so now we're going to have an opportunity to redefine the future by having a state negotiated between an elected leader of the Palestinian people, as well as the Prime Minister of Israel. This is an opportunity to move forward. And the only way for -- the only way to defeat the terrorists in the long run is to offer an alternative vision that ismore hopeful. And that's what we're attempting to do, sir. We can stay stuck in the past, which will yield nothing good for the Palestinians, in my judgment. We can chart a hopeful future, and that's exactly what this process is intending todo; to redefine the future for the Palestinian citizens and the Israelis. I'm confident that two democratic states living side by side in peace is in the interests not only of the Palestinians and the Israelis, but of the world. The question is whether or not the hard issues can be resolved and the vision emerges, so that the choice is clear amongst the Palestinians -- the choice being, do you want this state, or do you want the status quo? Do you want a future based upon a democratic state, or do you want the same old stuff? And that's a choice that I'm confident that if the Palestinian people are given, they will choosepeace. And so that's what we're trying to do, sir. President Abbas: [As translated.] The settlement for us is considered an obstacle for negotiations, and we have spoke more than once with Mr. Prime Minister Olmert, very frankly. And we also spoke in this meeting with President George Bush, and consequently, the President understood this issue. And we have heard the statements given by the Secretary ofState, Dr. Rice, and she has -- her point of view regarding settlements was very positive. Question: President Bush, Prime Minister Olmert said that peace is not alive here as long as Gaza militants continue their threats on Israel. How do you see, President, about --[inaudible] -- from Gaza? And for you, President Abbas, how do you intend, actually, to get control of Gaza, and do youthink this is possible by the end of the year and by the end of Mr. Bush's presidency? President Bush: First of all, Gaza is a tough situation. I don't know whether you can solve it in a year, or not. But I know this: It can't be solved unless the Prime Minister -- the President has a vision that he can lay out to the people of Gaza that says, here's your choice: Do you want those who have created chaos to run your country, or do you want those of us whonegotiated a settlement with the Israelis that will lead to lasting peace? There is a competing vision taking place in Gaza. And in my judgment, Hamas, which I felt ran on a campaign of, we're going to improve your lives through better education and better health, have delivered nothing but misery. And I'm convinced his government will yield a hopeful future. And the best way to make that abundantly clear is for there to be a visionthat's understandable. See, the past has just been empty words, you know. We -- actually it hasn't been that much - - I'm the only President that's really articulated a two-state solution so far -- but saying two states really doesn't have much bearing until borders are defined, right of return issues resolved, Jerusalem is understood, security measures -- the common security measures will be in place. That's what I'm talking about. I'm talking about a clear, defined state aroundwhich people can rally. And there's going to be -- there will be no better difference, a clear difference, than the vision of Hamas in Gaza and the vision of the President and the Prime Minister and his team based here in Ramallah. And to me, that's how you solve the issue in the long-term. And the definition of long-term, I don't know what it means. I'm not a timetable person -- actually, I am on a timetable -- got 12 months. But I'm impressed by the President's understanding about how a vision and a hopeful future will help clearly define the stakes amongst thePalestinian people. President Abbas: [As translated.] Gaza it is considered a coup by us, we consider it a coup d'etat what happened in Gaza. Now -- we consider it a coup d'etat. And we deal with Gaza at two levels. The first is that we deal with the people as part of us and we take full responsibility that is necessary towards our people. We spend in Gaza 58 percent of our budget. This is notto -- it is our duty towards our people that we provide them with all the need. As for the issue of Hamas, we said that this is a coup and they have to retreat from this coup and they have to recognize international legitimacy, all international legitimacy, and torecognize the Arab Initiative, as well. In this case we will have another talk. President Bush: Thank you, all. Thank you, all.",bush
"diplomatic corps, and distinguished guests: I am honored by the opportunity to stand on Arabsoil and speak to the people of this nation and this region. Throughout the sweep of history, the lands that the Arab people call home have played a pivotal role in world affairs. These lands sit at the juncture of three great continents -- Europe and Asia and Africa. These lands have given birth to three of the world's major religions. These lands have seen the rise and fall of great civilizations. And in the 21st century, theselands are once again playing a central role in the human story. A great new era is unfolding before us. This new era is founded on the equality of all people before God. This new era is being built with the understanding that power is a trust that must be exercised with the consent of the governed -- and deliver equal justice under the law. And this new era offers hope for the millions across the Middle East who yearn for a future ofpeace and progress and opportunity. Here in Abu Dhabi, we see clearly the outlines of this future. Beginning with the revered father of this country -- Sheikh Zayed -- you have succeeded in building a prosperous society out of the desert. You have opened your doors to the world economy. You have encouraged women to contribute to the development of your nation -- and they have occupied some of your highest ministerial posts. You have held historic elections for the Federal National Council. You have shown the world a model of a Muslim state that is tolerant toward people of other faiths. I'm proud to stand in a nation where the people have an opportunity to build a better futurefor themselves and their families. Thank you for your warm hospitality. In my country, we speak of these developments as the advance of freedom. Others may call it the advance of justice. Yet whatever term we use, the ideal is the same. In a free and just society, every person is treated with dignity. In a free and just society, leaders are accountable to those they govern. And in a free and just society, individuals can rise as far astheir talents and hard work will take them. For decades, the people of this region saw their desire for liberty and justice denied at home and dismissed abroad in the name of stability. Today your aspirations are threatened by violent extremists who murder the innocent in pursuit of power. These extremists have hijacked the noble religion of Islam, and seek to impose their totalitarian ideology on millions. They hate freedom and they hate democracy -- because it fosters religious tolerance and allows people to chart their own future. They hate your government because it does not share their dark vision. They hate the United States because they know we stand with you in opposition to their brutal ambitions. And everywhere they go, they use murder and fear tofoment instability to advance their aims. One cause of instability is the extremists supported and embodied by the regime that sits in Tehran. Iran is today the world's leading state sponsor of terror. It sends hundreds of millions of dollars to extremists around the world -- while its own people face repression and economic hardship at home. It undermines Lebanese hopes for peace by arming and aiding the terrorist group Hezbollah. It subverts the hopes for peace in other parts of the region by funding terrorist groups like Hamas and the Palestine Islamic Jihad. It sends arms to the Taliban in Afghanistan and Shia militants in Iraq. It seeks to intimidate its neighbors with ballistic missiles and bellicose rhetoric. And finally, it defies the United Nations and destabilizes the region by refusing to be open and transparent about its nuclear programs and ambitions. Iran's actions threaten the security of nations everywhere. So the United States is strengthening our longstanding security commitments with our friends in the Gulf -- and rallying friends around the world to confrontthis danger before it is too late. The other major cause of instability is the extremists embodied by al Qaeda and its affiliates. On September 11, 2001, al Qaeda murdered nearly 3,000 people on America's home soil. Some of the victims that day were innocent Muslims. And since then, al Qaeda and its allies have killed many more Muslims here in the Middle East -- including women and children. In Afghanistan under the Taliban, on Iraq's Anbar Province, they ruled by intimidation and murder. Their goal is to impose that same dark rule across the Middle East. So they seek to topple your governments, acquire weapons of mass destruction, and drive a wedge between the people of the United States and the people of the Middle East. And they will fail. The United States joins you in your commitment to the freedom and security of this region -- andwe will not abandon you to terrorists or extremists. The fight against the forces of extremism is the great ideological struggle of our time. And in this fight, our nations have a weapon more powerful than bombs or bullets. It is the desire for freedom and justice written into our hearts by Almighty God -- and no terrorist or tyrant can take that away. We see this desire in the 12 million Iraqis who dipped their fingers in purple ink as they voted in defiance of al Qaeda. We see the desire in the Palestinians who elected a President committed to peace and reconciliation. We see this desire in the thousands of Lebanese whose protests helped rid their country of a foreign occupier. And we see this desire in the brave dissidents and journalists who speak out against terror and oppression and injustice. We see this desire in the ordinary people across the Middle East, who are sick of violence, who are sick of corruption, sick of empty promises -- and who choose a free futurewhenever they are given a chance. We also see leaders across this region beginning to respond to the desires of their people -- and take the steps that will help enhance the stability and prosperity of their nations. The recent elections to your Federal National Council represent the first part of a larger reform designed to make your government more modern and more representative. Algeria held its first competitive presidential elections. Kuwait held elections in which women were allowed to vote and hold office for the first time. Citizens have voted in municipal elections in Saudi Arabia, in competitive parliamentary elections in Jordan and Morocco and Bahrain, and in a multiparty presidential election in Yemen. Across the world, the majority of Muslim people live in a free and democratic society - - and the people of the Middle East must continue to work for the day where that is also trueof the lands that Islam first called home. As freedom and justice advance in this part of the world, elections are important, but they're only a start. Free and just societies require strong civic institutions, such as houses of worship, universities, professional associations, local governments and community groups. Free and just societies require habits of self-government that contribute to the rule of law. And free and just societies ultimately depend on the emergence of an engaged public whose citizens feel they have a real stake in their nation's future. All these developments contributeto the bond between government and the governed, between a people and their nation. Free and just societies also create opportunities for their citizens. This opportunity begins with economic growth. In any society, the greatest resource is not the oil in the ground or the minerals beneath the soil. It is the skills and talents of the people. Or as one Nobel winning economist calls this human capital. Across this region, you have an abundance of human capital -- in the men and women who are your citizens. By strengthening your education systems and opening your economies, you will unlock their potential, create vibrant and entrepreneurial societies, and usher in a new era where people have confidence that tomorrowwill bring more opportunities than today. In the last few years, the nations of this region have made some great progress. The World Bank reports that economic growth is strong and it is rising. Saudi Arabia has joined the World Trade Organization. Jordan, Oman, Bahrain, and Morocco have signed free trade agreements with the United States. Your nations are attracting more foreign investment. Oil accounts for much of the economic growth here. But the nations of the Middle East are now investing in their people, and building infrastructure, and opening the door to foreign trade and investment. America supports you in these efforts. We believe that trade and investment is the key to the future of hope and opportunity. We also believe that as we demand you open your markets we should open ours, as well. We're encouraged by the movement towardeconomic freedom that we're seeing across the Middle East. Unfortunately, amid some steps forward in this region we've also seen some setbacks. You cannot build trust when you hold an election where opposition candidates find themselves harassed or in prison. You cannot expect people to believe in the promise of a better future when they are jailed for peacefully petitioning their government. And you cannot stand up amodern and confident nation when you do not allow people to voice their legitimate criticisms. The United States appreciates that democratic progress requires tough choices. Our own history teaches us that the road to freedom is not always even, and democracy does not come overnight. Yet we also know that for all the difficulties, a society based on liberty is worth the sacrifice. We know that democracy is the only form of government that treats individuals with the dignity and equality that is their right. We know from experience that democracy is the only system of government that yields lasting peace and stability. In a democracy, leaders depend on their people -- and most people do not want war and bloodshed and violence. Most people want lives of peace and opportunity. So it is the declared policy of the United States to support these peoples as they claim their freedom -- as a matter of natural right and nationalinterest. I recognize that some people -- including some in my own country -- believe it is a mistake to support democratic freedom in the Middle East. They say that the Arab people are not ""ready"" for democracy. Of course, that is exactly what people said about the Japanese after World War II. Some said that having an Emperor was incompatible with democracy. Some said that the Japanese religion was incompatible with democracy. Some said that advancing freedom in Japan and the Pacific was unwise, because our interests lay in supporting pro-Americanleaders no matter how they ruled their people. Fortunately, America rejected this advice, kept our faith in freedom, and stood with the people of Asia. The results are now in. Today the people of Japan have both a working democracy and a hereditary emperor. They have preserved their traditional religious practices while tolerating the faiths of others. They are surrounded by many democracies that reflect the full diversity of the region. Some of these democracies have constitutional monarchies, some have parliaments, and some have presidents. Some of these democracies have Christian majorities, some have Muslim majorities, some have Hindu or Buddhist majorities. Yet for all the differences, the free nations of Asia all derive their authority from the consent of the governed-- and all know the lasting stability that only freedom can bring. This transformation would not have been possible without America's presence and perseverance over many decades. And just as our commitment to Asia helped people there secure their freedom and prosperity, our commitment to the Middle East will help you achieve yours. And you can know from our record in Asia that our commitment is real, it is strong, andit is lasting. Today America is using its influence to foster peace and reconciliation in the Holy Land. The Israelis have raised a thriving modern society out of rocky soil, and want to live their lives in freedom and security at home and at peace with their neighbors. The Palestinian people aspire to build a nation of their own -- where they can live in dignity and realize their dreams. Today Israelis and Palestinians each understand that the only way to realize their own goals is by helping one another. In other words, an independent, viable, democratic, and peaceful Palestinian state is more than the dream of the Palestinians. It's also the best guarantee for peace for all its neighbors -- and the Israelis understand this. Leaders on both sides still have many tough decisions ahead, and they will need to back these decisions with real commitments. But the time has come for a Holy Land where Palestinian and Israeli livetogether in peace. America will do our part. In Annapolis in November, the United States invited the Israelis and the Palestinians, and other members of the international community to come to a conference. And I appreciate the fact that your country sent a delegate. It was a remarkable thing to see a Palestinian President and an Israeli Prime Minister address a roomful of Arab leaders together. And the result was that the Palestinians and Israelis launched negotiations for theestablishment of a Palestinian state and a broader peace. The talks are just beginning, and our hopes are high. At the beginning of my trip, I met with both Israeli and Palestinian leaders. I was impressed by their commitment to move forward. And by supporting the legitimate aspirations of both sides, we will encourage reconciliation between the Israeli and Palestinian people, foster reconciliation between Israelis and Arabs, and build a foundation for lasting peace that will contribute to the security of every state inthe Gulf. And as you build a Middle East growing in peace and prosperity, the United States will be your partner. As we have done in places from Asia to Europe, we have forged new relationships with friends and allies designed to help you protect your people and your borders. As we have done in places from Asia to Europe, we're helping you bring your economies into the global market. And as we have done in places from Asia to Europe, we have launched programs designed to help you promote economic reform and educational opportunity and politicalparticipation. The United States has no desire for territory. We seek our shared security in your liberty. We believe that stability can only come through a free and just Middle East -- where the extremists are marginalized by millions of moms and dads who want the same opportunitiesfor their children that we have for ours. So today I would like to speak directly to the people of the Middle East. To the Palestinian people: The dignity and sovereignty that is your right is within your reach. In President Abbas, you have a leader who understands that the path forward is through peaceful negotiations. Help him as he makes the tough decisions for peace. Oppose the extremists and terrorists who represent the greatest threat to a Palestinian state. The United States will help you build the institutions of democracy and prosperity -- and make yourdreams of a state come true. To the people of Israel: You know that peace and reconciliation with your neighbors is the best path to long-term security. We believe that peace is possible, though it requires tough decisions. The United States will always stand with Israel in the face of terrorism. And we will support you as you work to ensure the security of your people -- and bring peace andreconciliation to the Holy Land. To the people of Iraq: You have made your choice for democracy, and you have stood firm in face of terrible acts of murder. The terrorists and extremists cannot prevail. They are tormented by the sight of an old man voting, or a young girl going to school -- because they know a successful democracy is a mortal threat to their ambitions. The United States is fighting side by side with Sunni and Shia and Kurd to root out the terrorists and extremists. We have dealt them serious blows. The United States will continue to support you as you buildthe institutions of a free society. And together we'll defeat our common enemies. To the people of Iran: You are rich in culture and talent. You have a right to live under a government that listens to your wishes, respects your talents, and allows you to build better lives for your families. Unfortunately, your government denies you these opportunities, and threatens the peace and stability of your neighbors. So we call on the regime in Tehran to heed your will, and to make itself accountable to you. The day will come when the people of Iran have a government that embraces liberty and justice, and Iran joins the community of free nations. And when that good day comes, you will have no better friend than the UnitedStates of America. To the leaders across the Middle East who are fighting the extremists: The United States will stand with you as you confront the terrorists and radicals. We urge you to join us in committing the resources to help the Palestinians build the institutions of a free society. Help the citizens of Lebanon preserve their government and their sovereignty in the face of outside pressure from their neighbors. Show the Iraqis that you support them in their effort to build a more hopeful nation. And as you do these things, the best way to defeat the extremists in your midst is by opening your societies, and trusting in your people, and giving them a voicein their nation. And finally, to the people of the Middle East: We hear your cries for justice. We share your desire for a free and prosperous future. And as you struggle to find your voice and make yourway in this world, the United States will stand with you. For most of the world, there's no greater symbol of America than the Statue of Liberty. It was designed by a man who traveled widely in this part of the world -- and who had originally envisioned his woman bearing a torch as standing over the Suez Canal. Ultimately, of course, it was erected in New York Harbor, where it has been an inspiration to generations of immigrants. One of these immigrants was a poet-writer named Ameen Rihani. Gazing at her lamp held high, he wondered whether her sister might be erected in the lands of his Arabforefathers. Here is how he put it: ""When will you turn your face toward the East, oh Liberty?"" My friends, a future of liberty stands before you. It is your right. It is your dream. And it isyour destiny.",bush
"Over the past several months I've held a series of meetings with my economic team on the outlook for the U.S. economy. And before I left for the Middle East, I directed them to conduct a thorough assessment of our economic condition, consult with members of Congress, andprovide me with their recommendations about any actions we might need to take. The economic team reports that our economy has a solid foundation, but that there are areas of real concern. Our economy is still creating jobs, though at a reduced pace. Consumer spending is still growing, but the housing market is declining. Business investment andexports are still rising, but the cost of imported oil has increased. My administration has been watching our economy carefully. My advisors and many outside experts expect that our economy will continue to grow over the coming year, but at a slower rate than we have enjoyed for the past few years. And there is a risk of a downturn. Continued instability in the housing and financial markets could cause additional harm to ouroverall economy, and put our growth and job creation in jeopardy. In recent months, we've taken steps to shore up the housing market, including measures to help struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure and to keep their homes. I've also asked Congress to pass legislation to modernize the Federal Housing Administration and enable it to provide additional assistance to struggling homeowners. The House passed a bill and the Senate passed a bill, and now they need to get together and get a bill to my desk as quicklyas possible. After careful consideration, and after discussions with members of Congress, I have concluded that additional action is needed. To keep our economy growing and creating jobs, Congress and the administration need to work to enact an economic growth package as soon aspossible. As Congress considers such a plan, there are certain principles that must guide its deliberations: This growth package must be big enough to make a difference in an economy as large and dynamic as ours -- which means it should be about 1 percent of GDP. This growth package must be built on broad-based tax relief that will directly affect economic growth -- and not the kind of spending projects that would have little immediate impact on our economy. This growth package must be temporary and take effect right away -- so we can get help to our economy when it needs it most. And this growth package must not include anytax increases. Specifically, this growth package should bolster both business investment and consumer spending, which are critical to economic growth. And this would require two key provisions: To be effective, a growth package must include tax incentives for American businesses, including small businesses, to make major investments in their enterprises this year. Giving them an incentive to invest now will encourage business owners to expand theiroperations, create new jobs, and inject new energy into our economy in the process. To be effective, a growth package must also include direct and rapid income tax relief for the American people. Americans could use this money as they see fit -- to help meet their monthly bills, cover higher costs at the gas pump, or pay for other basic necessities. Letting Americans keep more of their own money should increase consumer spending, and lift oureconomy at a time when people otherwise might spend less. Yesterday, I spoke to members of the congressional leadership from both political parties. They shared with me their thoughts on the best way forward. And I was encouraged by those discussions and I believe there is enough broad consensus that we can come up with a package that can be approved with bipartisan support. I've asked Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson to lead my administration's efforts to forge an agreement with Congress, so that wecan deliver this needed boost to our economy as quickly as possible. Passing a new growth package is our most pressing economic priority. When that is done, Congress must turn to the most important economic priority for our country, and that's making sure the tax relief that is now in place is not taken away. A source of uncertainty in our economy is that this tax relief is set to expire at the end of 2010. Unless Congress acts, the American people will face massive tax increases in less than three years. The marriage penalty will make a comeback; the child tax credit will be cut in half; the death tax will come back to life; and tax rates will go up on regular income, capital gains, and dividends. This tax increase would put jobs and economic growth at risk, and Congress has a responsibility tokeep that from happening. So it's critical that Congress make this tax relief permanent. We're in the midst of a challenging period, and I know Americans are concerned about oureconomic future. But our economy has seen challenging times before -- and it is resilient. In a vibrant economy, markets rise and decline. We cannot change that fundamental dynamic. As a matter of fact, eliminating risk altogether would also eliminate the innovation and productivity that drives the creation of jobs and wealth in America. Yet there are also times when swift and temporary actions can help ensure that inevitable market adjustments do notundermine the health of the broader economy. This is such a moment. By passing an effective growth package quickly, we can provide a shot in the arm to keep a fundamentally strong economy healthy. And it will help keep economic sectors that are going through adjustments, such as the housing market, from adversely affecting other parts of oureconomy. I'm optimistic about our economic future, because Americans have shown time and again that they are the most industrious, creative, and enterprising people in the world. That is what hasmade our economy strong. That is what will make it stronger in the challenging times ahead. Thank you.",bush
"The issue of research involving stem cells derived from human embryos is increasingly the subject of a national debate and dinner table discussions. The issue is confronted every day in laboratories as scientists ponder the ethical ramifications of their work. It is agonized over by parents and many couples as they try to have children or to save children already born. The issue is debated within the church, with people of different faiths, even many of the samefaith, coming to different conclusions. Many people are finding that the more they know about stem cell research, the less certainthey are about the right ethical and moral conclusions. My administration must decide whether to allow federal funds, your tax dollars, to be used forscientific research on stem cells derived from human embryos. A large number of these embryos already exist. They are the product of a process called in vitro fertilization which helps so many couples conceive children. When doctors match sperm and egg to create life outside the womb, they usually produce more embryos than are implanted in the mother. Once a couple successfully has children or if they are unsuccessful, the additional embryos remain frozen in laboratories. Some will not survive during long storage, others are destroyed. A number have been donated to science and used to create privately funded stem cell lines. And a few have been implanted in anadoptive mother and born and are today healthy children. Based on preliminary work that has been privately funded, scientists believe further research using stem cells offers great promise that could help improve the lives of those who suffer from many terrible diseases, from juvenile diabetesto Alzheimer, from Parkinsons to spinal cord injuries. And while scientists admit they are not yet certain, they believe stem cellsderived from embryos have unique potential. You should also know that stem cells can be derived from sources other than embryos: from adult cells, from umbilical cords that are discarded after babies are born, from human placentas. And many scientists feel research on these types of stem cells is also promising. Many patients suffering from a range of diseases are already being helped with treatmentsdeveloped from adult stem cells. However, most scientists, at least today, believe that research on embryonic stem cells offers the most promise because these cells have the potential to develop in all of the tissues in thebody. Scientists further believe that rapid progress in this research will come only with federal funds. Federal dollars help attract the best and brightest scientists. They ensure new discoveries are widely shared at the largest number of research facilities, and that the research is directedtoward the greatest public good. The United States has a long and proud record of leading the world toward advances in science and medicine that improve human life, and the United States has a long and proud record of upholding the highest standards of ethics as we expand the limits of science andknowledge. Research on embryonic stem cells raises profound ethical questions, because extracting thestem cell destroys the embryo, and thus destroys its potential for life. Like a snowflake, each of these embryos is unique, with the unique genetic potential of anindividual human being. As I thought through this issue I kept returning to two fundamental questions. First, are these frozen embryos human life and therefore something precious to be protected? And second, if they're going to be destroyed anyway, shouldn't they be used for a greater good, for researchthat has the potential to save and improve other lives? I've asked those questions and others of scientists, scholars, bio-ethicists, religious leaders, doctors, researchers, members of Congress, my Cabinet and my friends. I have read heartfelt letters from many Americans. I have given this issue a great deal of thought, prayer, andconsiderable reflection, and I have found widespread disagreement. On the first issue, are these embryos human life? Well, one researcher told me he believes this five-day-old cluster of cells is not an embryo, not yet an individual but a pre-embryo. He argued that it has the potential for life, but it is not a life because it cannot develop on itsown. An ethicist dismissed that as a callous attempt at rationalization. ""Make no mistake,"" he told me, ""that cluster of cells is the same way you and I, and all the rest of us, started our lives. One goes with a heavy heart if we use these,"" he said, ""because we are dealing with the seedsof the next generation."" And to the other crucial question -- If these are going to be destroyed anyway, why not usethem for good purpose? -- I also found different answers. Many are these embryos are byproducts of a process that helps create life and we should allow couples to donate them to science so they can be used for good purpose instead of wasting their potential. Others will argue there is no such thing as excess life and the fact that a living being is goingto die does not justify experimenting on it or exploiting it as a natural resource. At its core, this issue forces us to confront fundamental questions about the beginnings of life and the ends of science. It lives at a difficult moral intersection, juxtaposing the need toprotect life in all its phases with the prospect of saving and improving life in all its stages. As the discoveries of modern science create tremendous hope, they also lay vast ethical minefields. As the genius of science extends the horizons of what we can do, we increasingly confront complex questions about what we should do. We have arrived at that brave new world that seemed so distant in 1932 when Alduous Huxley wrote about human beings created in testtubes in what he called a hatchery. In recent weeks, we learned that scientists have created human embryos in test tubes solely to experiment on them. This is deeply troubling and a warning sign that should prompt all ofus to think through these issues very carefully. Embryonic stem cell research is at the leading edge of a series of moral hazards. The initial stem cell researcher was at first reluctant to begin his research, fearing it might be used for human cloning. Scientists have already cloned a sheep. Researchers are telling us the next step could be to clone human beings to create individual designer stem cells, essentially togrow another you, to be available in case you need another heart or lung or liver. I strongly oppose human cloning, as do most Americans. We recoil at the idea of growinghuman beings for spare body parts or creating life for our convenience. And while we must devote enormous energy to conquering disease, it is equally important that we pay attention to the moral concerns raised by the new frontier of human embryo stemcell research. Even the most noble ends do not justify any means. My position on these issues is shaped by deeply held beliefs. I'm a strong supporter of science and technology, and believe they have the potential for incredible good -- to improve lives, to save life, to conquer disease. Research offers hope that millions of our loved ones may be cured of a disease and rid of their suffering. I have friends whose children suffer from juvenile diabetes. Nancy Reagan has written me about President Reagan's struggle with Alzheimer's. My own family has confronted the tragedy of childhood leukemia. And like all Americans, Ihave great hope for cures. I also believe human life is a sacred gift from our creator. I worry about a culture that devalues life, and believe as your president I have an important obligation to foster andencourage respect for life in America and throughout the world. And while we're all hopeful about the potential of this research, no one can be certain that thescience will live up to the hope it has generated. Eight years ago, scientists believed fetal tissue research offered great hope for cures and treatments, yet the progress to date has not lived up to its initial expectations. Embryonic stem cell research offers both great promise and great peril, so I have decided we mustproceed with great care. As a result of private research, more than 60 genetically diverse stem cell lines already exist. They were created from embryos that have already been destroyed, and they have the abilityto regenerate themselves indefinitely, creating ongoing opportunities for research. I have concluded that we should allow federal funds to be used for research on these existingstem cell lines, where the life-and- death decision has already been made. Leading scientists tell me research on these 60 lines has great promise that could lead to breakthrough therapies and cures. This allows us to explore the promise and potential of stem cell research without crossing a fundamental moral line by providing taxpayer funding that would sanction or encourage further destruction of human embryos that have at least the potentialfor life. I also believe that great scientific progress can be made through aggressive federal funding of research on umbilical cord, placenta, adult and animal stem cells, which do not involve the same moral dilemma. This year your government will spent $250 million on this importantresearch. I will also name a president's council to monitor stem cell research, to recommend appropriate guidelines and regulations and to consider all of the medical and ethical ramifications of bio- medical innovation. This council will consist of leading scientists, doctors, ethicists, lawyers, theologians and others, and will be chaired by Dr. Leon Cass, a leading bio-medical ethicist from the Universityof Chicago. This council will keep us apprised of new developments and give our nation a forum tocontinue to discuss and evaluate these important issues. As we go forward, I hope we will always be guided by both intellect and heart, by both ourcapabilities and our conscience. I have made this decision with great care, and I pray it is the right one. Thank you for listening. Good night, and God bless America.",bush
"Thank you all. Deputy Secretary England, thanks for the introduction. One boss may not be here, but the other one is. I appreciate your kind words. I'm pleased to be back here with themen and women of the Defense Department. On this day in 2003, the United States began Operation Iraqi Freedom. As the campaign unfolded, tens and thousands of our troops poured across the Iraqi border to liberate the Iraqipeople and remove a regime that threatened free nations. Five years into this battle, there is an understandable debate over whether the war was worth fighting, whether the fight is worth winning, and whether we can win it. The answers are clear to me: Removing Saddam Hussein from power was the right decision -- and this is a fightAmerica can and must win. The men and women who crossed into Iraq five years ago removed a tyrant, liberated a country, and rescued millions from unspeakable horrors. Some of those troops are with us today, and you need to know that the American people are proud of your accomplishment --and so is the Commander in Chief. I appreciate Admiral Mullen, the Joint Chiefs who are here. Thanks for coming. Secretary Donald Winter of the Navy. Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte is with us. Admiral Thad Allen of the Coast Guard is with us. Ambassador from Iraq is with us -- Mr. Ambassador, we're proud to have you here. Soldiers, Sailors, Marines, Airmen and Coastmen -- Coast Guardmen [sic], thanks for coming, thanks for wearing the uniform. Men and women of theDepartment of State are here as well. Operation Iraqi Freedom was a remarkable display of military effectiveness. Forces from the UK, Australia, Poland and other allies joined our troops in the initial operations. As they advanced, our troops fought their way through sand storms so intense that they blackened the daytime sky. Our troops engaged in pitched battles with the Fedayeen Saddam -- death squads acting on the orders of Saddam Hussein that obeyed neither the conventions of war nor the dictates of conscience. These death squads hid in schools and they hid in hospitals, hoping to draw fire against Iraqi civilians. They used women and children as human shields. They stopped at nothing in their efforts to prevent us from prevailing -- but they couldn't stopthe coalition advance. Aided by the most effective and precise air campaign in history, coalition forces raced across 350 miles of enemy territory -- destroying Republican Guard Divisions, pushing through the Karbala Gap, capturing Saddam International Airport, and liberating Baghdad in less than onemonth. Along the way, our troops added new chapters to the story of American military heroism. During these first weeks of battle, Army Sergeant First Class Paul Ray Smith and his troops came under a surprise attack by about a hundred Republican Guard forces. Sergeant Smith rallied his men; he led a counterattack -- killing as many as 50 enemy soldiers before being fatally wounded. His actions saved the lives of more than a hundredAmerican troops -- and earned him the Medal of Honor. Today, in light of the challenges we have faced in Iraq, some look back and call this period the easy part of the war. Yet there was nothing easy about it. The liberation of Iraq took incredible skill and amazing courage. And the speed, precision and brilliant execution of thecampaign will be studied by military historians for years to come. What our troops found in Iraq following Saddam's removal was horrifying. They uncovered children's prisons, and torture chambers, and rape rooms where Iraqi women were violated in front of their families. They found videos showing regime thugs mutilating Iraqis deemed disloyal to Saddam. And across the Iraqi countryside they uncovered mass graves ofthousands executed by the regime. Because we acted, Saddam Hussein no longer fills fields with the remains of innocent men, women and children. Because we acted, Saddam's torture chambers and rape rooms and children's prisons have been closed for good. Because we acted, Saddam's regime is no longer invading its neighbors or attacking them with chemical weapons and ballistic missiles. Because we acted, Saddam's regime is no longer paying the families of suicide bombers in the Holy Land. Because we acted, Saddam's regime is no longer shooting at American and British aircraft patrolling the no-fly zones and defying the will of the United Nations. Because weacted, the world is better and United States of America is safer. When the Iraqi regime was removed, it did not lay down its arms and surrender. Instead, former regime elements took off their uniforms and faded into the countryside to fight the emergence of a free Iraq. And then they were joined by foreign terrorists who were seeking to stop the advance of liberty in the Middle East and seeking to establish safe havens from whichto plot new attacks across the world. The battle in Iraq has been longer and harder and more costly than we anticipated -- but it is a fight we must win. So our troops have engaged these enemies with courage and determination. And as they've battled the terrorists and extremists in Iraq, they have helped the Iraqi people reclaim their nation, and helped a young democracy rise from the rubble ofSaddam Hussein's tyranny. Over the past five years, we have seen moments of triumph and moments of tragedy. We have watched in admiration as 12 million Iraqis defied the terrorists and went to the polls, and chose their leaders in free elections. We have watched in horror as al Qaeda beheaded innocent captives, and sent suicide bombers to blow up mosques and markets. These actions show the brutal nature of the enemy in Iraq. And they serve as a grim reminder: The terrorists who murder the innocent in the streets of Baghdad want to murder the innocent in the streets of America. Defeating this enemy in Iraq will make it less likely that we'll face theenemy here at home. A little over a year ago, the fight in Iraq was faltering. Extremist elements were succeeding in their efforts to plunge Iraq into chaos. They had established safe havens in many parts of the country. They were creating divisions among the Iraqis along sectarian lines. And their strategy of using violence in Iraq to cause divisions in America was working -- as pressuresbuilt here in Washington for withdrawal before the job was done. My Administration understood that America could not retreat in the face of terror. And we knew that if we did not act, the violence that had been consuming Iraq would worsen, and spread, and could eventually reach genocidal levels. Baghdad could have disintegrated into acontagion of killing, and Iraq could have descended into full-blown sectarian warfare. So we reviewed the strategy -- and changed course in Iraq. We sent reinforcements into the country in a dramatic policy shift that is now known as ""the surge."" General David Petraeus took command with a new mission: Work with Iraqi forces to protect the Iraqi people, pressure [sic] the enemy into strongholds, and deny the terrorists sanctuary anywhere in thecountry. And that is precisely what we have done. In Anbar, Sunni tribal leaders had grown tired of al Qaeda's brutality and started a popular uprising, called the ""Anbar Awakening."" To take advantage of this opportunity, we sent 4,000 additional Marines to help these brave Iraqis drive al Qaeda from the province. As this effort succeeded, it inspired other Iraqis to take up the fight. Soon similar uprisings began to spread across the country. Today there are more than 90,000 concerned local citizens who are protecting their communities from the terrorists and insurgents and the extremists. The government in Baghdad has stepped forward with a surge of its own -- they've added more than 100,000 new Iraqi soldiers and police during the past year. These Iraqi troops havefought bravely, and thousands have given their lives in this struggle. Together, these Americans and Iraqi forces have driven the terrorists from many of the sanctuaries they once held. Now the terrorists have gathered in and around the northern Iraqi city of Mosul -- and Iraqi and American forces are relentlessly pursuing them. There will be tough fighting in Mosul and areas of northern Iraq in the weeks ahead. But there's no doubt in my mind, because of the courage of our troops and the bravery of the Iraqis, the al Qaedaterrorists in this region will suffer the same fate as al Qaeda suffered elsewhere in Iraq. As we have fought al Qaeda, coalition and Iraqi forces have also taken the fight to Shia extremist groups -- many of them backed and financed and armed by Iran. A year ago these groups were on the rise. Today, they are increasingly isolated, and Iraqis of all faiths areputting their lives on the line to stop these extremists from hijacking their young democracy. To ensure that military progress in Iraq is quickly followed up with real improvements in daily life, we have doubled the number of provincial reconstruction teams in Iraq. These teams of civilian experts are serving all Iraqi -- 18 Iraqi provinces, and they're helping to strengthen responsible leaders, and build up local economies, and bring Iraqis together so that reconciliation can happen from the ground up. They're very effective. They're helping give ordinary Iraqis confidence that by rejecting the extremists and reconciling with one another,they can claim their place in a free Iraq -- and build better lives for their families. There's still hard work to be done in Iraq. The gains we have made are fragile and reversible. But on this anniversary, the American people should know that since the surge began, the level of violence is significantly down, civilian deaths are down, sectarian killings are down, attacks on American forces are down. We have captured or killed thousands of extremists in Iraq, including hundreds of key al Qaeda leaders and operatives. Our men and women in uniform are performing with characteristic honor and valor. The surge is working. And as areturn on our success in Iraq, we've begun bringing some of our troops home. The surge has done more than turn the situation in Iraq around -- it has opened the door to a major strategic victory in the broader war on terror. For the terrorists, Iraq was supposed to be the place where al Qaeda rallied Arab masses to drive America out. Instead, Iraq has become the place where Arabs joined with Americans to drive al Qaeda out. In Iraq, we are witnessing the first large-scale Arab uprising against Osama bin Laden, his grim ideology, andhis murderous network. And the significance of this development cannot be overstated. The terrorist movement feeds on a sense of inevitability, and claims to rise on the tide of history. The accomplishments of the surge in Iraq are exposing this myth and discrediting the extremists. When Iraqi and American forces finish the job, the effects will reverberate far beyond Iraq's borders. Osama bin Laden once said: ""When people see a strong horse and a weak horse, by nature they will like the strong horse."" By defeating al Qaeda in Iraq, we will show the world that al Qaeda is the weak horse. We will show that men and women who love liberty can defeat the terrorists. And we will show that the future of the Middle East does notbelong to terror -- the future of the Middle East belongs to freedom. The challenge in the period ahead is to consolidate the gains we have made and seal the extremists' defeat. We have learned through hard experience what happens when we pull our forces back too fast -- the terrorists and extremists step in, they fill vacuums, establish safe havens, and use them to spread chaos and carnage. General Petraeus has warned that too fast a drawdown could result in such an unraveling -- with al Qaeda and insurgents and militiaextremists regaining lost ground and increasing violence. Men and women of the Armed Forces: Having come so far, and achieved so much, we're notgoing to let this to happen. Next month, General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker will come to Washington to testify before Congress. I will await their recommendations before making decisions on our troop levels in Iraq. Any further drawdown will be based on conditions on the ground and the recommendations of our commanders -- and they must not jeopardize the hard-fought gainsour troops and civilians have made over the past year. The successes we are seeing in Iraq are undeniable -- yet some in Washington still call for retreat. War critics can no longer credibly argue that we're losing in Iraq -- so now they argue the war costs too much. In recent months we've heard exaggerated estimates of the costs of this war. No one would argue that this war has not come at a high cost in lives and treasure -- but those costs are necessary when we consider the cost of a strategic victory for our enemiesin Iraq. If we were to allow our enemies to prevail in Iraq, the violence that is now declining would accelerate -- and Iraq would descend into chaos. Al Qaeda would regain its lost sanctuaries and establish new ones -- fomenting violence and terror that could spread beyond Iraq'sborders, with serious consequences for the world's economy. Out of such chaos in Iraq, the terrorist movement could emerge emboldened -- with new recruits, new resources, and an even greater determination to dominate the region and harm America. An emboldened al Qaeda with access to Iraq's oil resources could pursue its ambitions to acquire weapons of mass destruction to attack America and other free nations. Iran would be emboldened as well -- with a renewed determination to develop nuclear weapons and impose its brand of hegemony across the Middle East. Our enemies would seean America -- an American failure in Iraq as evidence of weakness and a lack of resolve. To allow this to happen would be to ignore the lessons of September the 11th and make it more likely that America would suffer another attack like the one we experienced that day -- a day in which 19 armed men with box cutters killed nearly 3,000 people in our -- on our soil; a day after which in the following of that attack more than one million Americans lost work, lost their jobs. The terrorists intend even greater harm to our country. And we have no greater responsibility than to defeat our enemies across the world so that they cannot carry out suchan attack. As our coalition fights the enemy in Iraq, we've stayed on the offensive on other fronts in the war on terror. Just a few weeks before commencing Operation Iraqi Freedom, U.S. forces captured Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind behind the September the 11th terrorist attacks; we got him in Pakistan. About the same time as we launched Operation Iraqi Freedom, coalition forces, thousands of -- hundreds of miles away launched an assault on the terrorists in the mountains of southern Afghanistan in an operation called Operation ValiantStrike. Throughout the war on terror, we have brought the enemy -- we have fought the enemy on every single battlefront. And so long as the terrorist danger remains, the United States of America will continue to fight the enemy wherever it makes its stand. We will stay on theoffense. But in the long run, defeating the terrorists requires an alternative to their murderous ideology. And there we have another advantage -- we've got a singular advantage with our military when it comes to finding the terrorists and bringing them to justice. And we haveanother advantage in our strong belief in the transformative power of liberty. So we're helping the people of Iraq establish a democracy in the heart of the Middle East. A free Iraq will fight terrorists instead of harboring them. A free Iraq will be an example for others of the power of liberty to change the societies and to displace despair with hope. By spreading the hope of liberty in the Middle East, we will help free societies take root -- andwhen they do, freedom will yield the peace that we all desire. Our troops on the front lines understand what is at stake. They know that the mission in Iraq has been difficult and has been trying for our nation -- because they're the ones who've carried most of the burdens. They are all volunteers, who have stepped forward to defend America in a time of danger -- and some of them have gone out of their way to return to thefight. One of these brave Americans is a Marine Gunnery Sergeant named William ""Spanky"" Gibson. In May of 2006 in Ramadi, a terrorist sniper's bullet ripped through his left knee -- doctors then amputated his leg. After months of difficult rehabilitation, Spanky was not only walking --he was training for triathlons. Last year, at the ""Escape from Alcatraz"" swim near San Francisco, he met Marine General James Mattis, who asked if there's anything he could do for him. Spanky had just one request: He asked to re-deploy to Iraq. Today he's serving in Fallujah -- the first full-leg amputee to return to the front lines. Here's what he says about his decision to return: The Iraqis are where we were 232 years ago as a nation. Now they're starting a new nation, and that's one of my big reasons for coming back here. I wanted to tell the people of this countrythat I'm back to help wherever I can. When Americans like Spanky Gibson serve on our side, the enemy in Iraq doesn't got a chance. We're grateful to all the brave men and women of our military who have served the cause of freedom. You've done the hard work, far from home and from your loved ones. Wegive thanks for all our military families who love you and have supported you in this mission. We appreciate the fine civilians from many departments who serve alongside you. Many of you served in Iraq and Afghanistan -- and some have been on these fronts several times. You will never forget the people who fought at your side. You will always remember the comrades who served with you in combat [but] did not make the journey home. America remembers them as well. More than 4,400 men and women have given their lives in the war on terror.We'll pray for their families. We'll always honor their memory. The best way we can honor them is by making sure that their sacrifice was not in vain. Five years ago tonight, I promised the American people that in the struggle ahead ""we will accept no outcome but victory."" Today, standing before men and women who helped liberate a nation, I reaffirm the commitment. The battle in Iraq is noble, it is necessary, and it is just.And with your courage, the battle in Iraq will end in victory. God bless.",bush
"Holy Father, Laura and I are privileged to have you here at the White House. We welcome youwith the ancient words commended by Saint Augustine: ""Pax Tecum."" Peace be with you. You've chosen to visit America on your birthday. Well, birthdays are traditionally spent withclose friends, so our entire nation is moved and honored that you've decided to share thisspecial day with us. We wish you much health and happiness -- today and for many years tocome. This is your first trip to the United States since you ascended to the Chair of Saint Peter. Youwill visit two of our greatest cities and meet countless Americans, including many who havetraveled from across the country to see with you and to share in the joy of this visit. Here inAmerica you'll find a nation of prayer. Each day millions of our citizens approach our Maker onbended knee, seeking His grace and giving thanks for the many blessings He bestows uponus. Millions of Americans have been praying for your visit, and millions look forward to prayingwith you this week. Here in America you'll find a nation of compassion. Americans believe that the measure of afree society is how we treat the weakest and most vulnerable among us. So each day citizensacross America answer the universal call to feed the hungry and comfort the sick and care forthe infirm. Each day across the world the United States is working to eradicate disease,alleviate poverty, promote peace and bring the light of hope to places still mired in thedarkness of tyranny and despair. Here in America you'll find a nation that welcomes the role of faith in the public square. Whenour Founders declared our nation's independence, they rested their case on an appeal to the""laws of nature, and of nature's God."" We believe in religious liberty. We also believe that alove for freedom and a common moral law are written into every human heart, and that theseconstitute the firm foundation on which any successful free society must be built. Here in America, you'll find a nation that is fully modern, yet guided by ancient and eternaltruths. The United States is the most innovative, creative and dynamic country on earth -- itis also among the most religious. In our nation, faith and reason coexist in harmony. This isone of our country's greatest strengths, and one of the reasons that our land remains abeacon of hope and opportunity for millions across the world. Most of all, Holy Father, you will find in America people whose hearts are open to yourmessage of hope. And America and the world need this message. In a world where someinvoke the name of God to justify acts of terror and murder and hate, we need your messagethat ""God is love."" And embracing this love is the surest way to save men from ""falling prey tothe teaching of fanaticism and terrorism."" In a world where some treat life as something to be debased and discarded, we need yourmessage that all human life is sacred, and that ""each of us is willed, each of us is loved"" --and your message that ""each of us is willed, each of us is loved, and each of us is necessary."" In a world where some no longer believe that we can distinguish between simple right andwrong, we need your message to reject this ""dictatorship of relativism,"" and embrace aculture of justice and truth. In a world where some see freedom as simply the right to do as they wish, we need yourmessage that true liberty requires us to live our freedom not just for ourselves, but ""in a spiritof mutual support."" Holy Father, thank you for making this journey to America. Our nation welcomes you. Weappreciate the example you set for the world, and we ask that you always keep us in yourprayers.",bush
"I just signed a -- a bill passed by the leaders of the Senate and House who have joined me tohonor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi with the Congressional Gold Medal. This is a fitting tribute to a courageous woman who speaks for freedom for all the people of Burma, and who speaks in such a way that she's a powerful voice in contrast to the junta thatcurrently rules the country. Burma has been hit by a terrible natural disaster. Laura and I and members of the Senate andHouse here express our heartfelt sympathy to the people of Burma. The United States has made an initial aid contribution, but we want to do a lot more. We're prepared to move U.S. Navy assets to help find those who've lost their lives, to help find the missing, to help stabilize the situation. But in order to do so, the military junta must allow ourdisaster assessment teams into the country. So our message is to the military rulers: Let the United States come and help you, help thepeople. Our hearts go out to the people of Burma. We want to help them deal with this terribledisaster. At the same time, of course, we want them to live in a free society. I want to thank you for your leadership, thank you for your determination to send a messagethat America stands with this courageous woman. Thank you.",bush
"President Peres, thank you, sir, for your hospitality. Mr. Prime Minister and Mrs. Olmert, it's great to be with you. We consider you friends. Heads of state, thank you all for coming. I think it's a great tribute to this conference, as well as to Israel that so many heads of state have come. Ex-heads of state and ex-leaders, thanks for being here. Save a seat in the ex- leader's club. Citizens of Israel, Laura and I loved coming to your beautiful country, and thank you for your warm hospitality. Citizens of the United States, my fellow Americans: Spendfreely and behave yourselves. Distinguished guests, I really appreciate your warm welcome; and we are thrilled to be here with one of America's closest friends. Laura and I are honored to represent the Americanpeople on the 60th anniversary of your independence. Happy birthday. As we celebrate the anniversary, it is useful to look back at the story of your founding. It is a story of how faith guided the Jewish people through centuries of bitter exile. It is a story of how those living behind ghetto walls and barbed wire never lost sight of Jerusalem. It is a story of how brave pioneers risked everything to redeem the promise of this land. It is amarvelous story. When Israel's founders gathered in Tel Aviv to sign your declaration of independence, the threat of war loomed. But it could not overshadow the joy of people who had lived to see their prayers answered. Celebrations broke out all across this land, and of course they broke out in America, as well. In New York, young men and women danced the Hora in the streets. In Washington, a crowd gathered to watch a flag-raising ceremony outside the building that would become Israel's first embassy. After one man saw the flag bearing the Star of David, hesaid, ""I never thought I'd live to see this day."" Looking back 60 years later, it is important to remember what the founders of Israel had to overcome at every stage of the journey. They established one of the world's great democracies in a region where democracy had few roots. They formed a unified army out of immigrants and refugees from many different countries. They planted the seeds of a modern economy in the sands of an ancient desert. In these accomplishments, we see the visionary leadership of men and women like Herzl and Weizmann and Ben-Gurion and Golda Meir andRabin and Sharon -- and we honor each of them this evening. And looking back 60 years later, we've also got to remember the courage of President Harry S. Truman. As Israel prepared to declare independence, President Truman faced a tough choice over whether to recognize a new state. The future of Israel hung in the balance. As Chaim Weizmann told the President, he said, ""History and providence have placed this issue in your hands."" And today we know that the forces of Providence could not have chosen a betterman than America's 33rd President. Eleven minutes after Israel came into existence, the United States became the first nation to recognize its independence. And because Harry Truman did what was right instead of following the conventional wisdom, we can say today that America is Israel's oldest and bestfriend in the world. With every passing year, the bonds of friendship between America and Israel have grown stronger. America stands for peace, and so does Israel. And as we stand in peace, we must understand the realities of the world in which we live. We must be steadfast, and we must be strong in the face of those who murder the innocent to achieve their objectives. And in the long run, we share a powerful belief in a powerful weapon against the terrorists. We believe that the surest way to defeat the enemies of hatred is to advance the cause of hope to thecause of freedom -- liberty as the great alternative to tyranny and terror. Mr. President, and Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for inviting me to speak at the Knesset tomorrow. I hear it's a place of many a sharp elbow. I'm looking forward to giving my speech. I'm not going to be throwing any elbows. But I will talk about the day when I believe every child in the Middle East can live in peace and live in freedom. With trust in the Rock of Israel, we know that day will come. And when it does, the United States of Americawill be at your side. God bless Israel, and God bless America.",bush
"President Peres and Mr. Prime Minister, Madam Speaker, thank very much for hosting this special session. President Beinish, Leader of the Opposition, Netanyahu, Ministers, membersof the Knesset, distinguished guests: Shalom. Laura and I are thrilled to be back in Israel. We have been deeply moved by the celebrations of the past two days. And this afternoon, I'm honored to stand before one of the world's greatest democratic assemblies and convey the wishes of the American people with thesewords: Yom Ha'atzmaut Sameach.1 It is a -- It is a rare privilege -- It's a rare privilege for the American President to speak to the Knesset. Although the Prime Minister told me there's something even rarer -- to have just one person in this chamber speaking at a time. My only regret is that one of Israel's greatest leaders is not here to share this moment. He's a warrior for the ages, a man of peace, afriend. The prayers of the American people are with Ariel Sharon. We gather to mark a momentous occasion. Sixty years ago in Tel Aviv, David Ben-Gurion proclaimed Israel's independence, founded on the ""natural right of the Jewish people to be masters of their own fate."" What followed was more than the establishment of a new country. It was the redemption of an ancient promise given to Abraham and Moses and David -- ahomeland for the chosen people Eretz Yisrael.2 Eleven minutes later, on the orders of President Harry Truman, the United States was proud to be the first nation to recognize Israel's independence. And on this landmark anniversary,America is proud to be Israel's closest ally and best friend in the world. The alliance between our governments is unbreakable, yet the source of our friendship runs deeper than any treaty. It is grounded in the shared spirit of our people, the bonds of the Book, the ties of the soul. When William Bradford stepped off the Mayflower in 1620, he quoted the words of Jeremiah: ""Come let us declare in Zion the word of God."" The founders of my country saw a new Promised Land and bestowed upon their towns names like Bethlehem and New Canaan. And in time, many Americans became passionate advocates for a Jewishstate. Centuries of suffering and sacrifice would pass before the dream was fulfilled. The Jewish people endured the agony of the pogroms, the tragedy of the Great War, and the horror of the Holocaust -- what Elie Wiesel called ""the kingdom of the night."" Soulless men took away lives and broke apart families. Yet they could not take away the spirit of the Jewish people, and they could not break the promise of God. When news of Israel's freedom finally arrived, Golda Meir, a fearless woman raised in Wisconsin, could summon only tears. She later said: ""For two thousand years we have waited for our deliverance. Now that it is here it is so great andwonderful that it surpasses human words."" The joy of independence was tempered by the outbreak of battle, a struggle that has continued for six decades. Yet in spite of the violence, in defiance of the threats, Israel has built a thriving democracy in the heart of the Holy Land. You have welcomed immigrants from far -- from the four corners of the Earth. You have forged a free and modern society based on the love of liberty, a passion for justice, and a respect for human dignity. You have workedtirelessly for peace. You have fought valiantly for freedom. My country's admiration for Israel does not end there. When Americans look at Israel, we see a pioneer spirit that worked an agricultural miracle and now leads a high-tech revolution. We see world-class universities and a global leader in business and innovation and the arts. We see a resource more valuable than oil or gold: the talent and determination of a free peoplewho refuse to let any obstacle stand in the way of their destiny. I've been fortunate to see the character of Israel up close. I've touched the Western Wall. I've seen the sun reflected in the Sea of Galilee. I have prayed at Yad -- Yad Vashem. And earlier today I visited Masada, an inspiring monument to courage and sacrifice. At this historic site, Israeli soldiers swear an oath: ""Masada shall never fall again."" Citizens of Israel: Masada shallnever fall again, and America will be at your side. This anniversary is a time to reflect on the past. It's also an opportunity to look to the future. As we go forward, our alliance will be guided by clear principles -- shared convictions rooted inmoral clarity and unswayed by popularity polls or the shifting opinions of international elites. We believe in the matchless value of every man, woman, and child: So we insist that the people of Israel have the right to a decent, normal, and peaceful life, just like thecitizens of every other nation. We believe that democracy is the only way to ensure human rights: So we consider it a source of shame that the United Nations routinely passes more human rights resolutions against the freest democracy in the Middle East than any other nation inthe world. We believe that religious liberty is fundamental to a civilized society: So we condemn anti-Semitism in all forms -- whether by those who openly question Israel's right toexist, or by others who quietly excuse them. We believe that free people should strive and sacrifice for peace: So we applaud the courageous choices Israeli's leaders have made. We also believe that nations have a right to defend themselves and that no nation should ever be forced to negotiate withkillers pledged to its destruction. We believe that targeting innocent lives to achieve political objectives is always and everywhere wrong: So we stand together against terror and extremism, and we willnever let down our guard or lose our resolve. The fight against terror and extremism is the defining challenge of our time. It's more than a clash of arms. It's a clash of visions, a great ideological struggle. On the one side are those who defend the ideals of justice and dignity with the power of reason and truth. On the other side are those who pursue a narrow vision of cruelty and control by committing murder,inciting fear, and spreading lies. This struggle is waged with the technology of the 21st century, but at its core it is an ancient battle between good and evil. The killers claim the mantle of Islam, but they are not religious men. No one who prays to the God of Abraham could strap a suicide vest to an innocent child, or blow up guiltless guests at a Passover Seder, or fly planes into office buildings filled with unsuspecting workers. In truth, the men who carry out these savage acts serve no higher goal than their own desire for power. They accept no God before themselves. And they reserve aspecial hatred for the most ardent defenders of liberty, including Americans and Israelis. And that is why the founding charter of Hamas calls for the ""elimination"" of Israel. And that is why the followers of Hezbollah chant ""Death to Israel, Death to America!"" That is why Osama bin Laden teaches that ""the killing of Jews and Americans is one of the biggest duties."" And that is why the President of Iran dreams of returning the Middle East to the Middle Ages andcalls for Israel to be wiped off the map. There are good and decent people who cannot fathom the darkness in these men and try to explain away their words. It's natural, but it is deadly wrong. As witnesses to evil in the past, we carry a solemn responsibility to take these words seriously. Jews and Americans have seen the consequences of disregarding the words of leaders who espouse hatred. And that is amistake the world must not repeat in the 21st century. Some seem to believe that we should negotiate with the terrorists and radicals, as if some ingenious argument will persuade them they have been wrong all along. We've heard this foolish delusion before. As Nazi tanks crossed into Poland in 1939, an American senator declared: ""Lord, if I could only have talked to Hitler, all this might have been avoided."" We have an obligation to call this what it is: the false comfort of appeasement, which hasbeen repeatedly discredited by history. Some people suggest if the United States w[ould] just break ties with Israel, all our problems in the Middle East would go away. This is a tired argument that buys into the propaganda of the enemies of peace, and America utterly rejects it. Israel's population may be just over seven million. But when you confront terror and evil, you are 307 million strong, because theUnited States of America stands with you. America stands with you in breaking up terrorist networks and denying the extremists sanctuary. America stands with you in firmly opposing Iran's nuclear weapons ambitions. Permitting the world's leading sponsor of terror to possess the world's deadliest weapons would be an unforgivable betrayal for future generations. For the sake of peace, the worldmust not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon. Ultimately, ultimately to prevail in this struggle, we must offer an alternative to the ideology of the extremists by extending our vision of justice and tolerance and freedom and hope. These values are the self-evident right of all people, of all religions, in all the world because they are a gift from the Almighty God. Securing these rights is also the surest way to secure peace. Leaders who are accountable to their people will not pursue endless confrontation and bloodshed. Young people with a place in their society and a voice in their future are less likely to search for meaning in radicalism. Societies where citizens can express their conscience andworship their God will not export violence, they will be partners in peace. The fundamental insight, that freedom yields peace, is the great lesson of the 20th century. Now our task is to apply it to the 21st. Nowhere is this work more urgent than here in the Middle East. We must stand with the reformers working to break the old patterns of tyranny and despair. We must give voice to millions of ordinary people who dream for a better life in a free society. We must confront the moral relativism that views all forms of government as equally acceptable and thereby consigns whole societies to slavery. Above all, we must have faith in our values and ourselves and confidently pursue the expansion of liberty as the pathto a peaceful future. That future will be a dramatic departure from the Middle East of today. So as we mark 60 years from Israel's founding, let us try to envision the region 60 years from now. This vision is not going to arrive easily or overnight; it will encounter violent resistance. But if we and future Presidents and future Knessets maintain our resolve and have faith in our ideals, here's theMiddle East that we can see: Israel will be celebrating the 120th anniversary as one of the world's greatdemocracies, a secure and flourishing homeland for the Jewish people. The Palestinian people will have the homeland they have long dreamed of and deserved -- a democratic state that is governed by law, and respects human rights,and rejects terror. From Cairo to Riyadh to Baghdad and Beirut, people will live in free and independent societies, where a desire for peace is reinforced by ties of diplomacy and tourism andtrade. Iran and Syria will be peaceful nations, with today's oppressive -- oppression a distant memory and where people are free to speak their minds and develop their God-giventalents. Al Qaeda and Hezbollah and Hamas will be defeated, as Muslims across the regionrecognize the emptiness of the terrorists' vision and the injustice of their cause. Overall, the Middle East will be characterized by a new period of tolerance and integration. And this doesn't mean that Israel and its neighbors will be best of friends. But when leaders across the region answer to their people, they will focus theirenergies on schools and jobs, not on rocket attacks and suicide bombings. With this change, Israel will open a new hopeful chapter in which its people can live a normallife, and the dream of Herzl and the founders of 1948 can be fully and finally realized. This is a bold vision, and some will say it can never be achieved. But think about what we have witnessed in our own time. When Europe was destroying itself through total war and genocide, it was difficult to envision a continent that six decades later would be free and at peace. When Japanese pilots were flying suicide missions into American battleships, it seemed impossible that six decades later Japan would be a democracy, a lynchpin of security in Asia, and one of America's closest friends. And when waves of refugees arrived here in the desert with nothing, surrounded by hostile armies, it was almost unimaginable that Israel would growinto one of the freest and most successful nations on the earth. Yet each one of these transformations took place. And a future of transformation is possible in the Middle East, so long as a new generation of leaders has the courage to defeat the enemies of freedom, to make the hard choices necessary for peace, and stand firm on the solid rock ofuniversal values. Sixty years ago, on the eve of Israel's independence, the last British soldiers departing Jerusalem stopped at a building in the Jewish quarter of the Old City. An officer knocked on the door and met a senior rabbi.3 The officer presented him with a short iron bar -- the key to the Zion Gate -- and said it was the first time in 18 centuries that a key to the gates of Jerusalem had belonged to a Jew. His hands trembling, the rabbi offered a prayer of thanksgiving to God, ""Who had granted us life and permitted us to reach this day."" Then he turned to the officer, and uttered the words Jews had awaited for so long: ""I accept this key inthe name of my people."" Over the past six decades, the Jewish people have established a state that would make that humble rabbi proud. You've raised a modern society in the Promised Land, a light unto the nations that preserves the legacy of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. And you have built a mighty democracy that will endure forever and can always count on the United States ofAmerica to be at your side. God bless. 1""Happy Independence Day"" 2""Eretz Yisrael - (Hebrew) Land of Israel; (modern) Jewish homeland to be established in the general area of Palestine. In Ottoman Turkishtimes, Eretz Yisrael and Eretz Hakodesh (the Holy Land) were used to designate the area surrounding Jerusalem and including areas from theLitani river in the north to modern Eilat.

"Klaus, thank you very much. Thanks for inviting me. Klaus said, it's about time you showed up. Proud to be here. Laura and I are so honored that, Klaus, you gave us a chance to come. I do want to thank President Mubarak and Mrs. Mubarak for their wonderful hospitality. I want to thank the members of Congress who are here. I appreciate the heads of state who have joined us. I thank the foreign ministers who are here, including my own, Secretary of StateCondoleezza Rice. And I want to thank the members of the Diplomatic Corps. Laura and I are delighted to be in Egypt, and we bring the warm wishes of the American people. We're proud of our long friendship with your citizens. We respect your remarkable history. And we're humbled to walk in the ancient land of pharaohs, where a great civilizationtook root and wrote some of the first chapters in the epic story of humanity. America is a much younger nation, but we've made our mark by advancing ideals as old as the pyramids. Those ideals of liberty and justice have sparked a revolution across much of the world. This hopeful movement made its way to places where dictators once reigned and peaceful democracies seemed unimaginable: places like Chile and Indonesia and Poland and the Philippines and South Korea. These nations have different histories and different traditions. Yet each made the same democratic transition, and they did it on their own terms. In these countries, millions every year are rising from poverty. Women are realizing overdueopportunities. And people of faith are finding the blessing of worshiping God in peace. All these changes took place in the second half of the 20th century. I strongly believe that if leaders like those of you in this room act with vision and resolve, the first half of 21st century can be the time when similar advances reach the Middle East. This region is home to energetic people, a powerful spirit of enterprise, and tremendous resources. It is capable of a very bright future -- a future in which the Middle East is a place of innovation and discovery, drivenby free men and women. In recent years, we've seen hopeful beginnings toward this vision. Turkey, a nation with a majority Muslim population, is a prosperous modern democracy. Afghanistan under the leadership of President Karzai is overcoming the Taliban and building a free society. Iraq under the leadership of Prime Minister Maliki is establishing a multi-ethnic democracy. We have seen the stirrings of reform from Morocco and Algeria to Jordan and the Gulf States. And isolation from the outside world is being overcome by the most democratic of innovations: the cell phone and the Internet. America appreciates the challenges facing the Middle East. Yetthe light of liberty is beginning to shine. There is much to do to build on this momentum. From diversifying your economies, to investing in your people, to extending the reach of freedom, nations across the region have an opportunity to move forward with bold and confident reforms -- and lead the Middle East to itsrightful place as a center of progress and achievement. Taking your place as a center of progress and achievement requires economic reform. This is a time of strength for many of your nations' economies. Since 2004, economic growth in the region has averaged more than 5 percent. Trade has expanded significantly. Technology has advanced rapidly. Foreign investment has increased dramatically. And unemployment rates have decreased in many nations. Egypt, for example, has posted strong economic growth, developed some of the world's fastest growing telecommunications companies, and made major investments that will boost tourism and trade. In order for this economic progress to result in permanent prosperity and an Egypt that reaches its full potential, however, economic reform must be accompanied by political reform. And I continue to hope that Egypt can leadthe region in political reform. This is also a time to prepare for the economic changes ahead. Rising price of oil has brought great wealth to some in this region, but the supply of oil is limited, and nations like mine are aggressively developing alternatives to oil. Over time, as the world becomes less dependent on oil, nations in the Middle East will have to build more diverse and more dynamiceconomies. Your greatest asset in this quest is the entrepreneurial spirit of your people. The best way to take advantage of that spirit is to make reforms that unleash individual creativity and innovation. Your economies will be more vibrant when citizens who dream of starting their own companies can do so quickly, without high regulatory and registration costs. Your economies will be more dynamic when property rights are protected and risk-taking is encouraged -- not punished -- by law. Your economies will be more resilient when you adopt modern agricultural techniques that make farmers more productive and the food supply more secure. And your economies will have greater long-term prosperity when taxes are low and allyour citizens know that their innovation and hard work will be rewarded. One of the most powerful drivers of economic growth is free trade. So nations in this region would benefit greatly from breaking down barriers to trade with each other. And America will continue working to open up trade at every level. In recent years, the United States has completed free trade agreements with Jordan, Oman, Morocco, and Bahrain. America will continue to negotiate bilateral free trade agreements in the region. We strongly supported Saudi Arabia's accession to the World Trade Organization, and we will continue to support nations making the reforms necessary to join the institutions of a global economy. To break down trade barriers and ignite economic growth around the world, we will worktirelessly for a successful outcome to the Doha Round this year. As we seek to open new markets abroad, America will keep our markets open at home. There are voices in my country that urge America to adopt measures that would isolate us from the global economy. I firmly reject these calls for protectionism. We will continue to welcomeforeign investment and trade. And the United States of America will stay open for business. Taking your place as a center of progress and achievement requires investing in your people. Some analysts believe the Middle East and North Africa will need to create up to 100 million new jobs over the next 10 to 15 years just to keep up with population growth. The key torealizing this goal is an educated workforce. This starts early on, with primary schools that teach basic skills, such as reading and math, rather than indoctrinating children with ideologies of hatred. An educated workforce also requires good high schools and universities, where students are exposed to a variety of ideas, learn to think for themselves, and develop the capacity to innovate. Not long ago the region marked a hopeful milestone in higher education. In our meeting yesterday, President Karzai told me he recently handed out diplomas to university graduates, including 300 degrees in medicine, and a hundred degrees in engineering, and a lot of degrees to lawyers, and many ofthe recipients were women. People of the Middle East can count on the United States to be a strong partner in improving your educational systems. We are sponsoring training programs for teachers and administrators in nations like Jordan and Morocco and Lebanon. We sponsored English language programs where students can go for intensive language instruction. We have translated more than 80 children's books into Arabic. And we have developed new onlinecurricula for students from kindergarten through high school. It is also in America's interest to continue welcoming aspiring young adults from this region for higher education to the United States. There were understandable concerns about student visas after 9/11. My administration has worked hard to improve the visa process. And I'm pleased to report that we are issuing a growing numbers of student visas to young people from the Middle East. And that's the way it should be. And we'll continue to work to expand educational exchanges, because we benefit from the contribution of foreign students who study in America because we're proud to train the world's leaders of tomorrow and because we know there is no better antidote to the propaganda ofour enemies than firsthand experience with life in the United States of America. Building powerful economies also requires expanding the role of women in society. This is a matter of morality and of basic math. No nation that cuts off half its population from opportunities will be as productive or prosperous as it could be. Women are a formidable force, as I have seen in my own family and my own administration. As the nations of theMiddle East open up their laws and their societies to women, they are learning the same thing. I applaud Egypt. Egypt is a model for the development of professional women. In Afghanistan, girls who were once denied even a basic education are now going to school, and a whole generation of Afghans will grow up with the intellectual tools to lead their nation toward prosperity. In Iraq and Kuwait, women are joining political parties and running campaigns and serving in public office. In some Gulf States, women entrepreneurs are making a living and aname for themselves in the business world. Recently, I learned of a woman in Bahrain who owns her own shipping company. She started with a small office and two employees. When she first tried to register her business in her own name, she was turned down. She attended a business training class and was the only woman to participate. And when she applied for a customs license, officials expressed surprisebecause no woman had ever asked for one before. And yet with hard work and determination, she turned her small company into a $2 million enterprise. And this year, Huda Janahi was named one of the 50 most powerful businesswomen in the Arab world. Huda is an inspiring example for the whole region. And America's message to other women in the Middle East is this: You have a great deal to contribute, you should have a strong voice in leading your countries, and my nation looks tothe day when you have the rights and privileges you deserve. Taking your place as a center of progress and achievement requires extending the reach of freedom. Expanding freedom is vital to turning temporary wealth into lasting prosperity. Free societies stimulate competition in the marketplace. Free societies give people access to information they need to make informed and responsible decisions. And free societies give citizens the rule of law, which exposes corruption and buildsconfidence in the future. Freedom is also the basis for a democratic system of government, which is the only fair and just ordering of society and the only way to guarantee the God-given rights of all people. Democracies do not take the same shape; they develop at different speeds and in different ways, and they reflect the unique cultures and traditions of their people. There are skeptics about democracy in this part of the world, I understand that. But as more people in the Middle East gain firsthand experience from freedom, many of the arguments against democracy arebeing discredited. For example, some say that democracy is a Western value that America seeks to impose on unwilling citizens. This is a condescending form of moral relativism. The truth is that freedom is a universal right -- the Almighty's gift to every man, woman, and child on the face of Earth. And as we've seen time and time again, when people are allowed to make a choice between freedom and the alternative, they choose freedom. In Afghanistan, 8 million people defied the terrorist threats to vote for a democratic President. In Iraq, 12 million people waved ink- stained fingers to celebrate the first democratic election in decades. And in a recent survey of the Muslim world, there was overwhelming support for one of the central tenets of democracy,freedom of speech: 99 percent in Lebanon, 94 percent here in Egypt, and 92 percent in Iran. There are people who claim that democracy is incompatible with Islam. But the truth is that democracies, by definition, make a place for people of religious belief. America is one of the most -- is one of the world's leading democracies, and we're also one of the most religious nations in the world. More than three-quarters of our citizens believe in a higher power. Millions worship every week and pray every day. And they do so without fear of reprisal from the state. In our democracy, we would never punish a person for owning a Koran. We would never issue a death sentence to someone for converting to Islam. Democracy does not threaten Islam or any religion. Democracy is the only system of government that guaranteestheir protection. Some say any state that holds an election is a democracy. But true democracy requires vigorous political parties allowed to engage in free and lively debate. True democracy requires the establishment of civic institutions that ensure an election's legitimacy and hold leaders accountable. And true democracy requires competitive elections in which oppositioncandidates are allowed to campaign without fear or intimidation. Too often in the Middle East, politics has consisted of one leader in power and the opposition in jail. America is deeply concerned about the plight of political prisoners in this region, as well as democratic activists who are intimidated or repressed, newspapers and civil society organizations that are shut down, and dissidents whose voices are stifled. The time has come for nations across the Middle East to abandon these practices, and treat their people with dignity and the respect they deserve. I call on all nations to release their prisoners ofconscience, open up their political debate, and trust their people to chart their future. The vision I have outlined today is shared by many in this region -- but unfortunately, there are some spoilers who stand in the way. Terrorist organizations and their state sponsors know they cannot survive in a free society, so they create chaos and take innocent lives in an effort to stop democracy from taking root. They are on the wrong side in a great ideological struggle -- and every nation committed to freedom and progress in the Middle East must standtogether to defeat them. We must stand with the Palestinian people, who have suffered for decades and earned the right to be a homeland of their own -- have a homeland of their own. I strongly support a two-state solution -- a democratic Palestine based on law and justice that will live with peace and security alongside a democrat Israel. I believe that the Palestinian people will build a thriving democracy in which entrepreneurs pursue their dreams, and families own their homesin lively communities, and young people grow up with hope in the future. Last year at Annapolis, we made a hopeful beginning toward a peace negotiation that will outline what this nation of Palestine will look like -- a contiguous state where Palestinians live in prosperity and dignity. A peace agreement is in the Palestinians' interests, it is in Israel's interests, it is in Arab states' interests, and it is in the world's interests. And I firmly believethat with leadership and courage, we can reach that peace agreement this year. This is a demanding task. It requires action on all sides. Palestinians must fight terror and continue to build the institutions of a free and peaceful society. Israel must make tough sacrifices for peace and ease the restrictions on the Palestinians. Arab states, especially oil- rich nations, must seize this opportunity to invest aggressively in the Palestinian people and to move past their old resentments against Israel. And all nations in the region must stand together in confronting Hamas, which is attempting to undermine efforts at peace with acts ofterror and violence. We must stand with the people of Lebanon in their struggle to build a sovereign and independent democracy. This means opposing Hezbollah terrorists, funded by Iran, who recently revealed their true intentions by taking up arms against the Lebanese people. It is now clearer than ever that Hezbollah militias are the enemy of a free Lebanon -- and all nations, especially neighbors in the region, have an interest to help the Lebanese peopleprevail. We must stand with the people of Iraq and Afghanistan and other nations in the region fighting against al Qaeda and other extremists. Bin Laden and his followers have made clear that anyone who does not share their extremist ideology is fit for murder. That means every government in the Middle East is a target of al Qaeda. And America is a target too. Andtogether, we will confront and we will defeat this threat to civilization. We must stand with the good and decent people of Iran and Syria, who deserve so much better than the life they have today. Every peaceful nation in the region has an interest in stopping these nations from supporting terrorism. And every peaceful nation in the region has an interest in opposing Iran's nuclear weapons ambitions. To allow the world's leading sponsor of terror to gain the world's deadliest weapon would be an unforgivable betrayal of futuregenerations. For the sake of peace, the world must not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon. The changes I have discussed today will not come easily -- change never does. But the reform movement in the Middle East has a powerful engine: demographics. Sixty percent of the population is under 30 years old. Many of these young people surf the web, own cell phones, have satellite televisions. They have access to unprecedented amounts of information. They see what freedom has brought to millions of others and contrast that to what they have athome. Today, I have a message for these young people: Some tell -- some will tell you change is impossible, but history has a way of surprising us, and change can happen more quickly than we expect. In the past century, one concept has transcended borders, cultures, and languages. In Arabic, ""hurriyya"" -- in English, ""freedom."" Across the world, the call forfreedom lives in our hearts, endures in our prayers, and joins humanity as one. I know these are trying times, but the future is in your hands -- and freedom and peace are within your grasp. Just imagine what this region could look like in 60 years. The Palestinian people will have the homeland they have long dreamed of and deserve -- a democratic state that is governed by law, respects human rights, and rejects terror. Israel will be celebrating its 120 anniversary as one of the world's great democracies -- a secure and flourishinghomeland for the Jewish people. From Cairo, Riyadh, Baghdad to Beirut, people will live in free and independent societies, where a desire for peace is reinforced by ties of diplomacy and tourism and trade. Iran and Syria will be peaceful nations, where today's oppression is a distant memory and people are free to speak their minds and develop their talents. Al Qaeda, Hezbollah, and Hamas will be defeated, as Muslims across the region recognize the emptiness of the terrorists' vision andthe injustice of their cause. This vision is the same one I outlined in my address to the Israeli Knesset. Yet it's not a Jewish vision or a Muslim vision, not an American vision or an Arab vision. It is a universal vision, based on the timeless principles of dignity and tolerance and justice -- and it unites allwho yearn for freedom and peace in this ancient land. Realizing this vision will not be easy. It will take time, and sacrifice, and resolve. Yet there is no doubt in my mind that you are up to the challenge -- and with your ingenuity and your enterprise and your courage, this historic vision for the Middle East will be realized. May Godbe with you on the journey, and the United States of America always will be at your side. Thank you for having me.",bush
"Good evening. This is an extraordinary period for America's economy. Over the past few weeks, many Americans have felt anxiety about their finances and their future. I understand their worry and their frustration. We've seen triple-digit swings in the stock market. Major financial institutions have teetered on the edge of collapse, and some have failed. As uncertainty has grown, many banks have restricted lending. Credit markets have frozen. Andfamilies and businesses have found it harder to borrow money. We're in the midst of a serious financial crisis, and the federal government is responding with decisive action. We've boosted confidence in money market mutual funds, and acted toprevent major investors from intentionally driving down stocks for their own personal gain. Most importantly, my administration is working with Congress to address the root cause behind much of the instability in our markets. Financial assets related to home mortgages have lost value during the housing decline. And the banks holding these assets have restricted credit. As a result, our entire economy is in danger. So I've proposed that the federal government reduce the risk posed by these troubled assets, and supply urgently-neededmoney so banks and other financial institutions can avoid collapse and resume lending. This rescue effort is not aimed at preserving any individual company or industry -- it is aimed at preserving America's overall economy. It will help American consumers and businesses get credit to meet their daily needs and create jobs. And it will help send a signal to marketsaround the world that America's financial system is back on track. I know many Americans have questions tonight: How did we reach this point in our economy? How will the solution I've proposed work? And what does this mean for your financial future?These are good questions, and they deserve clear answers. First, how did our economy reach this point? Well, most economists agree that the problems we are witnessing today developed over a long period of time. For more than a decade, a massive amount of money flowed into the United States from investors abroad, because our country is an attractive and secure place to do business. This large influx of money to U.S. banks and financial institutions -- along with low interest rates -- made it easier for Americans to get credit. These developments allowed more families to borrow money for cars and homes and college tuition -- some for the firsttime. They allowed more entrepreneurs to get loans to start new businesses and create jobs. Unfortunately, there were also some serious negative consequences, particularly in the housing market. Easy credit -- combined with the faulty assumption that home values would continue to rise -- led to excesses and bad decisions. Many mortgage lenders approved loans for borrowers without carefully examining their ability to pay. Many borrowers took out loans larger than they could afford, assuming that they could sell or refinance their homes at ahigher price later on. Optimism about housing values also led to a boom in home construction. Eventually the number of new houses exceeded the number of people willing to buy them. And with supply exceeding demand, housing prices fell. And this created a problem: Borrowers with adjustable rate mortgages who had been planning to sell or refinance their homes at a higher price were stuck with homes worth less than expected -- along with mortgage payments they could notafford. As a result, many mortgage holders began to default. These widespread defaults had effects far beyond the housing market. See, in today's mortgage industry, home loans are often packaged together, and converted into financial products called ""mortgage-backed securities."" These securities were sold to investors around the world. Many investors assumed these securities were trustworthy, and asked few questions about their actual value. Two of the leading purchasers of mortgage-backed securities were Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Because these companies were chartered by Congress, many believed they were guaranteed by the federal government. This allowed them to borrow enormous sums of money, fuel the market for questionable investments, and putour financial system at risk. The decline in the housing market set off a domino effect across our economy. When home values declined, borrowers defaulted on their mortgages, and investors holding mortgage- backed securities began to incur serious losses. Before long, these securities became so unreliable that they were not being bought or sold. Investment banks such as Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers found themselves saddled with large amounts of assets they could not sell. They ran out of the money needed to meet their immediate obligations. And they faced imminent collapse. Other banks found themselves in severe financial trouble. These banks began holding on to their money, and lending dried up, and the gears of the Americanfinancial system began grinding to a halt. With the situation becoming more precarious by the day, I faced a choice: To step in with dramatic government action, or to stand back and allow the irresponsible actions of some toundermine the financial security of all. I'm a strong believer in free enterprise. So my natural instinct is to oppose government intervention. I believe companies that make bad decisions should be allowed to go out of business. Under normal circumstances, I would have followed this course. But these are not normal circumstances. The market is not functioning properly. There's been a widespread loss of confidence. And major sectors of America's financial system are at risk ofshutting down. The government's top economic experts warn that without immediate action by Congress,America could slip into a financial panic, and a distressing scenario would unfold: More banks could fail, including some in your community. The stock market would drop even more, which would reduce the value of your retirement account. The value of your home could plummet. Foreclosures would rise dramatically. And if you own a business or a farm, you would find it harder and more expensive to get credit. More businesses would close their doors, and millions of Americans could lose their jobs. Even if you have good credit history, it would be more difficult for you to get the loans you need to buy a car or send your children tocollege. And ultimately, our country could experience a long and painful recession. Fellow citizens: We must not let this happen. I appreciate the work of leaders from both parties in both houses of Congress to address this problem -- and to make improvements to the proposal my administration sent to them. There is a spirit of cooperation between Democrats and Republicans, and between Congress and this administration. In that spirit, I've invited Senators McCain and Obama to join congressional leaders of both parties at the WhiteHouse tomorrow to help speed our discussions toward a bipartisan bill. I know that an economic rescue package will present a tough vote for many members of Congress. It is difficult to pass a bill that commits so much of the taxpayers' hard-earned money. I also understand the frustration of responsible Americans who pay their mortgages on time, file their tax returns every April 15th, and are reluctant to pay the cost of excesses on Wall Street. But given the situation we are facing, not passing a bill now would cost theseAmericans much more later. Many Americans are asking: How would a rescue plan work? After much discussion, there is now widespread agreement on the principles such a plan would include. It would remove the risk posed by the troubled assets -- including mortgage- backed securities -- now clogging the financial system. This would free banks to resume the flow of credit to American families and businesses. Any rescue plan should also be designed to ensure that taxpayers are protected. It should welcome the participation of financial institutions large and small. It should make certain that failed executives do not receive a windfall from your tax dollars. It should establish a bipartisan board to oversee the plan's implementation. And it should be enacted as soon aspossible. In close consultation with Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, and SEC Chairman Chris Cox, I announced a plan on Friday. First, the plan is big enough to solve a serious problem. Under our proposal, the federal government would put up to $700 billion taxpayer dollars on the line to purchase troubled assets that are clogging the financial system. In the short term, this will free up banks to resume the flow of credit toAmerican families and businesses. And this will help our economy grow. Second, as markets have lost confidence in mortgage-backed securities, their prices have dropped sharply. Yet the value of many of these assets will likely be higher than their current price, because the vast majority of Americans will ultimately pay off their mortgages. The government is the one institution with the patience and resources to buy these assets at their current low prices and hold them until markets return to normal. And when that happens, money will flow back to the Treasury as these assets are sold. And we expect that much, ifnot all, of the tax dollars we invest will be paid back. A final question is: What does this mean for your economic future? The primary steps -- purpose of the steps I have outlined tonight is to safeguard the financial security of American workers and families and small businesses. The federal government also continues to enforce laws and regulations protecting your money. The Treasury Department recently offered government insurance for money market mutual funds. And through the FDIC, every savings account, checking account, and certificate of deposit is insured by the federal government for up to $100,000. The FDIC has been in existence for 75 years, and noone has ever lost a penny on an insured deposit -- and this will not change. Once this crisis is resolved, there will be time to update our financial regulatory structures. Our 21st century global economy remains regulated largely by outdated 20th century laws. Recently, we've seen how one company can grow so large that its failure jeopardizes theentire financial system. Earlier this year, Secretary Paulson proposed a blueprint that would modernize our financial regulations. For example, the Federal Reserve would be authorized to take a closer look at the operations of companies across the financial spectrum and ensure that their practices do not threaten overall financial stability. There are other good ideas, and members of Congress should consider them. As they do, they must ensure that efforts to regulate Wall Street do notend up hampering our economy's ability to grow. In the long run, Americans have good reason to be confident in our economic strength. Despite corrections in the marketplace and instances of abuse, democratic capitalism is the best system ever devised. It has unleashed the talents and the productivity, and entrepreneurial spirit of our citizens. It has made this country the best place in the world to invest and do business. And it gives our economy the flexibility and resilience to absorbshocks, adjust, and bounce back. Our economy is facing a moment of great challenge. But we've overcome tough challenges before -- and we will overcome this one. I know that Americans sometimes get discouraged by the tone in Washington, and the seemingly endless partisan struggles. Yet history has shown that in times of real trial, elected officials rise to the occasion. And together, we will show the world once again what kind of country America is -- a nation that tackles problems head on, where leaders come together to meet great tests, and where people of everybackground can work hard, develop their talents, and realize their dreams. Thank you for listening. May God bless you.",bush
"Thank you. Welcome. Good morning. This is a special day for the White House. Laura and I are proud to welcome the greatest Olympic and Paralympic team ever assembled. And I bring greetings from the honorarycaptain of the Olympic teams -- President George H. W. Bush. We call him 41. I want to thank the members of the Cabinet who are here, and the administration. I want to thank the coaches and the team leaders, and the U.S. Olympic Committee leadership and staff for being here. We welcome the representatives of Chicago 2016 who are here. Members of the U.S. Armed Forces, moms, dads, girlfriends, boyfriends, supporters of the mighty Olympicteam, we're glad you're here. I do want to welcome members of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, including John Burke, the Chairman; Dot Richardson, the Vice Chairman -- by the way, member of the 1996 and 2000 U.S. Olympic gold medal softball teams. And the reason I want to mention them is today the Health and Human Services is issuing its Physical Fitness Guidelines, and there's no better time to remind our fellow citizens that physical fitness will lead to a healthy America. Just look what's happened to the people surrounding me. And so we urge our fellow citizens to look at these guidelines and to take time out of your day to exercise. Now, not every one of you has to ride a mountain bike. But ifyou walk just 20 minutes a day you'll help America and help yourself. Attending the Beijing Olympics was one of the great experiences of our lifetime. Laura and I had a fantastic experience. We will never forget the first night at the Bird's Nest for the spectacular Opening Ceremony. When the Team USA was announced, there was a notable increase in the cheers. And then came the greatest sight of all -- more than 500 America's --of America's finest athletes marching behind our flag, carried by Bernard Lagat.1 It was an incredible sight, and I know it was a moment that all of our athletes looked forward to and it'sa moment that we were so honored to share with you. In the weeks that followed, our Olympic team took part in the largest games ever held. Over 100,000 [sic]2 athletes competed in more than 300 events. An unprecedented 87 countries brought home medals. Forty-three world records were broken. About 4.7 billion viewerswatched the Olympics. And with the eyes of the world turned on Beijing, our teams rose to the occasion. The Olympicteam finished with the top medal count of 110 medals. But more impressive was the decency and character that these Olympics brought on the world stage. I know you worked hard -- the Olympics and Paralympic teams worked hard to get to this moment. Whether you won a medal or not, it really doesn't matter in the long run. What really matters is the honor you brought to your sports and to your families and to yourcountry. And we thank you for the lasting memories that you gave us all. And so here are some of the lasting memories that I will take with me forever. First of all, the Water Cube -- watching Jason Lezak touch out I think it was the French team -- on the 4x100 freestyle relay, and thenwatching the joy of his teammates, including Michael Phelps. People say, did you ever get to meet Michael Phelps? I said I did. So that was the highlight? I said, not really; meeting his mother was more of a highlight. She reminded me of my mother-- plainspoken and full of love. So, Michael, we congratulate you. We thank you for joining us today. And we congratulate allthe swimmers for the Olympic team. And how about our gymnasts? Nastia Liukin and Shawn Johnson. What I found interesting was that these champions were roommates while they were competing for gold. And one wonders whether or not that friendship would be damaged in the heat of the competition. The truth of the matter is, it wasn't. They showed the true Olympic spirit of being competitors in the gym, but being friends in the dorm. And so we welcome these two champions here today, and wethank you for setting such a good example. So, as you know, I'm a baseball guy, and have come to admire women's softball a lot. Yes. So I know with us today are Finch, Duran, Abbot, Galindo, Lappin, Lowe, Berg and Watley --members of the U.S. Olympic women's softball team. I bring this up because I really think that these women are an inspiration to young girls all across the globe, and the Olympics would be smart to keep women's softball as a part of itsprogram. And I want to thank you for welcoming [me] to your practice. I also want to welcome today a fellow Texan named Laura Wilkinson. At Sydney she stunned the world by taking gold. This summer, she returned to the Olympic stage for the third and final time, and she was fighting through injuries. But she brought such class to the arena. There was never any of this, ""Woe is me; how pitiful is life."" She said she was honored to compete. She and her husband have returned home to the great state of Texas to raise money for a new diving center in The Woodlands, Texas. In other words, she had put something back into the community. And I urge all of us -- whether we're Olympic -- Olympians or not to recognize the opportunity to make the communities in which we live abetter place. Laura, welcome and thank you for the example you have set. So I spent a little time at the beach volleyball arena. I got to meet Todd Rogers and Phil Dalhausser. These two men are incredible athletes and they -- it was really interesting to be there to watch them warm up. And then they introduced me to the Brazilian team and to the Italian team, and it was really a lot of fun -- but not nearly as much fun as spending time withMisty May-Treaner and Kerri Walsh. These two women are not only great athletes, they're really great people. And I'm just so sorry that Misty May got injured on Dancing [with] the Stars. God, if only she had me as a partner, you know? Except I can't dance. But I wish -- you know, it's interesting, I read a comment from Misty May today. She said, yes, I got hurt Dancing on [sic] the Stars, but I'llbe back at the 2012 Olympics. I also know that all of us were deeply touched by what happened to Hugh McCutcheon and his family. Nevertheless, we were greatly inspired when the men's volleyball team rallied. They won an incredible gold medal against all odds to really help lift up the coach's family and hisspirits, as well as the whole nation's spirits. I congratulate the men and women's basketball teams. You can just imagine what it was like when the men's basketball team asked me to get in one of their huddles right before the game against China. I was like a jockey. But they brought a lot of class to the courts, both teams did. What impressed me and Laura was that the men were there cheering on the women, and the women were there cheering on the men. There was ample opportunity for people to ""big shot"" it at the Olympics. Not our athletes. They were there for the right reason,to support their teams and to support their nations, our nation. Now, one of the things that we really regret missing was the -- being in the Bird's Nest for the 13th Paralympic Games. And we congratulate the athletes who are here, as well. Werecognize your hard work, and we're proud to call you Olympians. I'm particularly pleased to be here with those who have worn the uniform of our country. On the America team were 16 men and women who served the nation in uniform -- one of whom was Army Lieutenant Melissa Stockwell. She lost her leg while serving our country in Iraq. Four years after hard work, four years after significant rehabilitation, she qualified as aswimmer. And her teammates elected her as the flag bearer for the Closing Ceremonies. We welcome you, Melissa, and we welcome you all. Long after we leave the White House, Laura and I will remember the extraordinary spirit and kindness of the athletes that we have met here at the White House and in Beijing. One unforgettable moment came after swimmer Larsen Jensen won the bronze medal in the 400 freestyle relay. When he was presented his bouquet of flowers, he looked around the Water Cube and he made a special delivery: He climbed into the stands and he gave the bouquet to Laura. It was an incredibly kind gesture -- and by the way, Larsen, our anniversary is next month if you'd like to go. He also told me something in private, where he said he looksforward to serving our country. Our Olympic athletes have served our country in many ways. But you have a chance to continue to serve. And we honor your service as athletes, and we look forward to honoringyour service as worthy citizens of our great country. You amazed the world with your talent and grace and sportsmanship. You inspired children tochase their dreams. You will be champions forever. May God bless you, and may God bless America. 1 Lopez Lamong was the flag bearer for the U.S. during the Opening Ceremonies of the 2008 Summer Olympic Games. Bernard Lagatparticipated in the 1500m (semifinals) and 5000m distance races in those Olympics. 2 11,028 athletes competed in the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China",bush
"Mr. Director, thank you for your kind introduction and thank you for your leadership. Proud that you invited your wife, Ann, here to be with us. I thank the Attorney General for joining us today. Members of the FBI Academy staff, distinguished guests, family and friends, and mostimportantly, members of the graduating class: Thanks for having me. I am so pleased to be back to the FBI Academy, and to share with you this special day. When you walk across the stage, you will receive your badge and your credentials. You'll become special agents of the FBI. You will take your place on the front lines on the war on terror. I thank you for stepping forward to serve your country during this important time. And onbehalf of all Americans, I congratulate the Class of 08-14. This academy has prepared you for the privileges and responsibilities of carrying the badge. Over the past 20 weeks, you have passed rigorous academic and physical requirements. You have spent hours practicing your aim on the firing range, combing the streets of Hogan's Alley, and navigating the Academy's ""gerbil tubes."" As part of your training, you were all forced to endure the sting of pepper spray -- which you learned wasn't half as bad as thecafeteria food. To reach this day of accomplishment, you have all depended on the wisdom and advice of your instructors. They took a diverse group that includes combat veterans, police officers, firefighters, lawyers, language experts, and computer specialists. And they turned you into an impressive class of FBI special agents. Your instructors are proud of your accomplishments --and I know you are grateful for their leadership. To reach this day of accomplishment, you depended on the support of your loved ones. While you were away training for this academy, some of them were really sweating out the training for you. And Rick mentioned a lot of you were packing bags. I'm thankful you didn't mentionCrawford, Texas. And so are you. But the point is, America owes your families a great debt. And we thank you for standing by your side -- thank them for standing by your side during this moment of training and theservice you'll be rendering to our country. We welcome the families here today. Members of this class join the FBI during a momentous time in our nation's history. Earlier this summer the FBI celebrated its 100th anniversary. Unfortunately I wasn't able to attend the official ceremony. So I asked the Attorney General to speak in my place. To be honest, I was somewhat concerned that he might not live up to my high standards of oratory. He toldme I had nothing to worry about. The Bureau has come a long way since its founding. Over the past century, the FBI has grown from a small team of 34 investigators to a powerful force of more than 30,000 agents and analysts and support professionals serving around the world. The FBI has pushed the boundaries of forensic science -- from mastering the art of fingerprints to pioneering the use of DNA evidence. The FBI has inspired generations of children to dream of joining the force. Sounds like I inspired one or two myself. In every era, the FBI has risen to meet new challenges. When mobsters brought crime and chaos to America's cities during the 1920s and '30s, the G-Men of the FBI brought them to justice. When America entered the Second World War, the FBI stopped Axis agents from carrying out attacks on our homeland. During the Cold War, the FBI worked long hours to protect America from Soviet spies. In all this work, the FBI has gained an incredible record of achievement and has earned the admiration of the entire world. America honors all the finemen and women who have served in the ranks before you. As you go forth from this Academy, you're going to write a new chapter in the FBI's storied history. In the years ahead, your assignments will be as diverse as the FBI's mission -- from dismantling organized criminal networks, to pulling the plug on online predators, to making white-collar criminals pay for defrauding hardworking Americans. And just as your predecessors adapted to meet the challenges of the past century, there's no doubt in my mindyou'll respond with courage to confront the emerging dangers of this new century. Those dangers became clear on September the 11th, 2001. On that day, 19 terrorists brought death and destruction to our shores. We became a nation at war against violent extremists.And we must not rest until that war is won. More than seven years have passed without another attack on our soil. And this is not an accident. Since 9/11, we have gone on the offense against the terrorists abroad -- so we do not have to face them here at home. We stand with young democracies in Afghanistan and Iraq and beyond as they seek to replace the hateful ideology of the extremists with a hopefulalternative of liberty. Here at home, we've transformed our national security institutions and have given our intelligence and law enforcement professionals the tools and the resources they need to do their job, and that is to protect the American people. We formed a new Department of Homeland Security. We created a new Director for National Intelligence. We established a program at the Central Intelligence Agency to interrogate key terrorist leaders captured in the war on terror. We worked with Congress to pass legislation that allows our intelligence professionals to quickly and effectively monitor terrorist communications while protecting the civil liberties of our citizens. If al Qaeda is making a phone call into the United States, we needto know why and to whom they're calling in order to protect the American citizens. The FBI has played a vital role in doing the most important job that government has, and that is to secure the American people from harm. Since 9/11, the Bureau has worked with our partners around the world to disrupt planned terrorist attacks. Most Americans will never know the full stories of how these attacks were stopped and how many lives were saved. But we know this: The men and women of the FBI are working tirelessly to keep our nation safe --and they have the thanks of the American people. The FBI's leadership in the war on terror has required a dramatic change of mission. Before 9/11, terrorism was viewed primarily as a criminal matter. The FBI focused more on indicting terrorists after an attack than on stopping the attack in the first place. For example, after the terrorists targeted the World Trade Center in 1993, FBI agents succeeded in tracking down several of the killers. They obtained indictments against them and they put them behind bars.And that was good work. But eight years later al Qaeda returned to finish the job. Immediately after 9/11, the FBI made preventing terrorism its top priority. The FBI you join today is focused on collecting and analyzing intelligence -- so we can figure out what the terrorists are planning before it is too late. Over the past seven years, we have more than doubled the number of intelligence analysts and translators on the force. We've enacted the Patriot Act to ensure FBI analysts and investigators have the information they need to protect our nation. We created the FBI's new National Security Branch -- bringing together divisionsresponsible for counterterrorism and intelligence and counterespionage. The FBI you join today is working more closely with partners at all levels of government. At the local level, we've increased the number of FBI Joint Terrorism Task Forces from 35 to more than 100. These task forces bring together federal and local law enforcement agents. They have helped break up terror cells in places like Portland, Oregon; Buffalo, New York; andnorthern Virginia. At the national level, we created the National Counterterrorism Center, where the FBI is working side by side with the CIA, the Homeland Security Department, and other federal agencies to track terrorist threats and prevent new attacks. We created the TerrorismScreening Center to consolidate watch lists from different agencies into one master list. At the international level, we've deployed the FBI to foreign countries to help track down the terrorists. Since September the 11th, the FBI has opened 16 new offices overseas. Two of them are in Kabul and Baghdad -- where hundreds of FBI agents are serving alongside ourbrave men and women in uniform. The FBI can be proud of all these accomplishments. These changes were difficult, and they were necessary. We've transformed an agency founded a century ago to meet the challenges of the 21st century. And thanks to the vision and determination of the FBI, America is safertoday than we were on September the 11th, 2001. In the midst of this rapid change, we can be confident that one thing will never change -- and that is the character and courage of those who carry the badge. We see this character and courage in the story of an agent named Leonard Hatton. A bomb specialist for the FBI, Lenny had investigated terrorist attacks around the world. So when he saw smoke rising from the World Trade Center on September the 11th, 2001, he immediately understood the danger. With complete disregard for his own life, he ran to the scene to help others escape. And when the towers came crashing down, Lenny died beneath them. Earlier that same morning, Lenny had told his wife, ""Just another regular day at work."" Well, for a man like Lenny Hatton -- who always put others before himself -- it was another day at work. We must always honor the memory of this good and faithful servant -- and we vow that those who have given their livesin the war on terror shall never have died in vain. As new special agents, your charge to keep is to carry out this mission. I ask you to defend the values of fidelity, bravery, and integrity that you have learned here at this Academy. I ask you to carry out your duty to protect the lives and liberties of the American people. If you follow these principles, your careers will take you far, this agency will uphold its solemnresponsibility, and America's security will be in good hands. I want to thank you for sharing your graduation with me. I'm inspired by your examples of service. I wish you all the best in the future. May God bless you.",bush
"Good morning. Last night, I had a warm conversation with President-elect Barack Obama. I congratulated him and Senator Biden on their impressive victory. I told the President-elect he can count on complete cooperation from my Administration as he makes the transition to theWhite House. I also spoke to Senator John McCain. I congratulated him on a determined campaign that he and Governor Palin ran. The American people will always be grateful for the lifetime of service John McCain has devoted to this nation. And I know he'll continue to make tremendouscontributions to our country. No matter how they cast their ballots, all Americans can be proud of the history that was made yesterday. Across the country, citizens voted in large numbers. They showed a watching world the vitality of America's democracy, and the strides we have made toward a more perfect union. They chose a President whose journey represents a triumph of the Americanstory -- a testament to hard work, optimism, and faith in the enduring promise of our nation. Many of our citizens thought they would never live to see that day. This moment is especially uplifting for a generation of Americans who witnessed the struggle for civil rights with theirown eyes -- and four decades later see a dream fulfilled. A long campaign has now ended, and we move forward as one nation. We're embarking on a period of change in Washington, yet there are some things that will not change. The United States government will stay vigilant in meeting its most important responsibility -- protecting the American people. And the world can be certain this commitment will remain steadfastunder our next Commander-in-Chief. There's important work to do in the months ahead, and I will continue to conduct the people's business as long as this Office remains in my trust. During this time of transition, I will keep the President-elect fully informed on important decisions. And when the time comes on January the 20th, Laura and I will return home to Texas with treasured memories of our timehere -- and with profound gratitude for the honor of serving this amazing country. It will be a stirring sight to watch President Obama, his wife, Michelle, and their beautiful girls step through the doors of the White House. I know millions of Americans will be overcome with pride at this inspiring moment that so many have awaited so long. I know Senator Obama's beloved mother and grandparents would have been thrilled to watch the child they raised ascend the steps of the Capitol -- and take his oath to uphold the Constitution of thegreatest nation on the face of the earth. Last night I extended an invitation to the President-elect and Mrs. Obama to come to theWhite House. And Laura and I are looking forward to welcoming them as soon as possible. Thank you very much.",bush
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is a difficult moment for America. I, unfortunately, will be going back to Washington after my remarks. Secretary Rod Paige and [the] Lt. Governor will take the podium and discuss education. I do want to thank the folkshere at -- at Booker Elementary School for their hospitality. Today, we've had a national tragedy. Two airplanes have crashed into the World Trade Centerin an apparent terrorist attack on our country. I have spoken to the Vice President, to the Governor of New York, to the Director of the FBI, and have ordered that the full resources of the federal government go to help the victims and their families, and -- and to conduct a full-scale investigation to hunt down and to find thosefolks who committed this act. Terrorism against our nation will not stand. And now if you [would] join me in a moment of silence. May God bless the victims, their families, and America. Thank you very much.",bush
"Thank you all for coming. Mr. Vice President and Lynne, thank you for being here with us.Laura and I welcome you to the South Lawn -- better known as Barney's playground. I want to thank members of my Cabinet who've joined us. We've just finished a Cabinet meeting, and it gave me a chance to tell them how much I appreciate the good work they'redoing during this critical time for our nation. I also appreciate the men and women who make up the Executive Office of the President for joining us today. Some of you have been at the White House for just a few months. Others arrived the same day that we did nearly eight years ago. You're the ones who can tell that my hair has gotten a little grayer. Others are career employees who have been here for 30, or40, sometimes 50 years. I can tell that your hair has gotten grayer. The people on this lawn represent diverse backgrounds, talents, and experiences. Yet we all share a steadfast devotion to the United States. We believe that service to our fellow citizensis a noble calling -- and the privilege of a lifetime. This is an exciting time for our country. Earlier this week, more than 120 million people voted for a new President and Congress -- one of the largest turnouts in the history of the country. No matter how we cast our ballots, this election gives us all reason to be proud of our democracy and our country. And I hope you will join Laura and me in congratulatingPresident-Elect Obama, and wishing him the very best for his family and our country. Just before our inauguration in 2001, Laura and I went back to Midland, Texas -- she was born there and I was raised there. I said that Laura and I would ""never quite settle in Washington."" I told them: ""While the honor is great, the work is temporary."" This is true for many of us here today. This peaceful transfer of power is one of the hallmarks of a true democracy. And ensuring that this transition is as smooth as possible is a priority for the rest of my presidency. We face economic challenges that will not pause to let a new President settle in. This will also be America's first wartime presidential transition in four decades. We're in a struggle against violent extremists determined to attack us -- and they would like nothingmore than to exploit this period of change to harm the American people. So over the next 75 days, all of us must ensure that the next President and his team can hit the ground running. For more than a year now, departments and agencies throughout the federal government have been preparing for a smooth transition. We've provided intelligence briefings to the President-Elect, and the Department of Justice has approved security clearances for members of his transition staff. In the coming weeks, we will ask administration officials to brief the Obama team on ongoing policy issues, ranging from the financial markets to the war in Iraq. I look forward to discussing those issues with the President-Elect early nextweek. Offices within the White House are at work preparing extensive transition materials. We're preparing career employees throughout the administration to take on added responsibilities tohelp prevent any disruption to the essential functions of the federal government. Taken together, these measures represent an unprecedented effort to ensure that the executive branch is prepared to fulfill its responsibilities at all times. As we carry out this transition I know that you will continue to conduct yourselves with the decency andprofessionalism you have shown throughout my time in office. A successful transition is just one of many important tasks remaining in our last 75 days. To help address the global financial crisis, the Secretary of Treasury is working endless hours, and I will host an international summit here in Washington on November the 15th. This will bea historic meeting -- and I'm confident that you will work hard to help make it a success. We'll also keep urging Congress to approve America's free trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. And we will continue to protect this homeland by defeating theterrorists and extremists abroad, so we do not have to face them here at home. As January 20th draws near, some of you may be anxious about finding a new job, or a new place to live. I know how you feel. But between now and then, we must keep our attention on the task at hand -- because the American people expect no less. Earlier this year, I promised that I would sprint to the finish. I am keeping that promise, and I know I have given some of you a good workout along the way. As we head into this final stretch, I ask you to remain focused on the goals ahead. I will be honored to stand with you at the finish line. May God bless you.",bush
"Thank  you.   Fellow  citizens,  for  eight  years  it  has  been  my  honor  to  serve  as  your  President.  The  first   decade  of  this  new  century  has  been  a  period  of  consequence,  a  time  set  apart.  Tonight,  with   a  thankful  heart,  I  have  asked  for  a  final  opportunity  to  share  some  thoughts  on  the  journey   that  we  have  traveled  together  and  the  future  of  our  nation.   Five  days  from  now,  the  world  will  witness  the  vitality  of  American  democracy.  In  a  tradition   dating  back  to  our  founding,  the  presidency  will  pass  to  a  successor  chosen  by  you,  the   American  people.  Standing  on  the  steps  of  the  Capitol  will  be  a  man  whose  history  reflects  the   enduring  promise  of  our  land.  This  is  a  moment  of  hope  and  pride  for  our  whole  nation.  And  I   join  all  Americans  in  offering  best  wishes  to  President  elect  Obama,  his  wife,  Michelle,  and   their  two  beautiful  girls.   Tonight,  I  am  filled  with  gratitude  to  Vice  President  Cheney  and  members  of  my   Administration    to  Laura,  who  brought  joy  to  this  house  and  love  to  my  life    to  our  wonderful   daughters,  Barbara  and  Jenna    to  my  parents,  whose  examples  have  provided  strength  for  a   lifetime.  And  above  all,  I  thank  the  American  people  for  the  trust  you  have  given  me.  I  thank   you  for  the  prayers  that  have  lifted  my  spirits.  And  I  thank  you  for  the  countless  acts  of   courage,  generosity,  and  grace  that  I  have  witnessed  these  past  eight  years. A R merican hetoric.com.       Copyright  2011.   Page  1   A  Am  me  er  ri  ic  ca  an  nR  Rh  he  et  to  or  ri  ic  c.  .c  co  om  m   This  evening,  my  thoughts  return  to  the  first  night  I  addressed  you  from  this  House,   September  the  11th,  2001.  That  morning,  terrorists  took  nearly  3,000  lives  in  the  worst  attack   on  America  since  Pearl  Harbor.  I  remember  standing  in  the  rubble  of  the  World  Trade  Center   three  days  later,  surrounded  by  rescuers  who  had  been  working  around  the  clock.  I  remember   talking  to  brave  souls  who  charged  through  smoke  filled  corridors  at  the  Pentagon  and  to   husbands  and  wives  whose  loved  ones  became  heroes  aboard  Flight  93.  I  remember  Arlene   Howard,  who  gave  me  her  fallen  son's  police  shield  as  a  reminder  of  all  that  was  lost.  And  I   still  carry  his  badge.  As  the  years  passed,  most  Americans  were  able  to  return  to  life  much  as   it  had  been  before  9/11.  But  I  never  did.  Every  morning,  I  received  a  briefing  on  the  threats   to  our  nation.  I  vowed  to  do  everything  in  my  power  to  keep  us  safe.   Over  the  past  seven  years,  a  new  Department  of  Homeland  Security  has  been  created.  The   military,  the  intelligence  community,  and  the  FBI  have  been  transformed.  Our  nation  is   equipped  with  new  tools  to  monitor  the  terrorists'  movements,  freeze  their  finances,  and   break  up  their  plots.  And  with  strong  allies  at  our  side,  we  have  taken  the  fight  to  the   terrorists  and  those  who  support  them.  Afghanistan  has  gone  from  a  nation  where  the  Taliban   harbored  Al  Qaeda  and  stoned  women  in  the  streets  to  a  young  democracy  that  is  fighting   terror  and  encouraging  girls  to  go  to  school.  Iraq  has  gone  from  a  brutal  dictatorship  and  a   sworn  enemy  of  America  to  an  Arab  democracy  at  the  heart  of  the  Middle  East  and  a  friend  of   the  United  States.   There's  legitimate  debate  about  many  of  these  decisions.  But  there  can  be  little  debate  about   the  results.  America  has  gone  more  than  seven  years  without  another  terrorist  attack  on  our   soil.  This  is  a  tribute  to  those  who  toil  night  and  day  to  keep  us  safe        law  enforcement   officers,  intelligence  analysts,  homeland  security  and  diplomatic  personnel,  and  the  men  and   women  of  the  United  States  Armed  Forces.   Our  nation  is  blessed  to  have  citizens  who  volunteer  to  defend  us  in  this  time  of  danger.  I   have  cherished  meeting  these  selfless  patriots  and  their  families.  And  America  owes  you  a   debt  of  gratitude.  And  to  all  our  men  and  women  in  uniform  listening  tonight:  There  has  been   no  higher  honor  than  serving  as  your  Commander  in  Chief.   The  battles  waged  by  our  troops  are  part  of  a  broader  struggle  between  two  dramatically   different  systems.  Under  one,  a  small  band  of  fanatics  demands  total  obedience  to  an   oppressive  ideology,  condemns  women  to  subservience,  and  marks  unbelievers  for  murder.   The  other  system  is  based  on  the  conviction  that  freedom  is  the  universal  gift  of  Almighty  God   and  that  liberty  and  justice  light  the  path  to  peace.   This  is  the  belief  that  gave  birth  to  our  nation,  and  in  the  long  run,  advancing  this  belief  is  the   only  practical  way  to  protect  our  citizens.  When  people  live  in  freedom,  they  do  not  willingly   choose  leaders  who  pursue  campaigns  of  terror.  When  people  have  hope  in  the  future,  they   will  not  cede  their  lives  to  violence  and  extremism.  So  around  the  world,  America  is  promoting   human  liberty,  human  rights,  and  human  dignity.  We're  standing  with  dissidents  and  young A R merican hetoric.com.

And  this  great  republic,  born  alone  in  liberty,  is   leading  the  world  toward  a  new  age  when  freedom  belongs  to  all  nations.   For  eight  years,  we've  also  strived  to  expand  opportunity  and  hope  here  at  home.  Across  our   country,  students  are  rising  to  meet  higher  standards  in  public  schools.  A  new  Medicare   prescription  drug  benefit  is  bringing  peace  of  mind  to  seniors  and  the  disabled.  Every  taxpayer   pays  lower  income  taxes.  The  addicted  and  suffering  are  finding  new  hope  through  face         faith  based  programs.  Vulnerable  human  life  is  better  protected.  Funding  for  our  veterans  has   nearly  doubled.  America's  air  and  water  and  lands  are  measurably  cleaner.  And  the  Federal   bench  includes  wise  new  members  like  Justice  Sam  Alito  and  Chief  Justice  John  Roberts.   When  challenges  to  our  prosperity  emerged,  we  rose  to  meet  them.  Facing  the  prospect  of  a   financial  collapse,  we  took  decisive  measures  to  safeguard  our  economy.  These  are  very  tough   times  for  hardworking  families,  but  the  toll  would  be  far  worse  if  we  had  not  acted.  All   Americans  are  in  this  together.  And  together,  with  determination  and  hard  work,  we  will   restore  our  economy  to  the  path  of  growth.  We  will  show  the  world  once  again  the  resilience   of  America's  free  enterprise  system.   Like  all  who  have  held  this  office  before  me,  I  have  experienced  setbacks.  And  there  are   things  I  would  do  differently  if  given  the  chance.  Yet  I've  always  acted  with  the  best  interests   of  our  country  in  mind.  I  have  followed  my  conscience  and  done  what  I  thought  was  right.  You   may  not  agree  with  some  of  the  tough  decisions  I  have  made.  But  I  hope  you  can  agree  that  I   was  willing  to  make  the  tough  decisions.   The  decades  ahead  will  bring  more  hard  choices  for  our  country,  and  there  are  some  guiding   principles  that  shape        should  shape  our  course.  While  our  nation  is  safer  than  it  was  seven   years  ago,  the  gravest  threat  to  our  people  remains  another  terrorist  attack.  Our  enemies  are   patient  and  determined  to  strike  again.  America  did  nothing  to  seek  or  deserve  this  conflict,   but  we  have  been  given  solemn  responsibilities,  and  we  must  meet  them.  We  must  resist   complacency.  We  must  keep  our  resolve.  And  we  must  never  let  down  our  guard.   At  the  same  time,  we  must  continue  to  engage  the  world  with  confidence  and  clear  purpose.   In  the  face  of  threats  from  abroad,  it  can  be  tempting  to  seek  comfort  by  turning  inward.  But   we  must  reject  isolationism  and  its  companion,  protectionism.  Retreating  behind  our  borders   would  only  invite  danger.  In  the  21st  century,  security  and  prosperity  at  home  depend  on  the   expansion  of  liberty  abroad.  If  America  does  not  lead  the  cause  of  freedom,  that  cause  will  not   be  led.   As  we  address  these  challenges        and  others  we  cannot  foresee  tonight        America  must   maintain  our  moral  clarity.

Murdering  the  innocent  to  advance  an  ideology  is  wrong  every  time,  everywhere.   Freeing  people  from  oppression  and  despair  is  eternally  right.  This  nation  must  continue  to   speak  out  for  justice  and  truth.  We  must  always  be  willing  to  act  in  their  defense  and  to   advance  the  cause  of  peace.   President  Thomas  Jefferson  once  wrote,  ""I  like  the  dreams  of  the  future  better  than  the   history  of  the  past.""  As  I  leave  the  House  he  occupied  two  centuries  ago,  I  share  that   optimism.  America  is  a  young  country,  full  of  vitality,  constantly  growing  and  renewing  itself.   And  even  in  the  toughest  times,  we  lift  our  eyes  to  the  broad  horizon  ahead.   I  have  confidence  in  the  promise  of  America  because  I  know  the  character  of  our  people.  This   is  a  nation  that  inspires  immigrants  to  risk  everything  for  the  dream  of  freedom.  This  is  a   nation  where  citizens  show  calm  in  times  of  danger  and  compassion  in  the  face  of  suffering.   We  see  examples  of  America's  character  all  around  us.  And  Laura  and  I  have  invited  some  of   them  to  join  us  in  the  White  House  this  evening.   We  see  America's  character  in  Dr.  Tony  Recasner,  a  principal  who  opened  a  new  charter   school  from  the  ruins  of  Hurricane  Katrina.  We  see  it  in  Julio  Medina,  a  former  inmate  who   leads  a  faith  based  program  to  help  prisoners  returning  to  society.  We  see  it  in  Staff  Sergeant   Aubrey  McDade,  who  charged  into  an  ambush  in  Iraq  and  rescued  three  of  his  fellow  Marines.   We  see  America's  character  in  Bill  Krissoff,  a  surgeon  from  California.  His  son  Nathan,  a   Marine,  gave  his  life  in  Iraq.  When  I  met  Dr.  Krissoff  and  his  family,  he  delivered  some   surprising  news:  He  told  me  he  wanted  to  join  the  Navy  Medical  Corps  in  honor  of  his  son.   This  good  man  was  60  years  old        18  years  above  the  age  limit.  But  his  petition  for  a  waiver   was  granted,  and  for  the  past  year  he  has  trained  in  battlefield  medicine.  Lieutenant   Commander  Krissoff  could  not  be  here  tonight,  because  he  will  soon  deploy  to  Iraq,  where  he   will  help  save  America's  wounded  warriors  and  uphold  the  legacy  of  his  fallen  son.   In  citizens  like  these,  we  see  the  best  of  our  country        resilient  and  hopeful,  caring  and   strong.  These  virtues  give  me  an  unshakable  faith  in  America.  We  have  faced  danger  and  trial,   and  there's  more  ahead.  But  with  the  courage  of  our  people  and  confidence  in  our  ideals,  this   great  nation  will  never  tire,  never  falter,  and  never  fail.   It  has  been  the  privilege  of  a  lifetime  to  serve  as  your  President.  There  have  been  good  days   and  tough  days.  But  every  day  I  have  been  inspired  by  the  greatness  of  our  country  and   uplifted  by  the  goodness  of  our  people.  I  have  been  blessed  to  represent  this  nation  we  love.

"Good morning. For the last eight years, I have had the honor of speaking to the American people Saturday mornings through this radio address. In hundreds of broadcasts, I have talked to you about important issues affecting our security and our prosperity. And today, inmy final address, I want to send a simple and heartfelt message: Thank you. Eight years ago, Laura and I left our home in Texas to come to Washington. Through two terms in the White House, we have been blessed by your kind words and generous prayers. We have been inspired by those of you who reach out to feed the hungry, clothe the needy, and care for the sick. We have been moved by the courage and devotion of those of you whowear the uniform. Serving as your President has been an incredible honor. Like every individual who has held this office before me, I have experienced setbacks. There are things I would do differently if given the chance. Yet I've always acted with the best interests of our country in mind. I have followed my conscience and done what I thought was right. You may not agree with some tough decisions I have made. But I hope you can agreethat I was willing to make the tough decisions. The decades ahead will bring more hard choices for our country, and there are some guiding principles that should shape our course. While our Nation is safer than it was seven years ago, the gravest threat to our people remains another terrorist attack. Our enemies are patient, and determined to strike again. America did nothing to seek or deserve this conflict. But we have been given solemn responsibilities, and we must meet them. We must resistcomplacency. We must keep our resolve. And we must never let down our guard. At the same time, we must continue to engage the world with confidence and clear purpose. In the face of threats from abroad, it can be tempting to seek comfort by turning inward. But we must reject isolationism and its companion, protectionism. Retreating behind our borders would only invite danger. In the 21st century, security and prosperity at home depend on the expansion of liberty abroad. If America does not lead the cause of freedom, that cause will notbe led. As we address these challenges -- and others we cannot foresee today -- America must maintain our moral clarity. I've often spoken to you about good and evil. This has made some uncomfortable. But good and evil are present in this world, and between the two there can be no compromise. Murdering the innocent to advance an ideology is wrong every time, everywhere. Freeing people from oppression and despair is eternally right. This nation must continue to speak out for justice and truth. We must always be willing to act in their defense - - and to advance the cause of peace. Eight years ago, on a cold January morning, I stood on the steps of the United States Capitol, placed my hand on the Bible, and swore a sacred oath to defend our people and our Constitution. On that day, I spoke of ""our nation's grand story of courage and its simple dream of dignity."" Next week, my term of service will come to an end -- but that story andthat dream will continue. On Tuesday, Laura and I will join all Americans in offering our best wishes to President Obama, his wife Michelle, and their two beautiful girls. And later that day, we will return to the love of family and friends in Texas. I will depart office proud of my Administration's record. And I will spend the rest of my life grateful for the opportunity to have served as President ofthe greatest nation on Earth. Thank you for listening.",bush

With the distance of a decade, 9/11 can feel like a part of a different era. But for the families of the men and women stolen, some of whom join us today, that day will never feel like history.

September the 11th, 2001, innocent men and women went to work at the World Trade Center. They reported for duty at the Pentagon. They boarded American Flights 11 and 77, United Flights 93 and 175. They did nothing to provoke or deserve the deliberate act ofmurder that al Qaeda carried out. One of the lessons of 9/11 is that evil is real, and so is courage. When the planes struck the World Trade Center, firefighters and police officers charged up the stairs into the flames. Asthe towers neared collapse, they continued the rescue efforts. Ultimately, more than 400 police officers and firefighters gave their lives. Among them was the chief of the New York City Fire Department, Peter Gancy. As a colleague put it, he wouldnever ask anyone to do something he didn't do himself. The Pentagon service members and civilians pulled friends and strangers from burning rubble. One special forces soldier recalls reaching through a cloud of smoke in search of the wounded. As he entered one room, he prayed to find someone alive. He discovered a severely burned woman and carried her to safety. They later met in the hospital, where she explained thatshe'd been praying for rescue. She called him her guardian angel. And then there's the extraordinary story we commemorate here. Aboard United Airlines Flight 93 were college students from California, an iron worker from New Jersey, veterans of the Korean War and World War II, citizens of Germany and Japan, a pilot who had rearranged hisschedule so that he could take his wife on a vacation to celebrate their anniversary. When the passengers and crew realized the plane had been hijacked, they reported the news calmly. When they learned that the terrorists had crashed other planes into targets on the ground, they accepted greater responsibilities. In the back of the cabin, the passengersgathered to devise a strategy. Copyright Restrictions Unknown. At the moment America's democracy was under attack, our citizens defied their captors by holding a vote. The choice they made would cost them their lives, and they knew it. Many passengers called their loved ones to say goodbye; then hung up to perform their final act. One said, ""They're getting ready to break into the cockpit. I have to go. I love you."" Anothersaid, ""It's up to us. I think we can do it."" In one of the most stirring accounts, Todd Beamer, a father of two with a pregnant wife with a home in New Jersey, asked the air phone operator to join him in reciting the Lord's Prayer.Then he helped lead the charge to the front of the plane with the words ""Let's roll."" With their selfless act, the men and women who stormed the cockpit lived out the words,""Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.""1 And with their brave decision, they launched the first counter offensive of the war on terror. The most likely target of the hijacked plane was the United States Capitol. We'll never know how many innocent people might have been lost, but we do know this: Americans are alive today because the passengers and crew of Flight 93 chose to act, and our nation will be forevergrateful. The 40 souls who perished on the plane left a great deal behind. They left spouses and children and grandchildren who miss them dearly. They left successful businesses and promising careers and a lifetime of dreams that they will never have the chance to fulfill. Theyleft something else: a legacy of bravery and selflessness that will always inspire America. For generations people will study the flight, the story of Flight 93. They will learn that individual choices make a difference, that love and sacrifice can triumph over evil and hate, and that what happened above this Pennsylvania field ranks among the most courageous actsin American history. The memorial we dedicate today will ensure our nation always remembers those lost here on 9/11. But we have a duty beyond memory. We have a duty beyond honoring. We have a duty to live our lives in a way that upholds the ideals for which the men and women gave their lives, to build a living memorial to their courage and sacrifice. We have a duty to find commonpurpose as a nation. Copyright Restrictions Unknown. In the days after 9/11, the response came like a single hand over a single heart. Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle gathered on the steps of the capitol and sang ""God blessAmerica."" Neighbors reached out to neighbors of all backgrounds and beliefs. The past decade, our country has been tested by natural disaster, economic turmoil, anxieties and challenges here at home and abroad. There have been spirited debates along the way. It's the essence of democracy. But Americans have never been defined by our disagreements. Whatever challenges we face today and in the future, we must never lose faith in our ability tomeet them together. We must never allow our differences to harden into divisions. Second, we have a duty to remain engaged in the world. 9/11 proved that the conditions in the country on the other side of the world can have an impact on our own streets. It may be tempting to think it doesn't matter what happens to a villager in Afghanistan or a child inAfrica, but the temptation of isolation is deadly wrong. World repression and anger and resentment will be a never ending source of violence and threats. A world of dignity and liberty and hope will be safer and better for all. The surest wayto move toward that vision is for the United States of America to lead the cause of freedom. Finally, we each have a duty to serve a cause larger than ourselves. The passengers aboard Flight 93 set an example that inspires us all. Many have followed their path of service by donating blood or mentoring a child or volunteering in desperate corners of the earth. Some have devoted their careers to analyzing intelligence or protecting our borders and securing ourskies. Others have made the noble choice to defend our nation in battle. For 10 years, our troops have risked and given their lives to prevent our enemies from attacking America again. They've kept us safe; they have made us proud; and they haveupheld the spirit of service shown by the passengers on Flight 93. Many years ago in 1863, another President came to dedicate a memorial site in this state. Hetold his audience that: In a larger sense we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow thisground. For the brave souls who struggled there, it consecrated it far above our poorpower to add or detract. Copyright Restrictions Unknown. He added, ""The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can neverforget what they did here."" So it is with Flight 93. For as long as this memorial stands, we will remember what the men and women aboard the plane did here. We'll pay tribute to the courage they showed, the sacrifice they made, and thelives they spared. The United States will never forget. May God bless you all. Copyright Restrictions Unknown.",bush
"Thank you all. As has been mentioned, in 2006 Laura and I came here to Warren EastonCharter High School a year after Katrina hit, and we are honored and pleased to be back inthe 10th anniversary of that devastating storm. I can   t think of a better place to come here inNew Orleans, except for some of the restaurants. The slogan that guided the school when we first visited is true today:    We believe in success.    And because of that success, that schools like this have achieved, you   ve given all Americansreason to believe that New Orleans is back and better than ever. Mr. Mayor, thank you for your hospitality. You and the First Lady have been so gracious tous, and we want to thank you for your leadership. If enthusiasm and a good strategy counts,New Orleans is going to be -- is in good hands. And we thank you very much. Copyright Restrictions Unknown. By the way, I do bring greetings from one of the co-chairmen of the Bush KatrinaFund: [President George H.W. Bush] 41. He had one of the great lines of all time. He said,   Who would have thought getting out of bed at age 91 would be more dangerous thanjumping out of an airplane at age 90?    I want to thank David Garland, President of the Warren Easton Charter Foundation Board. Iwant to thank all the folks who have shown up. As Laura said, we had a roundtablediscussion. Many of our friends were there, people we worked with. I think of NormanFrancis for example, one of the great leaders of New Orleans, one of the great minds of NewOrleans. In spite of the devastation, we have many fond memories. I remember sitting with [GeneralRussel L.] Honor   on top one of those big ships, strategizing. I think you were drinking; Iwasn   t of course. But it   s...great to see you. Surely, we   re honored that you took time tocome. Obviously, members of Congress, members of the State House, Superintendent White,on and on, thank you all for coming. I really want to thank the leadership of the school and we   ll talk about them here in a minute.Although I must confess, the Principal is always a teacher. So she tried to teach me how tosecond line with the band here at Warren Easton. I -- I know she didn   t say it, but she wasthinking,    This, this boy needs a lot of work.    So we   re thrilled with your hospitality. In a cruel twist, Hurricane Katrina brought despair during what should have been a season ofhope -- the start of the new school year. Students who had recently gone back to schoolsuddenly had no school to go back to. Many had nowhere to live. The floodwaters, as you allknow better than most, claimed schools and homes alike. As Laura mentioned, the stand --the ground we   re on today was underwater. All of us who are old enough to remember willnever forget the images of our fellow Americans amid a sea of misery and ruin. We   ll alwaysremember the lives lost across the Gulf Coast. Their memories are in our hearts and I hopeyou pray for their families. Hurricane Katrina is a story of loss beyond measure. It   s also a story of commitment andcompassion. I hope you remember what I remember, and that is 30,000 people were saved in theimmediate aftermath of the storm by U.S. military personnel, by Louisiana law enforcement,and by citizens who volunteered. Copyright Restrictions Unknown. I hope you remember what I remember, and that was the thousands who came here on avolunteer basis to provide food for the hungry and to help find shelter for those who had nohome to live in. There are people all around our country who prayed for you, many of whomshowed up so they could say they helped a fellow citizen who was hurting. One of the groups that stepped forward to serve were the educators of New Orleans. At atime when it would have been easy to walk away from the wreckage, the educators heretoday thought of the children who would be left behind. You understood that bringing NewOrleans back to life requires getting students back to school. And even though some of theeducators had lost almost everything you owned, you let nothing stand in your way. Today,we celebrate the resurgence of New Orleans    schools. We honor the resilience of a greatAmerican city whose levees gave out but whose people never gave up. Out of the devastation of Katrina, you vowed to do more than just open the schools. Youvowed to challenge the status quo. Long before the great flood, too many students in this citydrifted from grade to grade without ever learning the skills needed for success. Parents   lacked choices and the power to intervene. Principals and teachers lacked the authority tochart a more hopeful course. It was a system that stranded more than 60 percent of thestudents failing in schools. It was what I called ""the soft bigotry of low expectations.""1 The decisions made in the dark hours after Katrina sparked a decade of reform. Rather thanjust reopen the schools, we organized many into charter schools that are independentlyoperated but publicly accountable for achieving high standards. More than nine in ten publicschool students in this city now call [a] charter school home. Administrators at these schoolshave the freedom to slice through red tape and the freedom to innovate. Parents at theseschools have choices if dissatisfied. And the results at these schools have beenextraordinary. The reason we know is because we measure, and any attempt to undermineaccountability in our school system does a huge disservice to the students who go to theschools in New Orleans. According to the new report2 by the Cowen Institute, [the] percentage in New Orleans   students graduating on time has soared since Katrina. [The] percentage of students whoattended schools that score better than the state average almost doubled, and so has thepercentage of students meeting basic standards. And you   ve got to ask,    Why?    It just didn   thappen. A lot of it [was] structural, and a lot of it requires strong leadership -- people whostared into the eye of the storm and who refused to back down. And so Laura and I are herein New Orleans to remind our country about what strong leadership means, and we   re here tosalute the leaders. Copyright Restrictions Unknown. I think of Jenny Rious here at Warren Easton. After Katrina, Jenny left New Orleans and wasforced to leave New Orleans. She started a website called    Warren Easton in Exile.    The sitereunited students scattered across the country around a vision for returning to New Orleansand reopening this school. When Jenny returned to New Orleans, the first place she went wasnot her house. It was this school. And as she put it,    I would rather see my own house burndown than this school.    Jenny would give anything for Easton and today, we give teacherslike hers our sincere thanks. [It   s] amazing what happened in this city after the storm wiped out the school system. Educational entrepreneurs decided to do something about the devastation and the failure. I   ve met a lot of them when I was President, and subsequent to my presidency. NeeravKingsland is one such person. He took a leadership role at an organization called    NewSchools for New Orleans.    He worked with others to help launch dozens of new schools and toturn ideas in -- to reform into reality. In other words, this isn't a theoretical exercise. It   simportant for our country to look at New Orleans and realize this is an exercise ofimplementing a plan which works. He -- He, so Neerav was so encouraged by what he sees here that he -- he   s talking up thereforms to other cities around the country. Isn   t it amazing? The storm that nearly destroysNew Orleans, and yet now New -- New Orleans is the beacon for school reform. Neeravrepresent[s] the virtues that Bill Clinton and I had in mind when we announced the newPresidential Leadership Scholars program, and we   re honored that Neerav was among the firstclass of scholars. Achieving these results took librarians who salvaged their collections from wateringwreckage. Listen, I know something about librarians. I married one. I   m really proud of theLaura Bush Foundation. She   s talked about the Grants -- talked about Pam and Marshall. These are citizens who supported this Foundation who, if they   d been in New Orleans, theydidn   t stay very long. And yet, like many around the country, they care deeply about thefuture of this city. I hope the students here -- I   m really thrilled you   re here by the way andthank you for staying awake. I hope you realize the compassion of others in helping yourealize a good education. It turns out that every good school, a school that   s succeeding -- a school that' succeeding --and we know it   s succeeding, because we measure against other standards -- requires strongprincipals. And there   s no doubt that Lexi Medley is a strong leader. I love when she says --when she says,    If you fail, we fail. The student   s our product. We don   t believe in puttingout anything but the best.    Copyright Restrictions Unknown. In order to succeed, in order to lead properly, you   ve got to set high goals and highexpectations. And that   s what Lexi and this school have done. As you heard, this school hasgraduated 100 percent of its seniors for the past five years. Lexi, you   ve earned ouradmiration and our gratitude, along with our best wishes for a happy birthday tomorrow. It   s the stories of schools like this one and others that we see a determination to rebuild betterthan before. And it -- it's a spirit much stronger than any storm. It   s a spirit that   s liftedcommunities laid low by tornadoes or terrorist attacks. It   s a spirit that I saw in New Orleansten years ago, and that is very evident today. We see that spirit in the population that has ticked back up as families settle back down. Wesee it in the tourists who are drawn here not only by this city   s rich heritage but the new hotelrooms and restaurants. We see it in the spirit in Lauren LeDuff. As Laura mentioned --Lauren mentioned -- Laura and I first met her in 2006 when she was a senior at Easton. She's happy to be back at the school she loved -- She was happy to be back at the school sheloved at the time. And you know what she told me? She said,    I want to be a teacher.    Andhere she is as a member of this faculty, teaching English. I probably needed her when I wasin high school. When asked how students have overcome adversity, Lauren says,    We teachour kids to be resilient. That   s in the culture of this city.    Lauren's right. The resilience you teach at Warren Easton is the same resilience that this cityshowed the world in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. On this anniversary, the work of makinga stronger and more hopeful New Orleans goes on. You   ve achieved a lot over the last tenyears. And with belief in success, and a faith in God, New Orleans will achieve even more. The darkness from a decade ago has lifted. The Crescent City has risen again. And its bestdays lie ahead. Thank you for having me. 1 Phrase origin credited to Michael Gerson and perhaps first used in presidential candidate George W. Bush's Address to the NAACP.

"Thank you, Senator. I, too, am really pleased that President Obama and Mrs. Obama have come down to Dallas. I also want to welcome [the] vice president and Mrs. Biden; Mr. Mayor;Chief Brown; elected officials; members of the law enforcement community. Today the nation grieves, but those of us who love Dallas and call it home have had five deaths in the family. Laura and I see members of law enforcement every day. We count -- We count them as our friends. And we know, like for every other American, that their courage isour protection and shield. We   re proud of the men we mourn and the community that has rallied to honor them and support the wounded. Our mayor and police chief and our police department have beenmighty inspirations for the rest of the nation. Copyright Restrictions Unknown. These slain officers were the best among us: - Lorne Ahrens, beloved husband to detective Katrina Ahrens and father of two; - Michael Krol, caring son, brother, uncle, nephew, and friend; - Michael Smith, U.S. Army veteran, devoted husband, and father of two; - Brent Thompson, Marine Corps vet, recently married; - Patrick Zamarippa, U.S. Navy Reserve combat veteran, proud father, and loyal TexasRangers fan. With their deaths, we have lost so much. We are grief stricken, heartbroken, and forevergrateful. Every officer has accepted a calling that sets them apart. Most of us imagine if the moment called for, that we would risk our lives to protect a spouse or a child. Those wearing the uniform assume that risk for the safety of strangers. They and their families share theunspoken knowledge that each new day can bring new dangers. But none of us were prepared, or could be prepared, for an ambush by hatred and malice. Theshock of this evil still has not faded. At times it seems like the forces pulling us apart are stronger than the forces binding us together. Argument turns too easily into animosity. Disagreement escalates too quickly intode-humanization. Too often we judge other groups by their worst examples, while judging ourselves by our best intentions. And this has -- And this has strained our bonds of understanding and commonpurpose. Copyright Restrictions Unknown. But Americans, I think, have a great advantage. To renew our unity, we only need to remember our values. We have never been held together by blood or background. We arebound by things of the spirit, by shared commitments to common ideals. At our best, we practice empathy, imagining ourselves in the lives and circumstances ofothers. This is the bridge across our nation   s deepest divisions. And it's not merely a matter of tolerance, but of learning from the struggles and stories of ourfellow citizens and finding our better selves in the process. At our best, we honor the image of God we see in one another. We recognize that we are brothers and sisters, sharing the same brief moment on Earth and owing each other theloyalty of our shared humanity. At our best, we know we have one country, one future, one destiny. We do not want the unity of grief, nor do we want the unity of fear. We want the unity of hope, affection, and highpurpose. We know that the kind of just, humane country we -- we want to build, that we have seen in our best dreams, is made possible when men and women in uniform stand guard. At theirbest, when they   re trained and trusted and accountable, they free us from fear. The Apostle Paul said,    For God gave us a spirit not of fear, but of strength and love and self- control.   1 Those are the best responses to fear in the life of our country; and they   re the codeof the peace officer. Today, all of us feel a sense of loss -- but not equally. I   d like to conclude with the word of the families, the spouses, and especially the children of the fallen: Your loved one[   s] time with you was too short. They did not get a chance to properly say goodbye. But they went where duty called. They defended us, even to the end. They finished well. We will not forget whatthey did for us. Copyright Restrictions Unknown. Your loss is unfair. We cannot explain it. We can stand beside you and share your grief. And we can pray that God will comfort you with a hope deeper than sorrow and stronger thandeath. May God bless you. 1 2 Timothy 1: 7 Copyright Restrictions Unknown.",bush
"Laura has been very much engaged in this museum for a long time. She sits on the board.And we   re honored to be here. My first reaction is I hope all our fellow citizens come and look at this place. It is fabulous. Mr. President and First Lady, Vice President, Chief Justice; David [Skorton], thank you very much; the board. I do want to give a shout out to Lonnie [Bunch]. It   s really important to understand this project would not and could not have happened without his drive, his energy,and his optimism. Now, as Laura mentioned 15 years ago members from both part[ies] -- Congressman John Lewis and Sam Brownback, then-senator from Kansas -- informed me that they were about to introduce legislation creating a new museum to share the stories and celebrate theachievements of African Americans. You know, it would be fair to say that the Congress and I did not always see eye to eye -- if you know what I mean, Mr. President. But this is one issue where we strongly agreed. I was honored to sign the bill [H.R. 3442] authorizing the construction of this national treasure. AndI   m pleased it now stands where it has always belonged, on the National Mall. This museum is an important addition to our country for many reasons. Here are three. First, it shows our commitment to truth. A great nation does not hide its history. It faces its flaws and corrects them. This museum tells the truth that a country founded on the promiseof liberty held millions in chains, that the price of our union was America   s original sin. From the beginning, some spoke to truth -- John Adams, who called slavery an ""evil of Colossal Magnitude"" -- their voices were not heeded, and often not heard. But they were always known to a power greater than any on earth, One who loves His children and meantthem to be free. Second, this museum shows America   s capacity to change. For centuries, slavery and segregation seemed permanent, permanent parts of our national life -- but not to Nat Turner or Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks, or Martin Luther King Jr. All answeredcruelty with courage and hope. In a society governed by the people, no wrong lasts forever. After struggle and sacrifice, the American people, acting through the most democratic of means, amended the constitution that originally treated slaves as three-fifths of a person, to guarantee equal protection of the laws. After a decade of struggle, civil rights acts and voting rights acts were finally enacted. Even today, the journey toward justice is still not complete. But this museum will inspire us togo farther and get there faster. And finally, the museum showcases the talent of some of our finest Americans. The galleries celebrate not only African American equality, but African American greatness. I -- I can't help but note that -- [audience applause]. I cannot help but note that a huge influence in my teenage years is honored here, the great Chuck Berry; or my baseball idol growing up in far West Texas, the great Willie Mays. And of course, something I never really mastered, the ability to give a good speech, but Thurgood Marshall sure could. And some of you may know I   m a fledgling painter, a struggling artist. I have a new appreciation for the artists whose brilliant works are displayed here, people like RobertDuncanson, Henry Ossawa Tanner, Charles Henry Alston. Our country is better and more vibrant because of their contributions and the contributions of millions of African Americans. No telling of American history is neither complete nor accuratewithout acknowledging them. The lesson of this museum is all -- that all Americans share a past and a future by staying true to our principles, righting injustice, and encouraging the empowerment of all. We will bean even greater nation for generations to come. I congratulate all those who played a role in creating this wonderful museum. May God bless us all.",bush
"Freedom itself was attacked this morning by a faceless coward. And freedom will be defended. I want to reassure the American people that full -- the full resources of the federalgovernment are working to assist local authorities to save lives and to help the victims ofthese attacks. Make no mistake, the United States will hunt down and punish those responsible for thesecowardly acts. I've been in regular contact with the Vice President, Secretary of Defense, the nationalsecurity team, and my cabinet. We have taken all appropriate -- appropriate securityprecautions to protect the American people. Our military at home and around the world is on high alert status. And we have taken thenecessary security precautions to continue the functions of your government. We have been in touch with leaders of Congress and with world leaders to assure them thatwe will do what is -- whatever is necessary to protect America and Americans. I ask the American people to join me in saying a ""thanks"" for all the folks who have beenfighting hard to rescue our fellow citizens, and to join me in saying a prayer for the victimsand their families. The resolve of our great nation is being tested, but make no mistake. We will show the worldthat we will pass this test. God bless.",bush
