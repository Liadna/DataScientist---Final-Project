At the same time, I ask the citizens of America to join me in renewing our commitment to the American ideals of fellowship and hope.The obligation of a President is more than the fulfillment of a set of constitutional duties.
The President must carry the mantle of hope and optimism in the battle against fear and despair.
I ask that every American help as we attempt, in the words of the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope and transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood.We must always remember that the essence of our democracy is the recognition that we are united in a common purpose, working toward a common good.In renewing our commitment to fellowship throughout our great Nation, we recall the spirit of Thomas Jefferson, who said on the occasion of his first inaugural address, Let us, then, fellow citizens, unite with one heart and one mind.
