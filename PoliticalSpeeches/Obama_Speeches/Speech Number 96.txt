Thank you.
I want to thank Senator Bill Nelson and NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden for theirextraordinary leadership.  I want to recognize Dr. Buzz Aldrin as well, who’s in the house. Four decades ago, Buzz became a legend.  But in the four decades since he’s also been one ofAmerica’s leading visionaries and authorities on human space flight.
Few people -- present company excluded -- can claim the expertise of Buzz and Bill andCharlie when it comes to space exploration.  I have to say that few people are as singularlyunimpressed by Air Force One as those three.  Sure, it’s comfortable, but it can’t even reachlow Earth orbit.  And that obviously is in striking contrast to the Falcon 9 rocket we just sawon the launch pad, which will be tested for the very first time in the coming weeks.
A couple of other acknowledgments I want to make.  We’ve got Congresswoman SheilaJackson Lee from Texas visiting us, a big supporter of the space program. My director, Officeof Science and Technology Policy -- in other words my chief science advisor -- John Holdren ishere. And most of all I want to acknowledge your congresswoman Suzanne Kosmas, becauseevery time I meet with her, including the flight down here, she reminds me of how importantour NASA programs are and how important this facility is.  And she is fighting for every singleone of you and for her district and for the jobs in her district.  And you should know thatyou’ve got a great champion in Congresswoman Kosmas.  Please give her a big round ofapplause.
  
I also want to thank everybody for participating in today’s conference.  And gathered here arescientists, engineers, business leaders, public servants, and a few more astronauts as well. Last but not least, I want to thank the men and women of NASA for welcoming me to theKennedy Space Center, and for your contributions not only to America, but to the world.
Here at the Kennedy Space Center we are surrounded by monuments and milestones of thosecontributions.  It was from here that NASA launched the missions of Mercury and Gemini andApollo.  It was from here that Space Shuttle Discovery, piloted by Charlie Bolden, carried theHubble Telescope into orbit, allowing us to plumb the deepest recesses of our galaxy.
And I should point out, by the way, that in my private office just off the Oval, I’ve got thepicture of Jupiter from the Hubble.  So thank you, Charlie, for helping to decorate my office. It was from here that men and women, propelled by sheer nerve and talent, set aboutpushing the boundaries of humanity’s reach.
That’s the story of NASA.  And it’s a story that started a little more than half a century ago,far from the Space Coast, in a remote and desolate region of what is now called Kazakhstan. Because it was from there that the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the first artificial satelliteto orbit the Earth, which was little more than a few pieces of metal with a transmitter and abattery strapped to the top of a missile.  But the world was stunned.  Americans weredumbfounded.  The Soviets, it was perceived, had taken the lead in a race for which we werenot yet fully prepared.
But we caught up very quick.  President Eisenhower signed legislation to create NASA and toinvest in science and math education, from grade school to graduate school.  In 1961,President Kennedy boldly declared before a joint session of Congress that the United Stateswould send a man to the Moon and return him safely to the Earth within the decade.  And as anation, we set about meeting that goal, reaping rewards that have in the decades sincetouched every facet of our lives.  NASA was at the forefront.  Many gave their careers to theeffort.  And some have given far more.
In the years that have followed, the space race inspired a generation of scientists andinnovators, including, I’m sure, many of you.  It’s contributed to immeasurable technologicaladvances that have improved our health and well-being, from satellite navigation to waterpurification, from aerospace manufacturing to medical imaging.  Although, I have to say,during a meeting right before I came out on stage somebody said, you know, it’s more thanjust Tang -- and I had to point out I actually really like Tang. I thought that was very cool.
And leading the world to space helped America achieve new heights of prosperity here onEarth, while demonstrating the power of a free and open society to harness the ingenuity ofits people.
And on a personal note, I have been part of that generation so inspired by the spaceprogram.  1961 was the year of my birth -- the year that Kennedy made his announcement. 
  
And one of my earliest memories is sitting on my grandfather’s shoulders, waving a flag asastronauts arrived in Hawaii.  For me, the space program has always captured an essentialpart of what it means to be an American -- reaching for new heights, stretching beyond whatpreviously did not seem possible.  And so, as President, I believe that space exploration is nota luxury, it’s not an afterthought in America’s quest for a brighter future -- it is an essentialpart of that quest.
So today, I’d like to talk about the next chapter in this story.  The challenges facing our spaceprogram are different, and our imperatives for this program are different, than in decadespast.  We’re no longer racing against an adversary.  We’re no longer competing to achieve asingular goal like reaching the Moon.  In fact, what was once a global competition has longsince become a global collaboration.  But while the measure of our achievements has changeda great deal over the past 50 years, what we do -- or fail to do -- in seeking new frontiers isno less consequential for our future in space and here on Earth.
So let me start by being extremely clear:  I am 100 percent committed to the mission ofNASA and its future.  Because broadening our capabilities in space will continue to serve oursociety in ways that we can scarcely imagine.  Because exploration will once more inspirewonder in a new generation -- sparking passions and launching careers.  And because,ultimately, if we fail to press forward in the pursuit of discovery, we are ceding our future andwe are ceding that essential element of the American character.
I know there have been a number of questions raised about my administration’s plan forspace exploration, especially in this part of Florida where so many rely on NASA as a source ofincome as well as a source of pride and community.  And these questions come at a time oftransition, as the space shuttle nears its scheduled retirement after almost 30 years ofservice.  And understandably, this adds to the worries of folks concerned not only about theirown futures but about the future of the space program to which they’ve devoted their lives.
But I also know that underlying these concerns is a deeper worry, one that precedes not onlythis plan but this administration.  It stems from the sense that people in Washington -- drivensometimes less by vision than by politics -- have for years neglected NASA’s mission andundermined the work of the professionals who fulfill it.  We’ve seen that in the NASA budget,which has risen and fallen with the political winds.
But we can also see it in other ways:  in the reluctance of those who hold office to set clear,achievable objectives; to provide the resources to meet those objectives; and to justify notjust these plans but the larger purpose of space exploration in the 21st century.
All that has to change.  And with the strategy I’m outlining today, it will.  We start byincreasing NASA’s budget by $6 billion over the next five years, even -- I want people tounderstand the context of this.  This is happening even as we have instituted a freeze ondiscretionary spending and sought to make cuts elsewhere in the budget.
  
So NASA, from the start, several months ago when I issued my budget, was one of the areaswhere we didn’t just maintain a freeze but we actually increased funding by $6 billion.  Bydoing that we will ramp up robotic exploration of the solar system, including a probe of theSun’s atmosphere; new scouting missions to Mars and other destinations; and an advancedtelescope to follow Hubble, allowing us to peer deeper into the universe than ever before.
We will increase Earth-based observation to improve our understanding of our climate and ourworld -- science that will garner tangible benefits, helping us to protect our environment forfuture generations.
And we will extend the life of the International Space Station likely by more than five years,while actually using it for its intended purpose:  conducting advanced research that can helpimprove the daily lives of people here on Earth, as well as testing and improving upon ourcapabilities in space.  This includes technologies like more efficient life support systems thatwill help reduce the cost of future missions.  And in order to reach the space station, we willwork with a growing array of private companies competing to make getting to space easierand more affordable.
Now, I recognize that some have said it is unfeasible or unwise to work with the private sectorin this way.  I disagree.  The truth is, NASA has always relied on private industry to helpdesign and build the vehicles that carry astronauts to space, from the Mercury capsule thatcarried John Glenn into orbit nearly 50 years ago, to the space shuttle Discovery currentlyorbiting overhead.  By buying the services of space transportation -- rather than the vehiclesthemselves -- we can continue to ensure rigorous safety standards are met.  But we will alsoaccelerate the pace of innovations as companies -- from young startups to established leaders-- compete to design and build and launch new means of carrying people and materials out ofour atmosphere.
In addition, as part of this effort, we will build on the good work already done on the Orioncrew capsule.  I’ve directed Charlie Bolden to immediately begin developing a rescue vehicleusing this technology, so we are not forced to rely on foreign providers if it becomesnecessary to quickly bring our people home from the International Space Station.  And thisOrion effort will be part of the technological foundation for advanced spacecraft to be used infuture deep space missions.  In fact, Orion will be readied for flight right here in this room.
Next, we will invest more than $3 billion to conduct research on an advanced “heavy liftrocket” -- a vehicle to efficiently send into orbit the crew capsules, propulsion systems, andlarge quantities of supplies needed to reach deep space.  In developing this new vehicle, wewill not only look at revising or modifying older models; we want to look at new designs, newmaterials, new technologies that will transform not just where we can go but what we can dowhen we get there.  And we will finalize a rocket design no later than 2015 and then begin tobuild it.  And I want everybody to understand:  That’s at least two years earlier thanpreviously planned -- and that’s conservative, given that the previous program was behindschedule and over budget.
  
At the same time, after decades of neglect, we will increase investment -- right away -- inother groundbreaking technologies that will allow astronauts to reach space sooner and moreoften, to travel farther and faster for less cost, and to live and work in space for longerperiods of time more safely.  That means tackling major scientific and technologicalchallenges.
How do we shield astronauts from radiation on longer missions?  How do we harnessresources on distant worlds?  How do we supply spacecraft with energy needed for these far-
reaching journeys?  These are questions that we can answer and will answer.  And these arethe questions whose answers no doubt will reap untold benefits right here on Earth.
So the point is what we’re looking for is not just to continue on the same path -- we want toleap into the future; we want major breakthroughs; a transformative agenda for NASA.
Now, yes, pursuing this new strategy will require that we revise the old strategy.  In part, thisis because the old strategy -- including the Constellation program -- was not fulfilling itspromise in many ways.  That’s not just my assessment; that’s also the assessment of a panelof respected non-partisan experts charged with looking at these issues closely.  Now, despitethis, some have had harsh words for the decisions we’ve made, including some individualswho I’ve got enormous respect and admiration for.
But what I hope is, is that everybody will take a look at what we are planning, consider thedetails of what we’ve laid out, and see the merits as I’ve described them.  The bottom line isnobody is more committed to manned space flight, to human exploration of space than I am. But we’ve got to do it in a smart way, and we can’t just keep on doing the same old thingsthat we’ve been doing and thinking that somehow is going to get us to where we want to go.
Some have said, for instance, that this plan gives up our leadership in space by failing toproduce plans within NASA to reach low Earth orbit, instead of relying on companies and othercountries.  But we will actually reach space faster and more often under this new plan, inways that will help us improve our technological capacity and lower our costs, which are bothessential for the long-term sustainability of space flight.  In fact, through our plan, we’ll besending many more astronauts to space over the next decade.
There are also those who criticized our decision to end parts of Constellation as one that willhinder space exploration below [sic] low Earth orbit.  But it’s precisely by investing ingroundbreaking research and innovative companies that we will have the potential to rapidlytransform our capabilities -- even as we build on the important work already completed,through projects like Orion, for future missions.  And unlike the previous program, we aresetting a course with specific and achievable milestones.
  
Early in the next decade, a set of crewed flights will test and prove the systems required forexploration beyond low Earth orbit. And by 2025, we expect new spacecraft designed for longjourneys to allow us to begin the first-ever crewed missions beyond the Moon into deepspace. So we’ll start -- we’ll start by sending astronauts to an asteroid for the first time inhistory.  By the mid-2030s, I believe we can send humans to orbit Mars and return themsafely to Earth.  And a landing on Mars will follow.  And I expect to be around to see it.
But I want to repeat -- I want to repeat this:  Critical to deep space exploration will be thedevelopment of breakthrough propulsion systems and other advanced technologies.  So I’mchallenging NASA to break through these barriers.  And we’ll give you the resources to breakthrough these barriers.  And I know you will, with ingenuity and intensity, because that’s whatyou’ve always done.
Now, I understand that some believe that we should attempt a return to the surface of theMoon first, as previously planned.  But I just have to say pretty bluntly here:  We’ve beenthere before.  Buzz has been there.  There’s a lot more of space to explore, and a lot more tolearn when we do.  So I believe it’s more important to ramp up our capabilities to reach -- andoperate at -- a series of increasingly demanding targets, while advancing our technologicalcapabilities with each step forward.  And that’s what this strategy does.  And that’s how wewill ensure that our leadership in space is even stronger in this new century than it was in thelast.
Finally, I want to say a few words about jobs.  Suzanne pointed out to me that the last time Iwas here, I made a very clear promise that I would help in the transition into a new programto make sure that people who are already going through a tough time here in this region werehelped.  And despite some reports to the contrary, my plan will add more than 2,500 jobsalong the Space Coast in the next two years compared to the plan under the previousadministration.  So I want to make that point.
We’re going to modernize the Kennedy Space Center, creating jobs as we upgrade launchfacilities.  And there’s potential for even more jobs as companies in Florida and across Americacompete to be part of a new space transportation industry.  And some of those industryleaders are here today.  This holds the promise of generating more than 10,000 jobsnationwide over the next few years.  And many of these jobs will be created right here inFlorida because this is an area primed to lead in this competition.
Now, it’s true -- there are Floridians who will see their work on the shuttle end as the programwinds down.  This is based on a decision that was made six years ago, not six months ago,but that doesn’t make it any less painful for families and communities affected as this decisionbecomes reality.
  
So I’m proposing -- in part because of strong lobbying by Bill and by Suzanne, as well asCharlie -- I’m proposing a $40 million initiative led by a high-level team from the WhiteHouse, NASA, and other agencies to develop a plan for regional economic growth and jobcreation.  And I expect this plan to reach my desk by August 15th. It’s an effort that will helpprepare this already skilled workforce for new opportunities in the space industry and beyond.
So this is the next chapter that we can write together here at NASA.  We will partner withindustry.  We will invest in cutting-edge research and technology.  We will set far-reachingmilestones and provide the resources to reach those milestones.  And step by step, we willpush the boundaries not only of where we can go but what we can do.
Fifty years after the creation of NASA, our goal is no longer just a destination to reach.  Ourgoal is the capacity for people to work and learn and operate and live safely beyond the Earthfor extended periods of time, ultimately in ways that are more sustainable and evenindefinite.  And in fulfilling this task, we will not only extend humanity’s reach in space -- wewill strengthen America’s leadership here on Earth.
Now, I’ll close by saying this.  I know that some Americans have asked a question that’sparticularly apt on Tax Day:  Why spend money on NASA at all?  Why spend money solvingproblems in space when we don’t lack for problems to solve here on the ground?  Andobviously our country is still reeling from the worst economic turmoil we’ve known ingenerations.  We have massive structural deficits that have to be closed in the coming years.
But you and I know this is a false choice.  We have to fix our economy.  We need to close ourdeficits.  But for pennies on the dollar, the space program has fueled jobs and entireindustries.  For pennies on the dollar, the space program has improved our lives, advancedour society, strengthened our economy, and inspired generations of Americans.  And I haveno doubt that NASA can continue to fulfill this role. But that is why -- but I want to say clearlyto those of you who work for NASA, but to the entire community that has been so supportiveof the space program in this area:  That is exactly why it’s so essential that we pursue a newcourse and that we revitalize NASA and its mission -- not just with dollars, but with clear aimsand a larger purpose.
Now, little more than 40 years ago, astronauts descended the nine-rung ladder of the lunarmodule called Eagle, and allowed their feet to touch the dusty surface of the Earth’s onlyMoon.  This was the culmination of a daring and perilous gambit -- of an endeavor thatpushed the boundaries of our knowledge, of our technological prowess, of our very capacity ashuman beings to solve problems.  It wasn’t just the greatest achievement in NASA’s history --it was one of the greatest achievements in human history.
And the question for us now is whether that was the beginning of something or the end ofsomething.  I choose to believe it was only the beginning.
So thank you.  God bless you.  And may God bless the United States of America. Thank you.
