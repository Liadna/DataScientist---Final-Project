Thank you very much.  Please, please. Thank you.  Well, good morning.  Giving all praise andhonor to God.  It is wonderful to be back with you here.  I want to thank our co-chairs, Boband Roger.  These two don't always agree in the Senate, but in coming together and unitingus all in prayer, they embody the spirit of our gathering today.
I also want to thank everybody who helped organize this breakfast.  It's wonderful to see somany friends and faith leaders and dignitaries.  And Michelle and I are truly honored to bejoining you here today.
I want to offer a special welcome to a good friend, His Holiness the Dalai Lama -- who is apowerful example of what it means to practice compassion, who inspires us to speak up forthe freedom and dignity of all human beings.  I've been pleased to welcome him to the WhiteHouse on many occasions, and we're grateful that he's able to join us here today.
There aren't that many occasions that bring His Holiness under the same roof asNASCAR.  This may be the first.  But God works in mysterious ways.  And so I want to thankDarrell [Waltrip] for that wonderful presentation.  Darrell [Waltrip] knows that when you'regoing 200 miles an hour, a little prayer cannot hurt. I suspect that more than once, Darrellhas had the same thought as many of us have in our own lives -- Jesus, take the wheel. Although I hope that you kept your hands on the wheel when you were thinking that.
  
He and I obviously share something in having married up.  And we are so grateful to Steviefor the incredible work that they've done together to build a ministry where the fastest driverscan slow down a little bit, and spend some time in prayer and reflection and thanks.  And wecertainly want to wish Darrell a happy birthday. Happy birthday.
I will note, though, Darrell, when you were reading that list of things folks were saying aboutyou, I was thinking, well, you're a piker.  I mean, that --  I mean, if you really want a list,come talk to me. Because that ain't nothing. That's the best they can do in NASCAR?
Slowing down and pausing for fellowship and prayer -- that's what this breakfast is about.  Ithink it's fair to say Washington moves a lot slower than NASCAR.  Certainly my agenda doessometimes. But still, it's easier to get caught up in the rush of our lives, and in the politicalback-and-forth that can take over this city.  We get sidetracked with distractions, large andsmall.  We can't go 10 minutes without checking our smartphones -- and for my staff, that'severy 10 seconds.  And so for 63 years, this prayer tradition has brought us together, givingus the opportunity to come together in humility before the Almighty and to be reminded ofwhat it is that we share as children of God.
And certainly for me, this is always a chance to reflect on my own faith journey.  Many timesas President, I've been reminded of a line of prayer that Eleanor Roosevelt was fond of. Shesaid, "Keep us at tasks too hard for us that we may be driven to Thee for strength."  Keep usat tasks too hard for us that we may be driven to Thee for strength.  I've wondered at times ifmaybe God was answering that prayer a little too literally.  But no matter the challenge, Hehas been there for all of us.  He's certainly strengthened me "with the power through hisSpirit," as I've sought His guidance not just in my own life but in the life of our nation.
Now, over the last few months, we've seen a number of challenges -- certainly over the lastsix years.  But part of what I want to touch on today is the degree to which we've seenprofessions of faith used both as an instrument of great good, but also twisted and misused inthe name of evil.
As we speak, around the world, we see faith inspiring people to lift up one another -- to feedthe hungry and care for the poor, and comfort the afflicted and make peace where there isstrife.  We heard the good work that Sister has done in Philadelphia, and the incredible workthat Dr. [Kent] Brantly and his colleagues have done.  We see faith driving us to do right.
But we also see faith being twisted and distorted, used as a wedge -- or, worse, sometimesused as a weapon.  From a school in Pakistan to the streets of Paris, we have seen violenceand terror perpetrated by those who profess to stand up for faith, their faith, professed tostand up for Islam, but, in fact, are betraying it.  We see ISIL, a brutal, vicious death cultthat, in the name of religion, carries out unspeakable acts of barbarism  -- terrorizing religiousminorities like the Yazidis, subjecting women to rape as a weapon of war, and claiming themantle of religious authority for such actions. 
  
We see sectarian war in Syria, the murder of Muslims and Christians in Nigeria, religious warin the Central African Republic, a rising tide of anti-Semitism and hate crimes in Europe, sooften perpetrated in the name of religion.
So how do we, as people of faith, reconcile these realities -- the profound good, the strength,the tenacity, the compassion and love that can flow from all of our faiths, operating alongsidethose who seek to hijack religious for their own murderous ends? 
Humanity has been grappling with these questions throughout human history.  And lest weget on our high horse and think this is unique to some other place, remember that during theCrusades and the Inquisition, people committed terrible deeds in the name of Christ.  In ourhome country, slavery and Jim Crow all too often was justified in the name of Christ.  Michelleand I returned from India -- an incredible, beautiful country, full of magnificent diversity --but a place where, in past years, religious faiths of all types have, on occasion, been targetedby other peoples of faith, simply due to their heritage and their beliefs -- acts of intolerancethat would have shocked Gandhiji, the person who helped to liberate that nation. 
So this is not unique to one group or one religion.  There is a tendency in us, a sinful tendencythat can pervert and distort our faith.  In today's world, when hate groups have their ownTwitter accounts and bigotry can fester in hidden places in cyberspace, it can be even harderto counteract such intolerance. But God compels us to try.  And in this mission, I believe thereare a few principles that can guide us, particularly those of us who profess to believe. 
And, first, we should start with some basic humility.  I believe that the starting point of faith issome doubt -- not being so full of yourself and so confident that you are right and that Godspeaks only to us, and doesn't speak to others, that God only cares about us and doesn't careabout others, that somehow we alone are in possession of the truth.
Our job is not to ask that God respond to our notion of Truth -- our job is to be true to Him,His word, and His commandments.  And we should assume humbly that we're confused anddon't always know what we're doing and we're staggering and stumbling towards Him, andhave some humility in that process.  And that means we have to speak up against those whowould misuse His name to justify oppression, or violence, or hatred with that fierce certainty. No God condones terror.  No grievance justifies the taking of innocent lives, or the oppressionof those who are weaker or fewer in number.
And so, as people of faith, we are summoned to push back against those who try to distortour religion -- any religion -- for their own nihilistic ends.  And here at home and around theworld, we will constantly reaffirm that fundamental freedom -- freedom of religion -- the rightto practice our faith how we choose, to change our faith if we choose, to practice no faith atall if we choose, and to do so free of persecution and fear and discrimination.
  
There's wisdom in our founders writing in those documents that help found this nation thenotion of freedom of religion, because they understood the need for humility.  They alsounderstood the need to uphold freedom of speech, that there was a connection betweenfreedom of speech and freedom of religion.  For to infringe on one right under the pretext ofprotecting another is a betrayal of both.
But part of humility is also recognizing in modern, complicated, diverse societies, thefunctioning of these rights, the concern for the protection of these rights calls for each of us toexercise civility and restraint and judgment.  And if, in fact, we defend the legal right of aperson to insult another's religion, we're equally obligated to use our free speech to condemnsuch insults -- and stand shoulder-to-shoulder with religious communities, particularlyreligious minorities who are the targets of such attacks.  Just because you have the right tosay something doesn't mean the rest of us shouldn't question those who would insult others inthe name of free speech.  Because we know that our nations are stronger when people of allfaiths feel that they are welcome, that they, too, are full and equal members of our countries.
So humility I think is needed.  And the second thing we need is to uphold the distinctionbetween our faith and our governments: between Church and between State.  The UnitedStates is one of the most religious countries in the world -- far more religious than mostWestern developed countries.  And one of the reasons is that our founders wisely embracedthe separation of church and state.  Our government does not sponsor a religion, nor does itpressure anyone to practice a particular faith, or any faith at all.  And the result is a culturewhere people of all backgrounds and beliefs can freely and proudly worship, without fear, orcoercion -- so that when you listen to Darrell talk about his faith journey you know it's real. You know he's not saying it because it helps him advance, or because somebody told him to. It's from the heart. 
That's not the case in theocracies that restrict people's choice of faith.  It's not the case inauthoritarian governments that elevate an individual leader or a political party above thepeople, or in some cases, above the concept of God Himself.  So the freedom of religion is avalue we will continue to protect here at home and stand up for around the world, and is onethat we guard vigilantly here in the United States.
Last year, we joined together to pray for the release of Christian missionary Kenneth Bae,held in North Korea for two years.  And today, we give thanks that Kenneth is finally backwhere he belongs -- home, with his family. 
Last year, we prayed together for Pastor Saeed Abedini, detained in Iran since 2012.  And Iwas recently in Boise, Idaho, and had the opportunity to meet with Pastor Abedini's beautifulwife and wonderful children and to convey to them that our country has not forgotten brotherSaeed and that we're doing everything we can to bring him home. And then, I received anextraordinary letter from Pastor Abedini.  And in it, he describes his captivity, and expressedhis gratitude for my visit with his family, and thanked us all for standing in solidarity with himduring his captivity.
  
And Pastor Abedini wrote, 
Nothing is more valuable to the Body of Christ than to see how the Lord is in control,and moves ahead of countries and leadership through united prayer.
And he closed his letter by describing himself as [a]
prisoner for Christ, who is proud to be part of this great nation of the United States ofAmerica that cares for religious freedom around the world. 
We're going to keep up this work -- for Pastor Abedini and all those around the world who areunjustly held or persecuted because of their faith. And we're grateful to our new Ambassador-
at-Large for International Religious Freedom, Rabbi David Saperstein -- who has hit theground running, and is heading to Iraq in a few days to help religious communities thereaddress some of those challenges.  Where's David?  I know he's here somewhere.  Thank you,David, for the great work you're doing. 
Humility; a suspicion of government getting between us and our faiths, or trying to dictate ourfaiths, or elevate one faith over another.  And, finally, let's remember that if there is one lawthat we can all be most certain of that seems to bind people of all faiths, and people who arestill finding their way towards faith but have a sense of ethics and morality in them -- that onelaw, that Golden Rule that we should treat one another as we wish to be treated.  The Torahsays "Love thy neighbor as yourself."  In Islam, there is a Hadith that states: "None of youtruly believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself."  The Holy Bible tells usto "put on love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony."  Put on love.
Whatever our beliefs, whatever our traditions, we must seek to be instruments of peace, andbringing light where there is darkness, and sowing love where there is hatred.  And this is theloving message of His Holiness, Pope Francis.  And like so many people around the world, I'vebeen touched by his call to relieve suffering, and to show justice and mercy and compassionto the most vulnerable; to walk with The Lord and ask "Who am I to judge?"  He challenges usto press on in what he calls our "march of living hope."  And like millions of Americans, I amvery much looking forward to welcoming Pope Francis to the United States later this year. 
His Holiness expresses that basic law:  Treat thy neighbor as yourself.  The Dalai Lama --anybody who's had an opportunity to be with him senses that same spirit.  Kent Brantlyexpresses that same spirit.  Kent was with Samaritan's Purse, treating Ebola patients inLiberia, when he contracted the virus himself. And with world-class medical care and a deepreliance on faith -- with God's help, Kent survived.  
And then by donating his plasma, he helped others survive as well.  And he continues toadvocate for a global response in West Africa, reminding us that "our efforts needs to be onloving the people there."  And I could not have been prouder to welcome Kent and hiswonderful wife Amber to the Oval Office.
  
We are blessed to have him here today -- because he reminds us of what it means to really"love thy neighbor as thyself."  Not just words, but deeds. 
Each of us has a role in fulfilling our common, greater purpose -- not merely to seek highposition, but to plumb greater depths so that we may find the strength to love more fully. And this is perhaps our greatest challenge -- to see our own reflection in each other; to be ourbrother's keepers and sister's keepers, and to keep faith with one another.  As children ofGod, let's make that our work, together.
As children of God, let's work to end injustice -- injustice of poverty and hunger.  No oneshould ever suffer from such want amidst such plenty.  As children of God, let's work toeliminate the scourge of homelessness, because, as Sister Mary [Scullion] says, "None of usare home until all of us are home."  None of us are home until all of us are home.
As children of God, let's stand up for the dignity and value of every woman, and man, andchild, because we are all equal in His eyes, and work to send the scourge and the sin ofmodern-day slavery and human trafficking, and "set the oppressed free." 
If we are properly humble, if we drop to our knees on occasion, we will acknowledge that wenever fully know God's purpose.  We can never fully fathom His amazing grace.  "We seethrough a glass, darkly" -- grappling with the expanse of His awesome love.  But even withour limits, we can heed that which is required:  "To do justice, and love kindness, and walkhumbly with our God."
I pray that we will.  And as we journey together on this "march of living hope," I pray that, inHis Name, we will run and not be weary, and walk and not be faint, and we'll heed thosewords and "put on love." 
May the Lord bless you and keep you, and may He bless this precious country that we love. 
Thank you all very much.
