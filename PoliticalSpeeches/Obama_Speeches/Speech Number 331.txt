This morning, I want to express our grief and condolences to the families of two hostages. One American, Dr. Warren Weinstein, and an Italian, Giovanni Lo Porto, who were tragicallykilled in a U.S. counterterrorism operation.
Warren and Giovanni were aid workers in Pakistan devoted to improving the lives of thePakistani people.  After Warren was abducted by al Qaeda in 2011, I directed my nationalsecurity team to do everything possible to find him and to bring him home safely to hisfamily.  And dedicated professionals across our government worked tirelessly to do so.  Wealso worked closely with our Italian allies on behalf of Giovanni, who was kidnapped in 2012.
Since 9/11, our counterterrorism efforts have prevented terrorist attacks and saved innocentlives both here in America, and around the world.  And that determination to protect innocentlife only makes the loss of these two men especially painful for all of us.  Based on informationand intelligence we have obtained, we believe that a U.S. counterterrorism operation targetingan al Qaeda compound in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region accidently killed Warren andGiovanni this past January.
Yesterday, I spoke with Warren’s wife Elaine and Prime Minister Renzi of Italy.  As a husbandand as a father, I cannot begin to imagine the anguish that the Weinstein and Lo Portofamilies are enduring today.  I realize that there are no words that can ever equal their loss.  Iknow that there is nothing that I can ever say or do to ease their heartache.
  
And today, I simply want to say this:
As President and as Commander-in-Chief, I take full responsibility for all our counterterrorismoperations, including the one that inadvertently took the lives of Warren and Giovanni.  Iprofoundly regret what happened.  On behalf of the United States government, I offer ourdeepest apologies to the families.
As soon as we determined the cause of their deaths, I directed that the existence of thisoperation be declassified and disclosed publicly.  I did so because the Weinstein and Lo Portofamilies deserve to know the truth.  And I did so because even as certain aspects of ournational security efforts have to remain secret in order to succeed, the United States is ademocracy committed to openness in good times and in bad.
Our initial assessment indicates that this operation was fully consistent with the guidelinesunder which we conduct counterterrorism efforts in the region, which has been our focus foryears because it is the home of al Qaeda’s leadership.  And based on the intelligence that wehad obtained at the time, including hundreds of hours of surveillance, we believed that thiswas an al Qaeda compound; that no civilians were present; and that capturing these terroristswas not possible.  And we do believe that the operation did take out dangerous members of alQaeda.  What we did not know, tragically, is that al Qaeda was hiding the presence of Warrenand Giovanni in this same compound.
It is a cruel and bitter truth that in the fog of war generally and our fight against terroristsspecifically, mistakes  -- sometimes deadly mistakes  -- can occur.  But one of the things thatsets America apart from many other nations, one of the things that makes us exceptional isour willingness to confront squarely our imperfections and to learn from our mistakes.
Already, I have directed a full review of what happened.  We will identify the lessons that canbe learned from this tragedy, and any changes that should be made.  We will do our utmost toensure it is not repeated.  And we will continue to do everything we can to prevent the loss ofinnocent lives  -- not just innocent Americans, but all innocent lives in our counterterrorismoperations.
Today we join their families and friends in honoring Warren and Giovanni  -- twohumanitarians who came from different countries but who were united by a spirit of service. For decades, Warren lived the ideals of our country, serving with the Peace Corps and laterwith the United States Agency for International Development.  He devoted his life to peopleacross Africa and South Asia.  He was a loving husband, father and grandfather who willinglyleft the comforts of home to help the people of Pakistan.  At the time of his abduction, he wasa USAID contractor focused on helping Pakistani families escape poverty and give a better lifeto their children.
  
Giovanni’s humanitarianism also took him around the world to the Central African Republic, toHaiti and ultimately Pakistan.  Like Warren, he fell in love with Pakistan and its people, andbelieved passionately that he could made a difference in their lives.  Giovanni’s servicereflected the commitment of the Italian people, our great allies and friends, to the securityand dignity of people around the world.  And today is a reminder of the bonds of friendshipbetween our countries and the shared values that bind Americans and Italians together.
There could be no starker contrast between these two selfless men and their al Qaedacaptors.  Warren’s work benefited people across faiths.  Meanwhile, al Qaeda boasted to theworld that it held Warren, citing his Jewish faith.  Al Qaeda held both men for years, even asWarren’s health deteriorated.  They deprived these men of precious, irreplaceable years withfamily who missed them terribly.
Amid grief that is unimaginable, I pray that these two families will find some small measure ofsolace in knowing that Warren and Giovanni’s legacy will endure.  Their service will beremembered by the Pakistani men, women and children whose lives they touched and madebetter.  Their spirit will live on in the love of their families, who are in our thoughts andprayers today, especially Warren’s wife Elaine, their daughters Alisa and Jennifer, and theirfamilies.
And the shining example of these two men will stand as a light to people the world over whosee suffering and answer with compassion, who see hatred and offer their love, who see warand work for peace. 
May God bless these two brave men, and may He watch over and comfort their families for allthe years to come.
