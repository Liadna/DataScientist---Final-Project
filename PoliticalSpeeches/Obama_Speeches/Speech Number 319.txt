Good afternoon.  Today, as part of an international coalition of some 60 nations -- includingArab countries -- our men and women in uniform continue the fight against ISIL in Iraq and inSyria.
More than 2,000 coalition airstrikes have pounded these terrorists.  We’re disrupting theircommand and control and supply lines, making it harder for them to move.  We’re destroyingtheir fighting positions, their tanks, their vehicles, their barracks, their training camps, andthe oil and gas facilities and infrastructure that fund their operations.  We’re taking out theircommanders, their fighters, and their leaders.
In Iraq, local forces have largely held the line and in some places have pushed ISIL back.  InSyria, ISIL failed in its major push to take the town of Kobani, losing countless fighters in theprocess -- fighters who will never again threaten innocent civilians.  And we’ve seen reports ofsinking morale among ISIL fighters as they realize the futility of their cause.
Now, make no mistake -- this is a difficult mission, and it will remain difficult for some time. It’s going to take time to dislodge these terrorists, especially from urban areas.  But ourcoalition is on the offensive, ISIL is on the defensive, and ISIL is going to lose.  Its barbaricmurders of so many people, including American hostages, are a desperate and revoltingattempt to strike fear in the hearts of people it can never possibly win over by its ideas or itsideology -- because it offers nothing but misery and death and destruction.  And with vilegroups like this, there is only one option:  With our allies and partners, we are going todegrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group.
  
And when I announced our strategy against ISIL in September, I said that we are strongest asa nation when the President and Congress work together.  Today, my administrationsubmitted a draft resolution to Congress to authorize the use of force against ISIL.  I want tobe very clear about what it does and what it does not do.
This resolution reflects our core objective to destroy ISIL.  It supports the comprehensivestrategy that we have been pursuing with our allies and partners:  A systemic and sustainedcampaign of airstrikes against ISIL in Iraq and Syria.  Support and training for local forces onthe ground, including the moderate Syrian opposition.  Preventing ISIL attacks, in the regionand beyond, including by foreign terrorist fighters who try to threaten our countries.  Regionaland international support for an inclusive Iraqi government that unites the Iraqi people andstrengthens Iraqi forces against ISIL.  Humanitarian assistance for the innocent civilians ofIraq and Syria, who are suffering so terribly under ISIL’s reign of horror.
I want to thank Vice President Biden, Secretaries Kerry and Hagel, and General MartyDempsey for their leadership in advancing our strategy.  Even as we meet this challenge inIraq and Syria, we all agree that one of our weapons against terrorists like ISIL -- a criticalpart of our strategy -- is the values we live here at home.  One of the best antidotes to thehateful ideologies that try to recruit and radicalize people to violent extremism is our ownexample as diverse and tolerant societies that welcome the contributions of all people,including people of all faiths.
The resolution we’ve submitted today does not call for the deployment of U.S. ground combatforces to Iraq or Syria.  It is not the authorization of another ground war, like Afghanistan orIraq.  The 2,600 American troops in Iraq today largely serve on bases -- and, yes, they facethe risks that come with service in any dangerous environment.  But they do not have acombat mission.  They are focused on training Iraqi forces, including Kurdish forces.
As I’ve said before, I’m convinced that the United States should not get dragged back intoanother prolonged ground war in the Middle East.  That’s not in our national security interestand it’s not necessary for us to defeat ISIL.  Local forces on the ground who know theircountries best are best positioned to take the ground fight to ISIL -- and that’s what they’redoing.
At the same time, this resolution strikes the necessary balance by giving us the flexibility weneed for unforeseen circumstances.  For example, if we had actionable intelligence about agathering of ISIL leaders, and our partners didn’t have the capacity to get them, I would beprepared to order our Special Forces to take action, because I will not allow these terrorists tohave a safe haven.  So we need flexibility, but we also have to be careful and deliberate.  Andthere is no heavier decision than asking our men and women in uniform to risk their lives onour behalf.  As Commander in Chief, I will only send our troops into harm’s way when it isabsolutely necessary for our national security.
  
Finally, this resolution repeals the 2002 authorization of force for the invasion of Iraq andlimits this new authorization to three years.  I do not believe America’s interests are served byendless war, or by remaining on a perpetual war footing.  As a nation, we need to ask thedifficult and necessary questions about when, why and how we use military force.  After all, itis our troops who bear the costs of our decisions, and we owe them a clear strategy and thesupport they need to get the job done.  So this resolution will give our armed forces and ourcoalition the continuity we need for the next three years.
It is not a timetable.  It is not announcing that the mission is completed at any given period. What it is saying is that Congress should revisit the issue at the beginning of the nextPresident’s term.  It’s conceivable that the mission is completed earlier.  It’s conceivable thatafter deliberation, debate and evaluation, that there are additional tasks to be carried out inthis area.  And the people’s representatives, with a new President, should be able to have thatdiscussion.
In closing, I want to say that in crafting this resolution we have consulted with, and listenedto, both Republicans and Democrats in Congress.  We have made a sincere effort to addressdifficult issues that we’ve discussed together.  In the days and weeks ahead, we’ll continue towork closely with leaders and members of Congress on both sides of the aisle.  I believe thisresolution can grow even stronger with the thoughtful and dignified debate that this momentdemands.  I’m optimistic that it can win strong bipartisan support, and that we can show ourtroops and the world that Americans are united in this mission.
Today, our men and women in uniform continue the fight against ISIL, and we salute them fortheir courageous service.  We pray for their safety.  We stand with their families who missthem and who are sacrificing here at home.  But know this:  Our coalition is strong, our causeis just, and our mission will succeed.  And long after the terrorists we face today aredestroyed and forgotten, America will continue to stand free and tall and strong.
May God bless our troops, and may God bless the United States of America.
Thank you very much, everybody.
