Well, thank you, Lisa, for the introduction.  Lisa is an example of the countless dedicatedpublic servants across our government, a number of who are here today, who are workingtirelessly every single day on behalf of the security and safety of the American people.  So wevery much appreciate her.  And thanks to all of you for your attendance and participation inthis important summit.
For more than 238 years, the United States of America has not just endured, but we havethrived and surmounted challenges that might have broken a lesser nation.  After a terriblecivil war, we repaired our union.  We weathered a Great Depression, became the world’s mostdynamic economy.  We fought fascism, liberated Europe.  We faced down communism -- andwon.  American communities have been destroyed by earthquakes and tornadoes and firesand floods -- and each time we rebuild.
The bombing that killed 168 people could not break Oklahoma City.  On 9/11, terrorists triedto bring us to our knees; today a new tower soars above New York City, and Americacontinues to lead throughout the world.  After Americans were killed at Fort Hood and theBoston Marathon, it didn’t divide us; we came together as one American family.
In the face of horrific acts of violence -- at a Sikh temple near Milwaukee, or at a Jewishcommunity center outside Kansas City -- we reaffirmed our commitment to pluralism and tofreedom, repulsed by the notion that anyone should ever be targeted because of who theyare, or what they look like, or how they worship.
  
Most recently, with the brutal murders in Chapel Hill of three young Muslim Americans, manyMuslim Americans are worried and afraid.  And I want to be as clear as I can be:  AsAmericans, all faiths and backgrounds, we stand with you in your grief and we offer our loveand we offer our support.
My point is this:  As Americans, we are strong and we are resilient.  And when tragedy strikes,when we take a hit, we pull together, and we draw on what’s best in our character -- ouroptimism, our commitment to each other, our commitment to our values, our respect for oneanother.  We stand up, and we rebuild, and we recover, and we emerge stronger than before. That’s who we are.
And I say all this because we face genuine challenges to our security today, just as we havethroughout our history.  Challenges to our security are not new.  They didn’t happenyesterday or a week ago or a year ago.  We've always faced challenges.  One of thosechallenges is the terrorist threat from groups like al Qaeda and ISIL.  But this isn't ourchallenge alone.  It's a challenge for the world.  ISIL is terrorizing the people of Syria andIraq, beheads and burns human beings in unfathomable acts of cruelty.  We’ve seen deadlyattacks in Ottawa and Sydney and, Paris, and now Copenhagen.
So, in the face of this challenge, we have marshaled the full force of the United Statesgovernment, and we’re working with allies and partners to dismantle terrorist organizationsand protect the American people.  Given the complexities of the challenge and the nature ofthe enemy -- which is not a traditional army -- this work takes time, and will require vigilanceand resilience and perspective.  But I'm confident that, just as we have for more than twocenturies, we will ultimately prevail.
And part of what gives me that confidence is the overwhelming response of the worldcommunity to the savagery of these terrorists -- not just revulsion, but a concretecommitment to work together to vanquish these organizations.
At the United Nations in September, I called on the international community to come togetherand eradicate this scourge of violent extremism.  And I want to thank all of you -- from acrossAmerica and around the world -- for answering this call.  Tomorrow at the State Department,governments and civil society groups from more than 60 countries will focus on the steps thatwe can take as governments.  And I’ll also speak about how our nations have to remainrelentless in our fight -- our counterterrorism efforts -- against groups that are plottingagainst our counties.
But we are here today because of a very specific challenge -- and that’s countering violentextremism, something that is not just a matter of military affairs.  By "violent extremism," wedon’t just mean the terrorists who are killing innocent people.  We also mean the ideologies,the infrastructure of extremists --the propagandists, the recruiters, the funders who radicalizeand recruit or incite people to violence.  We all know there is no one profile of a violentextremist or terrorist, so there’s no way to predict who will become radicalized.
  
Around the world, and here in the United States, inexcusable acts of violence have beencommitted against people of different faiths, by people of different faiths -- which is, ofcourse, a betrayal of all our faiths.  It's not unique to one group, or to one geography, or oneperiod of time.
But we are here at this summit because of the urgent threat from groups like al Qaeda andISIL.  And this week we are focused on prevention -- preventing these groups fromradicalizing, recruiting or inspiring others to violence in the first place.  I’ve called upongovernments to come to the United Nations this fall with concrete steps that we can taketogether.  And today, what I want to do is suggest several areas where I believe we canconcentrate our efforts.
First, we have to confront squarely and honestly the twisted ideologies that these terroristgroups use to incite people to violence.  Leading up to this summit, there’s been a fair amountof debate in the press and among pundits about the words we use to describe and frame thischallenge.  So I want to be very clear about how I see it.
Al Qaeda and ISIL and groups like it are desperate for legitimacy.  They try to portraythemselves as religious leaders -- holy warriors in defense of Islam.  That’s why ISILpresumes to declare itself the "Islamic State."  And they propagate the notion that America --and the West, generally -- is at war with Islam.  That’s how they recruit.  That’s how they tryto radicalize young people.  We must never accept the premise that they put forward, becauseit is a lie.  Nor should we grant these terrorists the religious legitimacy that they seek.  Theyare not religious leaders -- they’re terrorists.  And we are not at war with Islam.  We are atwar with people who have perverted Islam.
Now, just as those of us outside Muslim communities need to reject the terrorist narrative thatthe West and Islam are in conflict, or modern life and Islam are in conflict, I also believe thatMuslim communities have a responsibility as well.  Al Qaeda and ISIL do draw, selectively,from the Islamic texts.  They do depend upon the misperception around the world that theyspeak in some fashion for people of the Muslim faith, that Islam is somehow inherentlyviolent, that there is some sort of clash of civilizations.
Of course, the terrorists do not speak for over a billion Muslims who reject their hatefulideology.  They no more represent Islam than any madman who kills innocents in the name ofGod represents Christianity or Judaism or Buddhism or Hinduism.  No religion is responsiblefor terrorism.  People are responsible for violence and terrorism.
And to their credit, there are respected Muslim clerics and scholars not just here in the UnitedStates but around the world who push back on this twisted interpretation of their faith.  Theywant to make very clear what Islam stands for.  And we’re joined by some of these leaderstoday.
  
These religious leaders and scholars preach that Islam calls for peace and for justice, andtolerance toward others; that terrorism is prohibited; that the Koran says whoever kills aninnocent, it is as if he has killed all mankind.  Those are the voices that represent over abillion people around the world.
But if we are going to effectively isolate terrorists, if we're going to address the challenge oftheir efforts to recruit our young people, if we're going to lift up the voices of tolerance andpluralism within the Muslim community, then we've got to acknowledge that their job is madeharder by a broader narrative that does exist in many Muslim communities around the worldthat suggests the West is at odds with Islam in some fashion.
The reality -- which, again, many Muslim leaders have spoken to -- is that there’s a strain ofthought that doesn’t embrace ISIL’s tactics, doesn’t embrace violence, but does buy into thenotion that the Muslim world has suffered historical grievances  -- sometimes that's accurate -
- does buy into the belief that so many of the ills in the Middle East flow from a history ofcolonialism or conspiracy; does buy into the idea that Islam is incompatible with modernity ortolerance, or that it's been polluted by Western values.
So those beliefs exist.  In some communities around the world they are widespread.  And so itmakes individuals -- especially young people who already may be disaffected or alienated --more ripe for radicalization.  And so we've got to be able to talk honestly about those issues. We've got to be much more clear about how we're rejecting certain ideas.
So just as leaders like myself reject the notion that terrorists like ISIL genuinely representIslam, Muslim leaders need to do more to discredit the notion that our nations are determinedto suppress Islam, that there’s an inherent clash in civilizations.  Everybody has to speak upvery clearly that no matter what the grievance, violence against innocents doesn't defendIslam or Muslims, it damages Islam and Muslims.
And when all of us, together, are doing our part to reject the narratives of violent extremists,when all of us are doing our part to be very clear about the fact that there are certainuniversal precepts and values that need to be respected in this interconnected world, that’sthe beginnings of a partnership.
As we go forward, we need to find new ways to amplify the voices of peace and tolerance andinclusion -- and we especially need to do it online.  We also need to lift up the voices of thosewho know the hypocrisy of groups like ISIL firsthand, including former extremists.  Theirwords speak to us today.  And I know in some of the discussions these voices have beenraised: "I witnessed horrible crimes committed by ISIS."  "It’s not a revolution or jihad…it’s aslaughter…I was shocked by what I did."  "This isn’t what we came for, to kill other Muslims." "I’m 28 -- is this the only future I’m able to imagine?"  That's the voice of so many who weretemporarily radicalized and then saw the truth.  And they’ve warned other young people notto make the same mistakes as they did.  "Do not run after illusions."  "Do not be deceived." "Do not give up your life for nothing."  We need to lift up those voices.
  
And in all this work, the greatest resource are communities themselves, especially like thoseyoung people who are here today.  We are joined by talented young men and women who arepioneering new innovations, and new social media tools, and new ways to reach youngpeople.  We’re joined by leaders from the private sector, including high-tech companies, whowant to support your efforts.  And I want to challenge all of us to build new partnerships thatunleash the talents and creativity of young people -- young Muslims -- not just to expose thelies of extremists but to empower youth to service, and to lift up people’s lives here inAmerica and around the world.  And that can be a calling for your generation.
So that’s the first challenge -- we've got to discredit these ideologies.  We have to tackle themhead on.  And we can't shy away from these discussions.  And too often, folks are,understandably, sensitive about addressing some of these root issues, but we have to talkabout them, honestly and clearly.  And the reason I believe we have to do so is because I'mso confident that when the truth is out we'll be successful.     Now, a second challenge is wedo have to address the grievances that terrorists exploit, including economic grievances. Poverty alone does not cause a person to become a terrorist, any more than poverty alonecauses somebody to become a criminal.  There are millions of people -- billions of people  -- inthe world who live in abject poverty and are focused on what they can do to build up theirown lives, and never embrace violent ideologies.
Conversely, there are terrorists who’ve come from extraordinarily wealthy backgrounds, likeOsama bin Laden.  What’s true, though, is that when millions of people -- especially youth --are impoverished and have no hope for the future, when corruption inflicts daily humiliationson people, when there are no outlets by which people can express their concerns,resentments fester.  The risk of instability and extremism grow.  Where young people have noeducation, they are more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and radical ideas, because it's nottested against anything else, they’ve got nothing to weigh.  And we've seen this across theMiddle East and North Africa.
And terrorist groups are all too happy to step into a void. They offer salaries to their footsoldiers so they can support their families.  Sometimes they offer social services -- schools,health clinics -- to do what local governments cannot or will not do.  They try to justify theirviolence in the name of fighting the injustice of corruption that steals from the people -- evenwhile those terrorist groups end up committing even worse abuses, like kidnapping andhuman trafficking.
So if we’re going to prevent people from being susceptible to the false promises of extremism,then the international community has to offer something better.  And the United Statesintends to do its part.  We will keep promoting development and growth that is broadlyshared, so more people can provide for their families.  We’ll keep leading a global effortagainst corruption, because the culture of the bribe has to be replaced by good governancethat doesn’t favor certain groups over others.
  
Countries have to truly invest in the education and skills and job training that ourextraordinary young people need.  And by the way, that's boys and girls, and men andwomen, because countries will not be truly successful if half their populations -- if their girlsand their women are denied opportunity.  And America will continue to forge new partnershipsin entrepreneurship and innovation, and science and technology, so young people fromMorocco to Malaysia can start new businesses and create more prosperity.
Just as we address economic grievances, we need to face a third challenge -- and that'saddressing the political grievances that are exploited by terrorists.  When governmentsoppress their people, deny human rights, stifle dissent, or marginalize ethnic and religiousgroups, or favor certain religious groups over others, it sows the seeds of extremism andviolence.  It makes those communities more vulnerable to recruitment.  Terrorist groups claimthat change can only come through violence.  And if peaceful change is impossible, that playsinto extremist propaganda.
So the essential ingredient to real and lasting stability and progress is not less democracy; it’smore democracy.  It’s institutions that uphold the rule of law and apply justice equally.  It’ssecurity forces and police that respect human rights and treat people with dignity.  It’s freespeech and strong civil societies where people can organize and assemble and advocate forpeaceful change.  It’s freedom of religion where all people can practice their faith without fearand intimidation.  All of this is part of countering violent extremism.
Fourth, we have to recognize that our best partners in all these efforts, the best people tohelp protect individuals from falling victim to extremist ideologies are their own communities,their own family members.  We have to be honest with ourselves.  Terrorist groups like alQaeda and ISIL deliberately target their propaganda in the hopes of reaching andbrainwashing young Muslims, especially those who may be disillusioned or wrestling with theiridentity.  That’s the truth.  The high-quality videos, the online magazines, the use of socialmedia, terrorist Twitter accounts -- it’s all designed to target today’s young people online, incyberspace.
And by the way, the older people here, as wise and respected as you may be, your stuff isoften boring -- compared to what they’re doing.  You're not connected.  And as aconsequence, you are not connecting.
So these terrorists are a threat, first and foremost, to the communities that they target, whichmeans communities have to take the lead in protecting themselves.  And that is true here inAmerica, as it's true anywhere else.  When someone starts getting radicalized, family andfriends are often the first to see that something has changed in their personality.  Teachersmay notice a student becoming withdrawn or struggling with his or her identity, and if theyintervene at that moment and offer support, that may make a difference.
  
Faith leaders may notice that someone is beginning to espouse violent interpretations ofreligion, and that’s a moment for possible intervention that allows them to think about theiractions and reflect on the meaning of their faith in a way that’s more consistent with peaceand justice.  Families and friends, coworkers, neighbors, faith leaders -- they want to reachout; they want to help save their loved ones and friends, and prevent them from taking awrong turn.
But communities don’t always know the signs to look for, or have the tools to intervene, orknow what works best.  And that’s where government can play a role -- if government isserving as a trusted partner.  And that’s where we also need to be honest.  I know someMuslim Americans have concerns about working with government, particularly lawenforcement.  And their reluctance is rooted in the objection to certain practices where MuslimAmericans feel they’ve been unfairly targeted.
So, in our work, we have to make sure that abuses stop, are not repeated, that we do notstigmatize entire communities.  Nobody should be profiled or put under a cloud of suspicionsimply because of their faith.  Engagement with communities can’t be a cover forsurveillance.  We can’t "securitize" our relationship with Muslim Americans -- dealing withthem solely through the prism of law enforcement. Because when we do, that only reinforcessuspicions, makes it harder for us to build the trust that we need to work together.
As part of this summit, we’re announcing that we’re going to increase our outreach tocommunities, including Muslim Americans. We’re going to step up our efforts to engage withpartners and raise awareness so more communities understand how to protect their lovedones from becoming radicalized.  We’ve got to devote more resources to these efforts.
And as government does more, communities are going to have to step up as well.  We need tobuild on the pilot programs that have been discussed at this summit already -- in Los Angeles,in Minneapolis, in Boston.  These are partnerships that bring people together in a spirit ofmutual respect and create more dialogue and more trust and more cooperation.  If we’regoing to solve these issues, then the people who are most targeted and potentially mostaffected -- Muslim Americans -- have to have a seat at the table where they can help shapeand strengthen these partnerships so that we’re all working together to help communities staysafe and strong and resilient.
And finally, we need to do what extremists and terrorists hope we will not do, and that is staytrue to the values that define us as free and diverse societies.  If extremists are peddling thenotion that Western countries are hostile to Muslims, then we need to show that we welcomepeople of all faiths. 
Here in America, Islam has been woven into the fabric of our country since its founding. Generations of Muslim immigrants came here and went to work as farmers and merchants andfactory workers, helped to lay railroads and build up America.
  
The first Islamic center in New York City was founded in the 1890s.  America’s first mosque --this was an interesting fact -- was in North Dakota.
Muslim Americans protect our communities as police officers and firefighters and firstresponders, and protect our nation by serving in uniform, and in our intelligence communities,and in homeland security.  And in cemeteries across our country, including at Arlington,Muslim American heroes rest in peace having given their lives in defense of all of us.
And of course that’s the story extremists and terrorists don’t want the world to know --Muslims succeeding and thriving in America.  Because when that truth is known, it exposestheir propaganda as the lie that it is.  It’s also a story that every American must never forget,because it reminds us all that hatred and bigotry and prejudice have no place in our country. It’s not just counterproductive; it doesn’t just aid terrorists; it’s wrong.  It’s contrary to whowe are.
I’m thinking of a little girl named Sabrina who last month sent me a Valentine’s Day card inthe shape of a heart.  It was the first Valentine I got. I got it from Sabrina before Malia andSasha and Michelle gave me one. So she’s 11 years old.  She’s in the 5th grade.  She’s ayoung Muslim American.  And she said in her Valentine, "I enjoy being an American."  Andwhen she grows up, she wants to be an engineer -- or a basketball player.  Which are goodchoices.  But she wrote, "I am worried about people hating Muslims…If some Muslims do badthings, that doesn’t mean all of them do."  And she asked, "Please tell everyone that we aregood people and we’re just like everyone else."  Now, those are the words -- and the wisdom-- of a little girl growing up here in America, just like my daughters are growing up here inAmerica.  "We’re just like everybody else."  And everybody needs to remember that duringthe course of this debate.
As we move forward with these challenges, we all have responsibilities, we all have hard workahead of us on this issue.  We can’t paper over problems, and we’re not going to solve this ifwe’re always just trying to be politically correct. But we do have to remember that 11-year-
old girl.  That’s our hope.  That’s our future.  That’s how we discredit violent ideologies, bymaking sure her voice is lifted up; making sure she’s nurtured; making sure that she’ssupported -- and then, recognizing there are little girls and boys like that all around the world,and us helping to address economic and political grievances that can be exploited byextremists, and empowering local communities, and us staying true to our values as a diverseand tolerant society even when we’re threatened -- especially when we’re threatened.
There will be a military component to this.  There are savage cruelties going on out there thathave to be stopped.  ISIL is killing Muslims at a rate that is many multiples the rate thatthey’re killing non-Muslims.  Everybody has a stake in stopping them, and there will be anelement of us just stopping them in their tracks with force. But to eliminate the soil out ofwhich they grew, to make sure that we are giving a brighter future to everyone and a lastingsense of security, then we're going to have to make it clear to all of our children -- including
  
that little girl in 5th grade -- that you have a place. You have a place here in America.  Youhave a place in those countries where you live.  You have a future.
Ultimately, those are the antidotes to violent extremism.  And that's work that we're going tohave to do together.  It will take time.  This is a generational challenge.  But after 238 years,it should be obvious -- America has overcome much bigger challenges, and we’ll overcome theones that we face today.  We will stay united and committed to the ideals that have shaped usfor more than two centuries, including the opportunity and justice and dignity of every singlehuman being.
Thank you very much, everybody.
