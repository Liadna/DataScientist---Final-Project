Thank you, so much. 
Vice President Biden, Mr. Chief Justice, members of the United States Congress, distinguished guests, andfellow citizens, each time we gather to inaugurate a president, we bear witness to the enduring strength ofour Constitution. We affirm the promise of our democracy. We recall that what binds this nation together isnot the colors of our skin or the tenets of our faith or the origins of our names. 
What makes us exceptional, what makes us America is our allegiance to an idea articulated in a declarationmade more than two centuries ago:
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed bytheir Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit ofHappiness.
Today we continue a never ending journey to bridge the meaning of those words with the realities of ourtime. For history tells us that while these truths may be self-evident, they’ve never been self-executing. Thatwhile freedom is a gift from God, it must be secured by his people here on earth.
The patriots of 1776 did not fight to replace the tyranny of a king with the privileges of a few, or the rule of amob. They gave to us a republic, a government of, and by, and for the people. Entrusting each generation tokeep safe our founding creed. And for more than 200 years we have. Through blood drawn by lash, andblood drawn by sword, we noted that no union founded on the principles of liberty and equality could survivehalf slave, and half free. We made ourselves anew, and vowed to move forward together.
 
 
Together we determined that a modern economy requires railroads and highways to speed travel andcommerce, schools and colleges to train our workers. Together we discovered that a free market onlythrives when there are rules to ensure competition and fair play. Together we resolve that a great nationmust care for the vulnerable and protect its people from life’s worst hazards and misfortune.
Through it all, we have never relinquished our skepticism of central authority, nor have we succumbed to thefiction that all societies ills can be cured through government alone. Our celebration of initiative andenterprise, our insistence on hard work and personal responsibility, these are constants in our character. 
But we have always understood that when times change, so must we; that fidelity to our founding principlesrequires new responses to new challenges; that preserving our individual freedoms ultimately requirescollective action. For the American people can no more meet the demands of today’s world by acting alonethan American soldiers could have met the forces of fascism or communism with muskets and militias. Nosingle person can train all the math and science teachers we’ll need to equip our children for the future, orbuild the roads and networks and research labs that will bring new jobs and businesses to our shores. Now,more than ever, we must do these things together, as one nation and one people.
This generation of Americans has been tested by crises that steeled our resolve and proved our resilience. A decade of war is now ending. An economic recovery has begun. America’s possibilities are limitless, forwe possess all the qualities that this world without boundaries demands:  youth and drive; diversity andopenness; an endless capacity for risk and a gift for reinvention. My fellow Americans, we are made for thismoment, and we will seize it -- so long as we seize it together.
For we, the people, understand that our country cannot succeed when a shrinking few do very well and agrowing many barely make it. We believe that America’s prosperity must rest upon the broad shoulders of arising middle class. We know that America thrives when every person can find independence and pride intheir work; when the wages of honest labor liberate families from the brink of hardship. We are true to ourcreed when a little girl born into the bleakest poverty knows that she has the same chance to succeed asanybody else, because she is an American; she is free, and she is equal, not just in the eyes of God butalso in our own.
We understand that outworn programs are inadequate to the needs of our time. So we must harness newideas and technology to remake our government, revamp our tax code, reform our schools, and empowerour citizens with the skills they need to work harder, learn more, reach higher. But while the means willchange, our purpose endures. A nation that rewards the effort and determination of every singleAmerican. That is what this moment requires. That is what will give real meaning to our creed.
We, the people, still believe that every citizen deserves a basic measure of security and dignity. We mustmake the hard choices to reduce the cost of health care and the size of our deficit. But we reject the beliefthat America must choose between caring for the generation that built this country and investing in thegeneration that will build its future. For we remember the lessons of our past, when twilight years were spentin poverty and parents of a child with a disability had nowhere to turn.
 
 
We do not believe that in this country freedom is reserved for the lucky, or happiness for the few. Werecognize that no matter how responsibly we live our lives, any one of us at any time may face a job loss, ora sudden illness, or a home swept away in a terrible storm. The commitments we make to each otherthrough Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security, these things do not sap our initiative, they strengthenus. They do not make us a nation of takers; they free us to take the risks that make this country great.
We, the people, still believe that our obligations as Americans are not just to ourselves, but to all posterity.We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our childrenand future generations. Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science, but none can avoid thedevastating impact of raging fires and crippling drought and more powerful storms.
The path towards sustainable energy sources will be long and sometimes difficult. But America cannot resistthis transition, we must lead it. We cannot cede to other nations the technology that will power new jobs andnew industries, we must claim its promise. That’s how we will maintain our economic vitality and our nationaltreasure -- our forests and waterways, our crop lands, and snow-capped peaks. That is how we willpreserve our planet, commanded to our care by God. That’s what will lend meaning to the creed our Fathersonce declared.
We, the people, still believe that enduring security and lasting peace do not require perpetual war. Ourbrave men and women in uniform, tempered by the flames of battle, are unmatched in skill and courage.Our citizens, seared by the memory of those we have lost, know too well the price that is paid for liberty.The knowledge of their sacrifice will keep us forever vigilant against those who would do us harm. But weare also heirs to those who won the peace and not just the war; who turned sworn enemies into the surestof friends -- and we must carry those lessons into this time as well.
We will defend our people and uphold our values through strength of arms and rule of law. We will show thecourage to try and resolve our differences with other nations peacefully -- not because we are naïve aboutthe dangers we face, but because engagement can more durably lift suspicion and fear.
America will remain the anchor of strong alliances in every corner of the globe. And we will renew thoseinstitutions that extend our capacity to manage crisis abroad, for no one has a greater stake in a peacefulworld than its most powerful nation. We will support democracy from Asia to Africa, from the Americas to theMiddle East, because our interests and our conscience compel us to act on behalf of those who long forfreedom. And we must be a source of hope to the poor, the sick, the marginalized, the victims of prejudice --not out of mere charity, but because peace in our time requires the constant advance of those principles thatour common creed describes: tolerance and opportunity, human dignity, and justice.
We, the people, declare today that the most evident of truths -- that all of us are created equal -- is the starthat guides us still; just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls, and Selma, and Stonewall; just as itguided all those men and women, sung and unsung, who left footprints along this great Mall, to hear apreacher say that we cannot walk alone; to hear a "King" proclaim that our individual freedom is inextricablybound to the freedom of every soul on Earth.
 
 
It is now our generation’s task to carry on what those pioneers began. For our journey is not complete untilour wives, our mothers and daughters can earn a living equal to their efforts.
Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law --for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.
Our journey is not complete until no citizen is forced to wait for hours to exercise the right to vote.
Our journey is not complete until we find a better way to welcome the striving, hopeful immigrants who stillsee America as a land of opportunity -- until bright young students and engineers are enlisted in ourworkforce rather than expelled from our country.
Our journey is not complete until all our children, from the streets of Detroit to the hills of Appalachia, to thequiet lanes of Newtown, know that they are cared for and cherished and always safe from harm.
That is our generation’s task: to make these words, these rights, these values of life and liberty and thepursuit of happiness real for every American. Being true to our founding documents does not require us toagree on every contour of life. It does not mean we all define liberty in exactly the same way or follow thesame precise path to happiness. Progress does not compel us to settle centuries-long debates about therole of government for all time, but it does require us to act in our time.
For now decisions are upon us and we cannot afford delay. We cannot mistake absolutism for principle, orsubstitute spectacle for politics, or treat name-calling as reasoned debate. We must act, knowing that ourwork will be imperfect. We must act, knowing that today’s victories will be only partial and that it will be up tothose who stand here in four years and 40 years and 400 years hence to advance the timeless spirit onceconferred to us in a spare Philadelphia hall.
My fellow Americans, the oath I have sworn before you today, like the one recited by others who serve inthis Capitol, was an oath to God and country, not party or faction. And we must faithfully execute that pledgeduring the duration of our service. But the words I spoke today are not so different from the oath that istaken each time a soldier signs up for duty or an immigrant realizes her dream. My oath is not so differentfrom the pledge we all make to the flag that waves above and that fills our hearts with pride.
They are the words of citizens and they represent our greatest hope. You and I, as citizens, have the powerto set this country’s course. You and I, as citizens, have the obligation to shape the debates of our time --not only with the votes we cast, but with the voices we lift in defense of our most ancient values andenduring ideals.
Let us, each of us, now embrace with solemn duty and awesome joy what is our lasting birthright. Withcommon effort and common purpose, with passion and dedication, let us answer the call of history and carryinto an uncertain future that precious light of freedom.
Thank you. God bless you.
And may He forever bless these United States of America.
