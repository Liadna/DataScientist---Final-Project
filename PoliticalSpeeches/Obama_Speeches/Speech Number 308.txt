Good afternoon.  Today, the United States of America is changing its relationship with thepeople of Cuba. In the most significant changes in our policy in more than fifty years, we will end an outdatedapproach that, for decades, has failed to advance our interests, and instead we will begin tonormalize relations between our two countries.  Through these changes, we intend to createmore opportunities for the American and Cuban people, and begin a new chapter among thenations of the Americas. There’s a complicated history between the United States and Cuba.  I was born in 1961 -- justover two years after Fidel Castro took power in Cuba, and just a few months after the Bay ofPigs invasion, which tried to overthrow his regime. Over the next several decades, therelationship between our countries played out against the backdrop of the Cold War, andAmerica’s steadfast opposition to communism.  We are separated by just over 90 miles. Butyear after year, an ideological and economic barrier hardened between our two countries. Meanwhile, the Cuban exile community in the United States made enormous contributions toour country -- in politics and business, culture and sports.  Like immigrants before, Cubanshelped remake America, even as they felt a painful yearning for the land and families they leftbehind.  All of this bound America and Cuba in a unique relationship, at once family and foe. Proudly, the United States has supported democracy and human rights in Cuba through thesefive decades. We have done so primarily through policies that aimed to isolate the island,preventing the most basic travel and commerce that Americans can enjoy anyplace else.
  
And though this policy has been rooted in the best of intentions, no other nation joins us inimposing these sanctions, and it has had little effect beyond providing the Cuban governmentwith a rationale for restrictions on its people.  Today, Cuba is still governed by the Castros andthe Communist Party that came to power half a century ago. Neither the American, nor Cuban people are well served by a rigid policy that is rooted inevents that took place before most of us were born.  Consider that for more than 35 years,we’ve had relations with China -- a far larger country also governed by a Communist Party. Nearly two decades ago, we reestablished relations with Vietnam, where we fought a war thatclaimed more Americans than any Cold War confrontation. That’s why -- when I came into office -- I promised to re-examine our Cuba policy.  As a start,we lifted restrictions for Cuban Americans to travel and send remittances to their families inCuba.  These changes, once controversial, now seem obvious. Cuban Americans have beenreunited with their families, and are the best possible ambassadors for our values.  Andthrough these exchanges, a younger generation of Cuban Americans has increasinglyquestioned an approach that does more to keep Cuba closed off from an interconnected world. While I have been prepared to take additional steps for some time, a major obstacle stood inour way -- the wrongful imprisonment, in Cuba, of a U.S. citizen and USAID sub-contractorAlan Gross for five years.  Over many months, my administration has held discussions withthe Cuban government about Alan’s case, and other aspects of our relationship.  His HolinessPope Francis issued a personal appeal to me, and to Cuba’s President Raul Castro, urging usto resolve Alan’s case, and to address Cuba’s interest in the release of three Cuban agentswho have been jailed in the United States for over 15 years. Today, Alan returned home -- reunited with his family at long last.  Alan was released by theCuban government on humanitarian grounds.  Separately, in exchange for the three Cubanagents, Cuba today released one of the most important intelligence agents that the UnitedStates has ever had in Cuba, and who has been imprisoned for nearly two decades.  This man,whose sacrifice has been known to only a few, provided America with the information thatallowed us to arrest the network of Cuban agents that included the men transferred to Cubatoday, as well as other spies in the United States.  This man is now safely on our shores.  Having recovered these two men who sacrificed for our country, I’m now taking steps to placethe interests of the people of both countries at the heart of our policy. First, I’ve instructed Secretary Kerry to immediately begin discussions with Cuba toreestablish diplomatic relations that have been severed since January of 1961.  Going forward,the United States will reestablish an embassy in Havana, and high-ranking officials will visitCuba. 
  
Where we can advance shared interests, we will -- on issues like health, migration,counterterrorism, drug trafficking and disaster response.  Indeed, we’ve seen the benefits ofcooperation between our countries before.  It was a Cuban, Carlos Finlay, who discovered thatmosquitoes carry yellow fever; his work helped Walter Reed fight it.  Cuba has sent hundredsof health care workers to Africa to fight Ebola, and I believe American and Cuban health careworkers should work side by side to stop the spread of this deadly disease. Now, where we disagree, we will raise those differences directly -- as we will continue to doon issues related to democracy and human rights in Cuba.  But I believe that we can do moreto support the Cuban people and promote our values through engagement.  After all, these 50years have shown that isolation has not worked.  It’s time for a new approach. Second, I’ve instructed Secretary Kerry to review Cuba’s designation as a State Sponsor ofTerrorism.  This review will be guided by the facts and the law.  Terrorism has changed in thelast several decades.  At a time when we are focused on threats from al Qaeda to ISIL, anation that meets our conditions and renounces the use of terrorism should not face thissanction. Third, we are taking steps to increase travel, commerce, and the flow of information to andfrom Cuba.  This is fundamentally about freedom and openness, and also expresses my beliefin the power of people-to-people engagement.  With the changes I’m announcing today, it willbe easier for Americans to travel to Cuba, and Americans will be able to use American creditand debit cards on the island.  Nobody represents America’s values better than the Americanpeople, and I believe this contact will ultimately do more to empower the Cuban people. I also believe that more resources should be able to reach the Cuban people.  So we’resignificantly increasing the amount of money that can be sent to Cuba, and removing limits onremittances that support humanitarian projects, the Cuban people, and the emerging Cubanprivate sector. I believe that American businesses should not be put at a disadvantage, and that increasedcommerce is good for Americans and for Cubans.  So we will facilitate authorized transactionsbetween the United States and Cuba.  U.S. financial institutions will be allowed to openaccounts at Cuban financial institutions.  And it will be easier for U.S. exporters to sell goodsin Cuba. I believe in the free flow of information.  Unfortunately, our sanctions on Cuba have deniedCubans access to technology that has empowered individuals around the globe.  So I’veauthorized increased telecommunications connections between the United States and Cuba. Businesses will be able to sell goods that enable Cubans to communicate with the UnitedStates and other countries.  
  
These are the steps that I can take as President to change this policy.  The embargo that’sbeen imposed for decades is now codified in legislation.  As these changes unfold, I lookforward to engaging Congress in an honest and serious debate about lifting the embargo.  Yesterday, I spoke with Raul Castro to finalize Alan Gross’s release and the exchange ofprisoners, and to describe how we will move forward.  I made clear my strong belief thatCuban society is constrained by restrictions on its citizens.  In addition to the return of AlanGross and the release of our intelligence agent, we welcome Cuba’s decision to release asubstantial number of prisoners whose cases were directly raised with the Cuban governmentby my team.  We welcome Cuba’s decision to provide more access to the Internet for itscitizens, and to continue increasing engagement with international institutions like the UnitedNations and the International Committee of the Red Cross that promote universal values. But I’m under no illusion about the continued barriers to freedom that remain for ordinaryCubans.  The United States believes that no Cubans should face harassment or arrest orbeatings simply because they’re exercising a universal right to have their voices heard, andwe will continue to support civil society there.  While Cuba has made reforms to graduallyopen up its economy, we continue to believe that Cuban workers should be free to formunions, just as their citizens should be free to participate in the political process. Moreover, given Cuba’s history, I expect it will continue to pursue foreign policies that will attimes be sharply at odds with American interests.  I do not expect the changes I amannouncing today to bring about a transformation of Cuban society overnight.  But I amconvinced that through a policy of engagement, we can more effectively stand up for ourvalues and help the Cuban people help themselves as they move into the 21st century. To those who oppose the steps I’m announcing today, let me say that I respect your passionand share your commitment to liberty and democracy.  The question is how we uphold thatcommitment.  I do not believe we can keep doing the same thing for over five decades andexpect a different result.  Moreover, it does not serve America’s interests, or the Cubanpeople, to try to push Cuba toward collapse.  Even if that worked -- and it hasn’t for 50 years-- we know from hard-earned experience that countries are more likely to enjoy lastingtransformation if their people are not subjected to chaos.  We are calling on Cuba to unleashthe potential of 11 million Cubans by ending unnecessary restrictions on their political, social,and economic activities.  In that spirit, we should not allow U.S. sanctions to add to theburden of Cuban citizens that we seek to help. To the Cuban people, America extends a hand of friendship.  Some of you have looked to usas a source of hope, and we will continue to shine a light of freedom.  Others have seen us asa former colonizer intent on controlling your future.  José Martí once said, “Liberty is the rightof every man to be honest.”  Today, I am being honest with you.  We can never erase thehistory between us, but we believe that you should be empowered to live with dignity andself-determination.  Cubans have a saying about daily life:  “No es facil” -- it’s not easy. Today, the United States wants to be a partner in making the lives of ordinary Cubans a littlebit easier, more free, more prosperous.
  
 To those who have supported these measures, I thank you for being partners in our efforts. In particular, I want to thank His Holiness Pope Francis, whose moral example shows us theimportance of pursuing the world as it should be, rather than simply settling for the world as itis; the government of Canada, which hosted our discussions with the Cuban government; anda bipartisan group of congressmen who have worked tirelessly for Alan Gross’s release, andfor a new approach to advancing our interests and values in Cuba. Finally, our shift in policy towards Cuba comes at a moment of renewed leadership in theAmericas.  This April, we are prepared to have Cuba join the other nations of the hemisphereat the Summit of the Americas.  But we will insist that civil society join us so that citizens, notjust leaders, are shaping our future.  And I call on all of my fellow leaders to give meaning tothe commitment to democracy and human rights at the heart of the Inter-American Charter. Let us leave behind the legacy of both colonization and communism, the tyranny of drugcartels, dictators and sham elections.  A future of greater peace, security and democraticdevelopment is possible if we work together -- not to maintain power, not to secure vestedinterest, but instead to advance the dreams of our citizens. My fellow Americans, the city of Miami is only 200 miles or so from Havana.  Countlessthousands of Cubans have come to Miami -- on planes and makeshift rafts; some with littlebut the shirt on their back and hope in their hearts.  Today, Miami is often referred to as thecapital of Latin America.  But it is also a profoundly American city -- a place that reminds usthat ideals matter more than the color of our skin, or the circumstances of our birth; ademonstration of what the Cuban people can achieve, and the openness of the United Statesto our family to the South.  Todos somos Americanos. Change is hard -- in our own lives, and in the lives of nations.  And change is even harderwhen we carry the heavy weight of history on our shoulders.  But today we are making thesechanges because it is the right thing to do.  Today, America chooses to cut loose the shacklesof the past so as to reach for a better future -- for the Cuban people, for the American people,for our entire hemisphere, and for the world. Thank you.  God bless you and God bless the United States of America.
