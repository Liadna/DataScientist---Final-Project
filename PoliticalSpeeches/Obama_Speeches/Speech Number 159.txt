Good evening. Nearly 10 years ago, America suffered the worst attack on our shores sincePearl Harbor. This mass murder was planned by Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda network inAfghanistan, and signaled a new threat to our security -- one in which the targets were nolonger soldiers on a battlefield, but innocent men, women and children going about their dailylives.
In the days that followed, our nation was united as we struck at al Qaeda and routed theTaliban in Afghanistan. Then, our focus shifted. A second war was launched in Iraq, and wespent enormous blood and treasure to support a new government there. By the time I tookoffice, the war in Afghanistan had entered its seventh year. But al Qaeda’s leaders hadescaped into Pakistan and were plotting new attacks, while the Taliban had regrouped andgone on the offensive. Without a new strategy and decisive action, our military commanderswarned that we could face a resurgent al Qaeda and a Taliban taking over large parts ofAfghanistan.
For this reason, in one of the most difficult decisions that I’ve made as President, I ordered anadditional 30,000 American troops into Afghanistan. When I announced this surge at WestPoint, we set clear objectives: to refocus on al Qaeda, to reverse the Taliban’s momentum,and train Afghan security forces to defend their own country. I also made it clear that ourcommitment would not be open-ended, and that we would begin to draw down our forces thisJuly.
  
Tonight, I can tell you that we are fulfilling that commitment. Thanks to our extraordinarymen and women in uniform, our civilian personnel, and our many coalition partners, we aremeeting our goals. As a result, starting next month, we will be able to remove 10,000 of ourtroops from Afghanistan by the end of this year, and we will bring home a total of 33,000troops by next summer, fully recovering the surge I announced at West Point. After this initialreduction, our troops will continue coming home at a steady pace as Afghan security forcesmove into the lead.  Our mission will change from combat to support.  By 2014, this processof transition will be complete, and the Afghan people will be responsible for their own security.
We’re starting this drawdown from a position of strength. Al Qaeda is under more pressurethan at any time since 9/11. Together with the Pakistanis, we have taken out more than halfof al Qaeda’s leadership.  And thanks to our intelligence professionals and Special Forces, wekilled Osama bin Laden, the only leader that al Qaeda had ever known. This was a victory forall who have served since 9/11. One soldier summed it up well. “The message,” he said, “iswe don’t forget. You will be held accountable, no matter how long it takes.” 
The information that we recovered from bin Laden’s compound shows al Qaeda underenormous strain. Bin Laden expressed concern that al Qaeda had been unable to effectivelyreplace senior terrorists that had been killed, and that al Qaeda has failed in its effort toportray America as a nation at war with Islam -- thereby draining more widespreadsupport. Al Qaeda remains dangerous, and we must be vigilant against attacks. But we haveput al Qaeda on a path to defeat, and we will not relent until the job is done.
In Afghanistan, we’ve inflicted serious losses on the Taliban and taken a number of itsstrongholds. Along with our surge, our allies also increased their commitments, which helpedstabilize more of the country. Afghan security forces have grown by over 100,000 troops, andin some provinces and municipalities we’ve already begun to transition responsibility forsecurity to the Afghan people. In the face of violence and intimidation, Afghans are fightingand dying for their country, establishing local police forces, opening markets and schools,creating new opportunities for women and girls, and trying to turn the page on decades ofwar.
Of course, huge challenges remain. This is the beginning -- but not the end -- of our effort towind down this war. We’ll have to do the hard work of keeping the gains that we’ve made,while we draw down our forces and transition responsibility for security to the Afghangovernment. And next May, in Chicago, we will host a summit with our NATO allies andpartners to shape the next phase of this transition.
We do know that peace cannot come to a land that has known so much war without a politicalsettlement. So as we strengthen the Afghan government and security forces, America will joininitiatives that reconcile the Afghan people, including the Taliban. Our position on these talksis clear: They must be led by the Afghan government, and those who want to be a part of apeaceful Afghanistan must break from al Qaeda, abandon violence, and abide by the Afghan
  
constitution. But, in part because of our military effort, we have reason to believe thatprogress can be made.
The goal that we seek is achievable, and can be expressed simply: no safe haven from whichal Qaeda or its affiliates can launch attacks against our homeland or our allies. We won't try tomake Afghanistan a perfect place. We will not police its streets or patrol its mountainsindefinitely. That is the responsibility of the Afghan government, which must step up its abilityto protect its people, and move from an economy shaped by war to one that can sustain alasting peace. What we can do, and will do, is build a partnership with the Afghan people thatendures –- one that ensures that we will be able to continue targeting terrorists andsupporting a sovereign Afghan government.
Of course, our efforts must also address terrorist safe havens in Pakistan. No country is moreendangered by the presence of violent extremists, which is why we will continue to pressPakistan to expand its participation in securing a more peaceful future for this war-tornregion. We'll work with the Pakistani government to root out the cancer of violent extremism,and we will insist that it keeps its commitments. For there should be no doubt that so long asI am President, the United States will never tolerate a safe haven for those who aim to killus. They cannot elude us, nor escape the justice they deserve. 
My fellow Americans, this has been a difficult decade for our country. We've learned anew theprofound cost of war -- a cost that's been paid by the nearly 4,500 Americans who have giventheir lives in Iraq, and the over 1,500 who have done so in Afghanistan -- men and womenwho will not live to enjoy the freedom that they defended. Thousands more have beenwounded. Some have lost limbs on the battlefield, and others still battle the demons that havefollowed them home.
Yet tonight, we take comfort in knowing that the tide of war is receding.  Fewer of our sonsand daughters are serving in harm’s way. We’ve ended our combat mission in Iraq, with100,000 American troops already out of that country. And even as there will be dark daysahead in Afghanistan, the light of a secure peace can be seen in the distance. These long warswill come to a responsible end.
As they do, we must learn their lessons. Already this decade of war has caused many toquestion the nature of America’s engagement around the world. Some would have Americaretreat from our responsibility as an anchor of global security, and embrace an isolation thatignores the very real threats that we face. Others would have America over-extended,confronting every evil that can be found abroad.
We must chart a more centered course. Like generations before, we must embrace America’ssingular role in the course of human events. But we must be as pragmatic as we arepassionate; as strategic as we are resolute. When threatened, we must respond with force --but when that force can be targeted, we need not deploy large armies overseas.
  
When innocents are being slaughtered and global security endangered, we don’t have tochoose between standing idly by or acting on our own. Instead, we must rally internationalaction, which we’re doing in Libya, where we do not have a single soldier on the ground, butare supporting allies in protecting the Libyan people and giving them the chance to determinetheir own destiny.
In all that we do, we must remember that what sets America apart is not solely our power --it is the principles upon which our union was founded. We’re a nation that brings our enemiesto justice while adhering to the rule of law, and respecting the rights of all our citizens. Weprotect our own freedom and prosperity by extending it to others.  We stand not for empire,but for self-determination. That is why we have a stake in the democratic aspirations that arenow washing across the Arab world. We will support those revolutions with fidelity to ourideals, with the power of our example, and with an unwavering belief that all human beingsdeserve to live with freedom and dignity.
Above all, we are a nation whose strength abroad has been anchored in opportunity for ourcitizens here at home. Over the last decade, we have spent a trillion dollars on war, at a timeof rising debt and hard economic times. Now, we must invest in America’s greatest resource --our people. We must unleash innovation that creates new jobs and industries, while livingwithin our means. We must rebuild our infrastructure and find new and clean sources ofenergy. And most of all, after a decade of passionate debate, we must recapture the commonpurpose that we shared at the beginning of this time of war. For our nation draws strengthfrom our differences, and when our union is strong no hill is too steep, no horizon is beyondour reach.
America, it is time to focus on nation building here at home.
In this effort, we draw inspiration from our fellow Americans who have sacrificed so much onour behalf. To our troops, our veterans and their families, I speak for all Americans when Isay that we will keep our sacred trust with you, and provide you with the care and benefitsand opportunity that you deserve.
I met some of these patriotic Americans at Fort Campbell. Awhile back, I spoke to the 101stAirborne that has fought to turn the tide in Afghanistan, and to the team that took out Osamabin Laden. Standing in front of a model of bin Laden’s compound, the Navy SEAL who led thateffort paid tribute to those who had been lost -- brothers and sisters in arms whose names arenow written on bases where our troops stand guard overseas, and on headstones in quietcorners of our country where their memory will never be forgotten. This officer -- like so manyothers I’ve met on bases, in Baghdad and Bagram, and at Walter Reed and Bethesda NavalHospital -- spoke with humility about how his unit worked together as one, depending on eachother, and trusting one another, as a family might do in a time of peril.
  
That’s a lesson worth remembering -- that we are all a part of one American family. Thoughwe have known disagreement and division, we are bound together by the creed that is writteninto our founding documents, and a conviction that the United States of America is a countrythat can achieve whatever it sets out to accomplish. Now, let us finish the work at hand. Letus responsibly end these wars, and reclaim the American Dream that is at the center of ourstory. With confidence in our cause, with faith in our fellow citizens, and with hope in ourhearts, let us go about the work of extending the promise of America -- for this generation,and the next.
May God bless our troops.
And may God bless the United States of America.
