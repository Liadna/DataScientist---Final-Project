Thank you, Governor. To all the families, first responders, to the community of Newtown,clergy, guests -- Scripture tells us:
Do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, inwardly, we are beingrenewed day by day.For light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that faroutweighs them all, so we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen,since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building fromGod, an eternal house in heaven not built by human hands.
We gather here in memory of twenty beautiful children and six remarkable adults.  They losttheir lives in a school that could have been any school; in a quiet town full of good and decentpeople that could be any town in America.
Here in Newtown, I come to offer the love and prayers of a nation.  I am very mindful thatmere words cannot match the depths of your sorrow, nor can they heal your wounded hearts. I can only hope it helps for you to know that you’re not alone in your grief; that our world toohas been torn apart; that all across this land of ours, we have wept with you, we’ve pulled ourchildren tight.  And you must know that whatever measure of comfort we can provide, we willprovide; whatever portion of sadness that we can share with you to ease this heavy load, wewill gladly bear it.
  
Newtown -- you are not alone.
As these difficult days have unfolded, you’ve also inspired us with stories of strength andresolve and sacrifice.  We know that when danger arrived in the halls of Sandy HookElementary, the school’s staff did not flinch, they did not hesitate.  Dawn Hochsprung andMary Sherlach, Vicki Soto, Lauren Rousseau, Rachel Davino and Anne Marie Murphy -- theyresponded as we all hope we might respond in such terrifying circumstances -- with courageand with love, giving their lives to protect the children in their care.
We know that there were other teachers who barricaded themselves inside classrooms, andkept steady through it all, and reassured their students by saying "wait for the good guys,they’re coming"; "show me your smile."
And we know that good guys came.  The first responders who raced to the scene, helping toguide those in harm’s way to safety, and comfort those in need, holding at bay their ownshock and trauma because they had a job to do, and others needed them more.
And then there were the scenes of the schoolchildren, helping one another, holding eachother, dutifully following instructions in the way that young children sometimes do; one childeven trying to encourage a grown-up by saying, "I know karate.  So it’s okay.  I’ll lead theway out."
As a community, you’ve inspired us, Newtown.  In the face of indescribable violence, in theface of unconscionable evil, you’ve looked out for each other, and you’ve cared for oneanother, and you’ve loved one another.  This is how Newtown will be remembered.  And withtime, and God’s grace, that love will see you through.
But we, as a nation, we are left with some hard questions.  Someone once described the joyand anxiety of parenthood as the equivalent of having your heart outside of your body all thetime, walking around.  With their very first cry, this most precious, vital part of ourselves --our child -- is suddenly exposed to the world, to possible mishap or malice.  And every parentknows there is nothing we will not do to shield our children from harm.  And yet, we alsoknow that with that child’s very first step, and each step after that, they are separating fromus; that we won’t -- that we can’t always be there for them.  They’ll suffer sickness andsetbacks and broken hearts and disappointments.  And we learn that our most important jobis to give them what they need to become self-reliant and capable and resilient, ready to facethe world without fear.
And we know we can’t do this by ourselves.  It comes as a shock at a certain point where yourealize, no matter how much you love these kids, you can’t do it by yourself.  That this job ofkeeping our children safe, and teaching them well, is something we can only do together, withthe help of friends and neighbors, the help of a community, and the help of a nation.
  
And in that way, we come to realize that we bear a responsibility for every child because we’recounting on everybody else to help look after ours; that we’re all parents; that they’re all ourchildren.
This is our first task -- caring for our children.  It’s our first job.  If we don’t get that right, wedon’t get anything right.  That’s how, as a society, we will be judged.
And by that measure, can we truly say, as a nation, that we are meeting our obligations?  Canwe honestly say that we’re doing enough to keep our children -- all of them -- safe fromharm?  Can we claim, as a nation, that we’re all together there, letting them know that theyare loved, and teaching them to love in return?  Can we say that we’re truly doing enough togive all the children of this country the chance they deserve to live out their lives in happinessand with purpose?
I’ve been reflecting on this the last few days, and if we’re honest with ourselves, the answer isno.  We’re not doing enough.  And we will have to change.
Since I’ve been President, this is the fourth time we have come together to comfort a grievingcommunity torn apart by a mass shooting.  The fourth time we’ve hugged survivors.  Thefourth time we’ve consoled the families of victims.  And in between, there have been anendless series of deadly shootings across the country, almost daily reports of victims, many ofthem children, in small towns and big cities all across America -- victims whose -- much of thetime, their only fault was being in the wrong place at the wrong time.
We can’t tolerate this anymore.  These tragedies must end.  And to end them, we mustchange.  We will be told that the causes of such violence are complex, and that is true.  Nosingle law -- no set of laws can eliminate evil from the world, or prevent every senseless actof violence in our society.
But that can’t be an excuse for inaction.  Surely, we can do better than this.  If there is evenone step we can take to save another child, or another parent, or another town, from the griefthat has visited Tucson, and Aurora, and Oak Creek, and Newtown, and communities fromColumbine to Blacksburg before that -- then surely we have an obligation to try.
In the coming weeks, I will use whatever power this office holds to engage my fellow citizens -
- from law enforcement to mental health professionals to parents and educators -- in an effortaimed at preventing more tragedies like this.  Because what choice do we have?  We can’taccept events like this as routine.  Are we really prepared to say that we’re powerless in theface of such carnage, that the politics are too hard?  Are we prepared to say that suchviolence visited on our children year after year after year is somehow the price of ourfreedom?
  
All the world’s religions -- so many of them represented here today -- start with a simplequestion:  Why are we here?  What gives our life meaning?  What gives our acts purpose?  Weknow our time on this Earth is fleeting.  We know that we will each have our share of pleasureand pain; that even after we chase after some earthly goal, whether it’s wealth or power orfame, or just simple comfort, we will, in some fashion, fall short of what we had hoped.  Weknow that no matter how good our intentions, we will all stumble sometimes, in some way. We will make mistakes, we will experience hardships.  And even when we’re trying to do theright thing, we know that much of our time will be spent groping through the darkness, sooften unable to discern God’s heavenly plans.
There’s only one thing we can be sure of, and that is the love that we have -- for our children,for our families, for each other.  The warmth of a small child’s embrace -- that is true.  Thememories we have of them, the joy that they bring, the wonder we see through their eyes,that fierce and boundless love we feel for them, a love that takes us out of ourselves, andbinds us to something larger -- we know that’s what matters.  We know we’re always doingright when we’re taking care of them, when we’re teaching them well, when we’re showingacts of kindness.  We don’t go wrong when we do that.
That’s what we can be sure of.  And that’s what you, the people of Newtown, have remindedus.  That’s how you’ve inspired us.  You remind us what matters.  And that’s what shoulddrive us forward in everything we do, for as long as God sees fit to keep us on this Earth.
“Let the little children come to me,” Jesus said, “and do not hinder them -- for to such belongsthe kingdom of heaven.”
Charlotte.  Daniel.  Olivia.  Josephine.  Ana.  Dylan.  Madeleine.  Catherine.  Chase.  Jesse. James.  Grace.  Emilie.  Jack.  Noah.  Caroline.  Jessica.  Benjamin.  Avielle.  Allison.
God has called them all home.  For those of us who remain, let us find the strength to carryon, and make our country worthy of their memory.
May God bless and keep those we’ve lost in His heavenly place.  May He grace those we stillhave with His holy comfort.  And may He bless and watch over this community, and theUnited States of America.
