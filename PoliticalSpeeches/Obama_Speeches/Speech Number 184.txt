Good morning, everyone.  It is a great honor to be with you here today.  Of course, it is atruly humbling moment to be introduced by Elie Wiesel.  Along with Sara Bloomfield, theoutstanding director here, we just spent some time among the exhibits, and this is now thesecond visit I've had here.  My daughters have come here.  It is a searing occasion wheneveryou visit.  And as we walked, I was taken back to the visit that Elie mentioned, the time thatwe traveled together to Buchenwald.
And I recall how he showed me the barbed-wire fences and the guard towers.  And we walkedthe rows where the barracks once stood, where so many left this Earth -- including Elie’sfather, Shlomo.  We stopped at an old photo -- men and boys lying in their wooden bunks,barely more than skeletons.  And if you look closely, you can see a 16-year old boy, lookingright at the camera, right into your eyes.  You can see Elie.
And at the end of our visit that day, Elie spoke of his father.  "I thought one day I will comeback and speak to him," he said, "of times in which memory has become a sacred duty of allpeople of goodwill."  Elie, you've devoted your life to upholding that sacred duty.  You’vechallenged us all -- as individuals, and as nations -- to do the same, with the power of yourexample, the eloquence of your words, as you did again just now.  And so to you and Marion,we are extraordinarily grateful.
  
To Sara, to Tom Bernstein, to Josh Bolten, members of the United States Holocaust MemorialCouncil, and everyone who sustains this living memorial -- thank you for welcoming us heretoday.  To the members of Congress, members of the diplomatic corps, including AmbassadorMichael Oren of Israel, we are glad to be with you.
And most of all, we are honored to be in the presence of men and women whose lives are atestament to the endurance and the strength of the human spirit -- the inspiring survivors.  Itis a privilege to be with you, on a very personal level.  As I’ve told some of you before, I grewup hearing stories about my great uncle -- a soldier in the 89th Infantry Division who wasstunned and shaken by what he saw when he helped to liberate Ordruf, part of Buchenwald.  And I’ll never forget what I saw at Buchenwald, where so many perished with the words ofSh’ma Yis’ra’eil on their lips.
I’ve stood with survivors, in the old Warsaw ghettos, where a monument honors heroes whosaid we will not go quietly; we will stand up, we will fight back.  And I’ve walked those sacredgrounds at Yad Vashem, with its lesson for all nations -- the Shoah cannot be denied.
During my visit to Yad Vashem I was given a gift, inscribed with those words from the Book ofJoel:  "Has the like of this happened in your days or in the days of your fathers?  Tell yourchildren about it, and let your children tell theirs, and their children the next generation." That’s why we’re here.  Not simply to remember, but to speak.
I say this as a President, and I say it as a father.  We must tell our children about a crimeunique in human history.  The one and only Holocaust -- six million innocent people -- men,women, children, babies -- sent to their deaths just for being different, just for being Jewish. We tell them, our children, about the millions of Poles and Catholics and Roma and gay peopleand so many others who also must never be forgotten.  Let us tell our children not only howthey died, but also how they lived -- as fathers and mothers, and sons and daughters, andbrothers and sisters who loved and hoped and dreamed, just like us.
We must tell our children about how this evil was allowed to happen -- because so manypeople succumbed to their darkest instincts, and because so many others stood silent.  Let usalso tell our children about the Righteous Among the Nations.  Among them was Jan Karski, ayoung Polish Catholic, who witnessed Jews being put on cattle cars, who saw the killings, andwho told the truth, all the way to President Roosevelt himself.
  
Jan Karski passed away more than a decade ago.  But today, I’m proud to announce that thisspring I will honor him with America’s highest civilian honor -- the Presidential Medal ofFreedom.
We must tell our children.  But more than that, we must teach them.  Because remembrancewithout resolve is a hollow gesture.  Awareness without action changes nothing.  In thissense, "never again" is a challenge to us all -- to pause and to look within.
For the Holocaust may have reached its barbaric climax at Treblinka and Auschwitz andBelzec, but it started in the hearts of ordinary men and women.  And we have seen it again --madness that can sweep through peoples, sweep through nations, embed itself.  The killingsin Cambodia, the killings in Rwanda, the killings in Bosnia, the killings in Darfur -- they shockour conscience, but they are the awful extreme of a spectrum of ignorance and intolerancethat we see every day; the bigotry that says another person is less than my equal, less thanhuman.  These are the seeds of hate that we cannot let take root in our heart.
"Never again" is a challenge to reject hatred in all of its forms -- including anti-Semitism,which has no place in a civilized world.  And today, just steps from where he gave his lifeprotecting this place, we honor the memory of Officer Stephen Tyrone Johns, whose familyjoins us today.
"Never again" is a challenge to defend the fundamental right of free people and free nations toexist in peace and security -- and that includes the State of Israel.  And on my visit to the oldWarsaw Ghetto, a woman looked me in the eye, and she wanted to make sure America stoodwith Israel.  She said, "It’s the only Jewish state we have."  And I made her a promise in thatsolemn place.  I said I will always be there for Israel. So when efforts are made to equate Zionism to racism, we reject them.  When internationalfora single out Israel with unfair resolutions, we vote against them.  When attempts are madeto delegitimize the state of Israel, we oppose them.  When faced with a regime that threatensglobal security and denies the Holocaust and threatens to destroy Israel, the United States willdo everything in our power to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
"Never again" is a challenge to societies.  We’re joined today by communities who’ve made ityour mission to prevent mass atrocities in our time.  This museum’s Committee of Conscience,NGOs, faith groups, college students, you’ve harnessed the tools of the digital age -- onlinemaps and satellites and a video and social media campaign seen by millions.
  
You understand that change comes from the bottom up, from the grassroots.  You understand-- to quote the task force convened by this museum -- "preventing genocide is an achievablegoal."  It is an achievable goal.  It is one that does not start from the top; it starts from thebottom up.
It’s remarkable -- as we walked through this exhibit, Elie and I were talking as we looked atthe unhappy record of the State Department and so many officials here in the United Statesduring those years.  And he asked, "What would you do?"  But what you all understand is youdon't just count on officials, you don't just count on governments.  You count on people -- andmobilizing their consciences.
And finally, "never again" is a challenge to nations.  It’s a bitter truth -- too often, the worldhas failed to prevent the killing of innocents on a massive scale.  And we are haunted by theatrocities that we did not stop and the lives we did not save.
Three years ago today, I joined many of you for a ceremony of remembrance at the U.S.Capitol.  And I said that we had to do "everything we can to prevent and end atrocities."  Andso I want to report back to some of you today to let you know that as President I’ve done myutmost to back up those words with deeds.  Last year, in the first-ever presidential directiveon this challenge, I made it clear that "preventing mass atrocities and genocide is a corenational security interest and a core moral responsibility of the United States of America."
That does not mean that we intervene militarily every time there’s an injustice in the world. We cannot and should not.  It does mean we possess many tools -- diplomatic and political,and economic and financial, and intelligence and law enforcement and our moral suasion --and using these tools over the past three years, I believe -- I know -- that we have savedcountless lives.
When the referendum in South Sudan was in doubt, it threatened to reignite a conflict thathad killed millions.  But with determined diplomacy, including by some people in this room,South Sudan became the world’s newest nation.  And our diplomacy continues, because inDarfur, in Abyei, in Southern Kordofan and the Blue Nile, the killing of innocents must come toan end.  The Presidents of Sudan and South Sudan must have the courage to negotiate --because the people of Sudan and South Sudan deserve peace.  That is work that we havedone, and it has saved lives.
  
When the incumbent in Côte D’Ivoire lost an election but refused to give it up -- give uppower, it threatened to unleash untold ethnic and religious killings.  But with regional andinternational diplomacy, and U.N. peacekeepers who stood their ground and protectedcivilians, the former leader is now in The Hague, and Côte D’Ivoire is governed by its rightfulleader -- and lives were saved.
When the Libyan people demanded their rights and Muammar Qaddafi’s forces bore down onBenghazi, a city of 700,000, and threatened to hunt down its people like rats, we forged withallies and partners a coalition that stopped his troops in their tracks.  And today, the Libyanpeople are forging their own future, and the world can take pride in the innocent lives that wesaved.
And when the Lord’s Resistance Army led by Joseph Kony continued its atrocities in CentralAfrica, I ordered a small number of American advisors to help Uganda and its neighborspursue the LRA.  And when I made that announcement, I directed my National SecurityCouncil to review our progress after 150 days.  We have done so, and today I can announcethat our advisors will continue their efforts to bring this madman to justice, and to save lives. It is part of our regional strategy to end the scourge that is the LRA, and help realize a futurewhere no African child is stolen from their family and no girl is raped and no boy is turned intoa child soldier.
We’ve stepped up our efforts in other ways.  We’re doing more to protect women and girlsfrom the horror of wartime sexual violence.  With the arrest of fugitives like Ratko Mladic,charged with ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, the world sent a message to war criminalseverywhere:  We will not relent in bringing you to justice.  Be on notice.  And for the firsttime, we explicitly barred entry into the United States of those responsible for war crimes andcrimes against humanity.
Now we’re doing something more.  We’re making sure that the United States government hasthe structures, the mechanisms to better prevent and respond to mass atrocities.  So Icreated the first-ever White House position dedicated to this task.  It’s why I created a newAtrocities Prevention Board, to bring together senior officials from across our government tofocus on this critical mission.  This is not an afterthought.  This is not a sideline in our foreignpolicy.  The board will convene for the first time today, at the White House.  And I’m pleasedthat one of its first acts will be to meet with some of your organizations -- citizens andactivists who are partners in this work, who have been carrying this torch.
  
Going forward, we’ll strengthen our tools across the board, and we'll create new ones.  Theintelligence community will prepare, for example, the first-ever National Intelligence Estimateon the risk of mass atrocities and genocide.  We're going to institutionalize the focus on thisissue.  Across government, "alert channels" will ensure that information about unfolding crises-- and dissenting opinions -- quickly reach decision-makers, including me.
Our Treasury Department will work to more quickly deploy its financial tools to block the flowof money to abusive regimes.  Our military will take additional steps to incorporate theprevention of atrocities into its doctrine and its planning.  And the State Department willincrease its ability to surge our diplomats and experts in a crisis.  USAID will invite people andhigh-tech companies to help create new technologies to quickly expose violations of humanrights.  And we’ll work with other nations so the burden is better shared -- because this is aglobal responsibility.
In short, we need to be doing everything we can to prevent and respond to these kinds ofatrocities -- because national sovereignty is never a license to slaughter your people.
We recognize that, even as we do all we can, we cannot control every event.  And wheninnocents suffer, it tears at our conscience.  Elie alluded to what we feel as we see the Syrianpeople subjected to unspeakable violence, simply for demanding their universal rights.  Andwe have to do everything we can.  And as we do, we have to remember that despite all thetanks and all the snipers, all the torture and brutality unleashed against them, the Syrianpeople still brave the streets.  They still demand to be heard.  They still seek their dignity. The Syrian people have not given up, which is why we cannot give up.
And so with allies and partners, we will keep increasing the pressure, with a diplomatic effortto further isolate Assad and his regime, so that those who stick with Assad know that they aremaking a losing bet.  We’ll keep increasing sanctions to cut off the regime from the money itneeds to survive.  We’ll sustain a legal effort to document atrocities so killers face justice, anda humanitarian effort to get relief and medicine to the Syrian people.  And we’ll keep workingwith the "Friends of Syria" to increase support for the Syrian opposition as it grows stronger.
Indeed, today we’re taking another step.  I’ve signed an executive order that authorizes newsanctions against the Syrian government and Iran and those that abet them for usingtechnologies to monitor and track and target citizens for violence.  These technologies shouldnot empower -- these technologies should be in place to empower citizens, not to repressthem.
  
And it’s one more step that we can take toward the day that we know will come -- the end ofthe Assad regime that has brutalized the Syrian people -- and allow the Syrian people to charttheir own destiny.
Even with all the efforts I’ve described today, even with everything that hopefully we havelearned, even with the incredible power of museums like this one, even with everything thatwe do to try to teach our children about our own responsibilities, we know that our work willnever be done. There will be conflicts that are not easily resolved.  There will be senselessdeaths that aren’t prevented.  There will be stories of pain and hardship that test our hopesand try our conscience.  And in such moments it can be hard to imagine a more just world.
It can be tempting to throw up our hands and resign ourselves to man’s endless capacity forcruelty.  It’s tempting sometimes to believe that there is nothing we can do.  And all of ushave those doubts.  All of us have those moments -- perhaps especially those who work mostardently in these fields.
So in the end, I come back to something Elie said that day we visited Buchenwald together. Reflecting on all that he had endured, he said, "We had the right to give up."  "We had theright to give up on humanity, to give up on culture, to give up on education, to give up on thepossibility of living one's life with dignity, in a world that has no place for dignity."  They hadthat right.  Imagine what they went through.  They had the right to give up.  Nobody wouldbegrudge them that.  Who’d question someone giving up in such circumstances?
But, Elie said, "We rejected that possibility, and we said, no, we must continue believing in afuture."  To stare into the abyss, to face the darkness and insist there is a future -- to not giveup, to say yes to life, to believe in the possibility of justice.
To Elie and to the survivors who are here today, thank you for not giving up.  You show us theway.  You show us the way.  If you cannot give up, if you can believe, then we can believe.  Ifyou can continue to strive and speak, then we can speak and strive for a future where there’sa place for dignity for every human being.  That has been the cause of your lives.  It must bethe work of our nation and of all nations.
So God bless you.
And God bless the United States of America.
Thank you very much.
