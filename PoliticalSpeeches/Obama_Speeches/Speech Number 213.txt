Fifty-one years ago, John F. Kennedy declared to this chamber that “the Constitution makesus not rivals for power but partners for progress.”  “It is my task,” he said, “to report theState of the Union -- to improve it is the task of us all.”
Tonight, thanks to the grit and determination of the American people, there is much progressto report.  After a decade of grinding war, our brave men and women in uniform are cominghome.  After years of grueling recession, our businesses have created over six million newjobs.  We buy more American cars than we have in five years, and less foreign oil than wehave in 20.  Our housing market is healing, our stock market is rebounding, and consumers,patients, and homeowners enjoy stronger protections than ever before.
So, together, we have cleared away the rubble of crisis, and we can say with renewedconfidence that the State of our Union is stronger.
But we gather here knowing that there are millions of Americans whose hard work anddedication have not yet been rewarded.  Our economy is adding jobs -- but too many peoplestill can’t find full-time employment.  Corporate profits have skyrocketed to all-time highs --but for more than a decade, wages and incomes have barely budged.
It is our generation’s task, then, to reignite the true engine of America’s economic growth -- arising, thriving middle class.
  
It is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that built this country -- the idea that ifyou work hard and meet your responsibilities, you can get ahead, no matter where you comefrom, no matter what you look like, or who you love.
It is our unfinished task to make sure that this government works on behalf of the many, andnot just the few; that it encourages free enterprise, rewards individual initiative, and opensthe doors of opportunity to every child across this great nation.
The American people don’t expect government to solve every problem.  They don’t expectthose of us in this chamber to agree on every issue.  But they do expect us to put the nation’sinterests before party.  They do expect us to forge reasonable compromise where we can.  Forthey know that America moves forward only when we do so together, and that theresponsibility of improving this union remains the task of us all.
Our work must begin by making some basic decisions about our budget -- decisions that willhave a huge impact on the strength of our recovery.
Over the last few years, both parties have worked together to reduce the deficit by more than$2.5 trillion -- mostly through spending cuts, but also by raising tax rates on the wealthiest 1percent of Americans.  As a result, we are more than halfway towards the goal of $4 trillion indeficit reduction that economists say we need to stabilize our finances.
Now we need to finish the job.  And the question is, how?
In 2011, Congress passed a law saying that if both parties couldn’t agree on a plan to reachour deficit goal, about a trillion dollars’ worth of budget cuts would automatically go into effectthis year.  These sudden, harsh, arbitrary cuts would jeopardize our military readiness. They’d devastate priorities like education, and energy, and medical research.  They wouldcertainly slow our recovery, and cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs.  That’s whyDemocrats, Republicans, business leaders, and economists have already said that these cuts,known here in Washington as the sequester, are a really bad idea.
Now, some in Congress have proposed preventing only the defense cuts by making evenbigger cuts to things like education and job training, Medicare and Social Security benefits. That idea is even worse.
Yes, the biggest driver of our long-term debt is the rising cost of health care for an agingpopulation.  And those of us who care deeply about programs like Medicare must embrace theneed for modest reforms -- otherwise, our retirement programs will crowd out theinvestments we need for our children, and jeopardize the promise of a secure retirement forfuture generations.
  
But we can’t ask senior citizens and working families to shoulder the entire burden of deficitreduction while asking nothing more from the wealthiest and the most powerful.  We won’tgrow the middle class simply by shifting the cost of health care or college onto families thatare already struggling, or by forcing communities to lay off more teachers and more cops andmore firefighters.  Most Americans -- Democrats, Republicans, and independents --understand that we can’t just cut our way to prosperity.  They know that broad-basedeconomic growth requires a balanced approach to deficit reduction, with spending cuts andrevenue, and with everybody doing their fair share.  And that’s the approach I offer tonight.
On Medicare, I’m prepared to enact reforms that will achieve the same amount of health caresavings by the beginning of the next decade as the reforms proposed by the bipartisanSimpson-Bowles commission.
Already, the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of health care costs.  And thereforms I’m proposing go even further.  We’ll reduce taxpayer subsidies to prescription drugcompanies and ask more from the wealthiest seniors.  We’ll bring down costs by changing theway our government pays for Medicare, because our medical bills shouldn’t be based on thenumber of tests ordered or days spent in the hospital; they should be based on the quality ofcare that our seniors receive.  And I am open to additional reforms from both parties, so longas they don’t violate the guarantee of a secure retirement.  Our government shouldn’t makepromises we cannot keep -- but we must keep the promises we’ve already made.
To hit the rest of our deficit reduction target, we should do what leaders in both parties havealready suggested, and save hundreds of billions of dollars by getting rid of tax loopholes anddeductions for the well-off and the well-connected.  After all, why would we choose to makedeeper cuts to education and Medicare just to protect special interest tax breaks?  How is thatfair?  Why is it that deficit reduction is a big emergency justifying making cuts in SocialSecurity benefits but not closing some loopholes?  How does that promote growth?
Now is our best chance for bipartisan, comprehensive tax reform that encourages job creationand helps bring down the deficit.  We can get this done.  The American people deserve a taxcode that helps small businesses spend less time filling out complicated forms, and more timeexpanding and hiring -- a tax code that ensures billionaires with high-powered accountantscan’t work the system and pay a lower rate than their hardworking secretaries; a tax codethat lowers incentives to move jobs overseas, and lowers tax rates for businesses andmanufacturers that are creating jobs right here in the United States of America.  That’s whattax reform can deliver.  That’s what we can do together.
I realize that tax reform and entitlement reform will not be easy.  The politics will be hard forboth sides.  None of us will get 100 percent of what we want.  But the alternative will cost usjobs, hurt our economy, visit hardship on millions of hardworking Americans.  So let’s setparty interests aside and work to pass a budget that replaces reckless cuts with smart savingsand wise investments in our future.
  
And let’s do it without the brinksmanship that stresses consumers and scares off investors. The greatest nation on Earth cannot keep conducting its business by drifting from onemanufactured crisis to the next.  We can't do it.
Let’s agree right here, right now to keep the people’s government open, and pay our bills ontime, and always uphold the full faith and credit of the United States of America.  TheAmerican people have worked too hard, for too long, rebuilding from one crisis to see theirelected officials cause another.
Now, most of us agree that a plan to reduce the deficit must be part of our agenda.  But let’sbe clear, deficit reduction alone is not an economic plan.   A growing economy that createsgood, middle-class jobs -- that must be the North Star that guides our efforts.  Every day, weshould ask ourselves three questions as a nation:  How do we attract more jobs to our shores? How do we equip our people with the skills they need to get those jobs?  And how do wemake sure that hard work leads to a decent living?
A year and a half ago, I put forward an American Jobs Act that independent economists saidwould create more than 1 million new jobs.  And I thank the last Congress for passing some ofthat agenda.  I urge this Congress to pass the rest.  But tonight, I’ll lay out additionalproposals that are fully paid for and fully consistent with the budget framework both partiesagreed to just 18 months ago.  Let me repeat -- nothing I’m proposing tonight shouldincrease our deficit by a single dime.  It is not a bigger government we need, but a smartergovernment that sets priorities and invests in broad-based growth.  That's what we should belooking for.
Our first priority is making America a magnet for new jobs and manufacturing.  After sheddingjobs for more than 10 years, our manufacturers have added about 500,000 jobs over the pastthree.  Caterpillar is bringing jobs back from Japan.  Ford is bringing jobs back from Mexico. And this year, Apple will start making Macs in America again.
There are things we can do, right now, to accelerate this trend.  Last year, we created our firstmanufacturing innovation institute in Youngstown, Ohio.  A once-shuttered warehouse is nowa state-of-the art lab where new workers are mastering the 3D printing that has the potentialto revolutionize the way we make almost everything.  There’s no reason this can’t happen inother towns.
So tonight, I’m announcing the launch of three more of these manufacturing hubs, wherebusinesses will partner with the Department of Defense and Energy to turn regions left behindby globalization into global centers of high-tech jobs.  And I ask this Congress to help create anetwork of 15 of these hubs and guarantee that the next revolution in manufacturing is maderight here in America.  We can get that done.
Now, if we want to make the best products, we also have to invest in the best ideas.  Everydollar we invested to map the human genome returned $140 to our economy -- every dollar.
  
Today, our scientists are mapping the human brain to unlock the answers to Alzheimer’s.They’re developing drugs to regenerate damaged organs; devising new material to makebatteries 10 times more powerful.  Now is not the time to gut these job-creating investmentsin science and innovation.  Now is the time to reach a level of research and development notseen since the height of the Space Race.  We need to make those investments.
Today, no area holds more promise than our investments in American energy.  After years oftalking about it, we’re finally poised to control our own energy future.  We produce more oil athome than we have in 15 years. We have doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon ofgas, and the amount of renewable energy we generate from sources like wind and solar --with tens of thousands of good American jobs to show for it.  We produce more natural gasthan ever before -- and nearly everyone’s energy bill is lower because of it.  And over the lastfour years, our emissions of the dangerous carbon pollution that threatens our planet haveactually fallen.
But for the sake of our children and our future, we must do more to combat climate change. Now, it’s true that no single event makes a trend.  But the fact is the 12 hottest years onrecord have all come in the last 15.  Heat waves, droughts, wildfires, floods -- all are nowmore frequent and more intense.  We can choose to believe that Superstorm Sandy, and themost severe drought in decades, and the worst wildfires some states have ever seen were alljust a freak coincidence.  Or we can choose to believe in the overwhelming judgment ofscience -- and act before it’s too late.
Now, the good news is we can make meaningful progress on this issue while driving strongeconomic growth.  I urge this Congress to get together, pursue a bipartisan, market-basedsolution to climate change, like the one John McCain and Joe Lieberman worked on together afew years ago.  But if Congress won’t act soon to protect future generations, I will.  I willdirect my Cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take, now and in the future, toreduce pollution, prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change, and speedthe transition to more sustainable sources of energy.
Four years ago, other countries dominated the clean energy market and the jobs that camewith it.  And we’ve begun to change that.  Last year, wind energy added nearly half of all newpower capacity in America.  So let’s generate even more.  Solar energy gets cheaper by theyear -- let’s drive down costs even further. As long as countries like China keep going all in onclean energy, so must we.
Now, in the meantime, the natural gas boom has led to cleaner power and greater energyindependence.  We need to encourage that.  And that’s why my administration will keepcutting red tape and speeding up new oil and gas permits. That’s got to be part of an all-of-
the-above plan.  But I also want to work with this Congress to encourage the research andtechnology that helps natural gas burn even cleaner and protects our air and our water.
  
In fact, much of our new-found energy is drawn from lands and waters that we, the public,own together.  So tonight, I propose we use some of our oil and gas revenues to fund anEnergy Security Trust that will drive new research and technology to shift our cars and trucksoff oil for good.  If a nonpartisan coalition of CEOs and retired generals and admirals can getbehind this idea, then so can we.  Let’s take their advice and free our families and businessesfrom the painful spikes in gas prices we’ve put up with for far too long.
I’m also issuing a new goal for America:  Let’s cut in half the energy wasted by our homes andbusinesses over the next 20 years.  We'll work with the states to do it.  Those states with thebest ideas to create jobs and lower energy bills by constructing more efficient buildings willreceive federal support to help make that happen.
America’s energy sector is just one part of an aging infrastructure badly in need of repair.  Askany CEO where they’d rather locate and hire -- a country with deteriorating roads and bridges,or one with high-speed rail and Internet; high-tech schools, self-healing power grids.  TheCEO of Siemens America -- a company that brought hundreds of new jobs to North Carolina --said that if we upgrade our infrastructure, they’ll bring even more jobs.  And that’s theattitude of a lot of companies all around the world.  And I know you want these job-creatingprojects in your district.  I’ve seen all those ribbon-cuttings.
So tonight, I propose a “Fix-It-First” program to put people to work as soon as possible on ourmost urgent repairs, like the nearly 70,000 structurally deficient bridges across the country.And to make sure taxpayers don’t shoulder the whole burden, I’m also proposing aPartnership to Rebuild America that attracts private capital to upgrade what our businessesneed most:  modern ports to move our goods, modern pipelines to withstand a storm, modernschools worthy of our children.  Let’s prove that there’s no better place to do business thanhere in the United States of America, and let’s start right away.  We can get this done.
And part of our rebuilding effort must also involve our housing sector.  The good news is ourhousing market is finally healing from the collapse of 2007.  Home prices are rising at thefastest pace in six years.  Home purchases are up nearly 50 percent, and construction isexpanding again.
But even with mortgage rates near a 50-year low, too many families with solid credit whowant to buy a home are being rejected.  Too many families who never missed a payment andwant to refinance are being told no.  That’s holding our entire economy back.  We need to fixit.
Right now, there’s a bill in this Congress that would give every responsible homeowner inAmerica the chance to save $3,000 a year by refinancing at today’s rates.  Democrats andRepublicans have supported it before, so what are we waiting for? Take a vote, and send methat bill.
  
Why would we be against that?  Why would that be a partisan issue, helping folks refinance? Right now, overlapping regulations keep responsible young families from buying their firsthome.  What’s holding us back?  Let’s streamline the process, and help our economy grow.
These initiatives in manufacturing, energy, infrastructure, housing -- all these things will helpentrepreneurs and small business owners expand and create new jobs.  But none of it willmatter unless we also equip our citizens with the skills and training to fill those jobs.
And that has to start at the earliest possible age.  Study after study shows that the sooner achild begins learning, the better he or she does down the road.  But today, fewer than 3 in 10four year-olds are enrolled in a high-quality preschool program.  Most middle-class parentscan’t afford a few hundred bucks a week for a private preschool.  And for poor kids who needhelp the most, this lack of access to preschool education can shadow them for the rest of theirlives.  So tonight, I propose working with states to make high-quality preschool available toevery single child in America.  That's something we should be able to do.
Every dollar we invest in high-quality early childhood education can save more than sevendollars later on -- by boosting graduation rates, reducing teen pregnancy, even reducingviolent crime.  In states that make it a priority to educate our youngest children, like Georgiaor Oklahoma, studies show students grow up more likely to read and do math at grade level,graduate high school, hold a job, form more stable families of their own.  We know this works. So let’s do what works and make sure none of our children start the race of life alreadybehind. Let’s give our kids that chance.
Let’s also make sure that a high school diploma puts our kids on a path to a good job.  Rightnow, countries like Germany focus on graduating their high school students with theequivalent of a technical degree from one of our community colleges.  So those German kids,they're ready for a job when they graduate high school.  They've been trained for the jobsthat are there.  Now at schools like P-Tech in Brooklyn, a collaboration between New YorkPublic Schools and City University of New York and IBM, students will graduate with a highschool diploma and an associate's degree in computers or engineering.
We need to give every American student opportunities like this.
And four years ago, we started Race to the Top -- a competition that convinced almost everystate to develop smarter curricula and higher standards, all for about 1 percent of what wespend on education each year.  Tonight, I’m announcing a new challenge to redesignAmerica’s high schools so they better equip graduates for the demands of a high-techeconomy.  And we’ll reward schools that develop new partnerships with colleges andemployers, and create classes that focus on science, technology, engineering and math -- theskills today’s employers are looking for to fill the jobs that are there right now and will bethere in the future.
  
Now, even with better high schools, most young people will need some higher education.  It’sa simple fact the more education you’ve got, the more likely you are to have a good job andwork your way into the middle class.  But today, skyrocketing costs price too many youngpeople out of a higher education, or saddle them with unsustainable debt.
Through tax credits, grants and better loans, we’ve made college more affordable for millionsof students and families over the last few years.  But taxpayers can’t keep on subsidizinghigher and higher and higher costs for higher education.  Colleges must do their part to keepcosts down, and it’s our job to make sure that they do.
So tonight, I ask Congress to change the Higher Education Act so that affordability and valueare included in determining which colleges receive certain types of federal aid.  And tomorrow,my administration will release a new “College Scorecard” that parents and students can use tocompare schools based on a simple criteria -- where you can get the most bang for youreducational buck.
Now, to grow our middle class, our citizens have to have access to the education and trainingthat today’s jobs require.  But we also have to make sure that America remains a place whereeveryone who’s willing to work -- everybody who’s willing to work hard has the chance to getahead.
Our economy is stronger when we harness the talents and ingenuity of striving, hopefulimmigrants.  And right now, leaders from the business, labor, law enforcement, faithcommunities -- they all agree that the time has come to pass comprehensive immigrationreform.  Now is the time to do it.  Now is the time to get it done.  Now is the time to get itdone.
Real reform means strong border security, and we can build on the progress myadministration has already made -- putting more boots on the Southern border than at anytime in our history and reducing illegal crossings to their lowest levels in 40 years.
Real reform means establishing a responsible pathway to earned citizenship -- a path thatincludes passing a background check, paying taxes and a meaningful penalty, learningEnglish, and going to the back of the line behind the folks trying to come here legally.
And real reform means fixing the legal immigration system to cut waiting periods and attractthe highly-skilled entrepreneurs and engineers that will help create jobs and grow oureconomy.
In other words, we know what needs to be done.  And as we speak, bipartisan groups in bothchambers are working diligently to draft a bill, and I applaud their efforts.  So let’s get thisdone.  Send me a comprehensive immigration reform bill in the next few months, and I willsign it right away.  And America will be better for it.  Let’s get it done.  Let’s get it done.
  
But we can’t stop there.  We know our economy is stronger when our wives, our mothers, ourdaughters can live their lives free from discrimination in the workplace, and free from the fearof domestic violence.  Today, the Senate passed the Violence Against Women Act that JoeBiden originally wrote almost 20 years ago.  And I now urge the House to do the same.  Goodjob, Joe.  And I ask this Congress to declare that women should earn a living equal to theirefforts, and finally pass the Paycheck Fairness Act this year.
We know our economy is stronger when we reward an honest day’s work with honest wages. But today, a full-time worker making the minimum wage earns $14,500 a year.  Even withthe tax relief we put in place, a family with two kids that earns the minimum wage still livesbelow the poverty line.  That’s wrong.  That’s why, since the last time this Congress raised theminimum wage, 19 states have chosen to bump theirs even higher.
Tonight, let’s declare that in the wealthiest nation on Earth, no one who works full-time shouldhave to live in poverty, and raise the federal minimum wage to $9.00 an hour.  We should beable to get that done.
This single step would raise the incomes of millions of working families.  It could mean thedifference between groceries or the food bank; rent or eviction; scraping by or finally gettingahead.  For businesses across the country, it would mean customers with more money in theirpockets.  And a whole lot of folks out there would probably need less help from government. In fact, working folks shouldn’t have to wait year after year for the minimum wage to go upwhile CEO pay has never been higher.  So here’s an idea that Governor Romney and I actuallyagreed on last year -- let’s tie the minimum wage to the cost of living, so that it finallybecomes a wage you can live on.
Tonight, let’s also recognize that there are communities in this country where no matter howhard you work, it is virtually impossible to get ahead.  Factory towns decimated from years ofplants packing up.  Inescapable pockets of poverty, urban and rural, where young adults arestill fighting for their first job.  America is not a place where the chance of birth orcircumstance should decide our destiny.  And that’s why we need to build new ladders ofopportunity into the middle class for all who are willing to climb them.
Let’s offer incentives to companies that hire Americans who’ve got what it takes to fill that jobopening, but have been out of work so long that no one will give them a chance anymore.Let’s put people back to work rebuilding vacant homes in run-down neighborhoods.  And thisyear, my administration will begin to partner with 20 of the hardest-hit towns in America toget these communities back on their feet.  We’ll work with local leaders to target resources atpublic safety, and education, and housing.
We’ll give new tax credits to businesses that hire and invest.  And we’ll work to strengthenfamilies by removing the financial deterrents to marriage for low-income couples, and do moreto encourage fatherhood -- because what makes you a man isn’t the ability to conceive a
  
child; it’s having the courage to raise one.  And we want to encourage that.  We want to helpthat.
Stronger families.  Stronger communities.  A stronger America.  It is this kind of prosperity --broad, shared, built on a thriving middle class -- that has always been the source of ourprogress at home.  It’s also the foundation of our power and influence throughout the world.
Tonight, we stand united in saluting the troops and civilians who sacrifice every day to protectus.  Because of them, we can say with confidence that America will complete its mission inAfghanistan and achieve our objective of defeating the core of al Qaeda.
Already, we have brought home 33,000 of our brave servicemen and women.  This spring, ourforces will move into a support role, while Afghan security forces take the lead.  Tonight, I canannounce that over the next year, another 34,000 American troops will come home fromAfghanistan.  This drawdown will continue and by the end of next year, our war in Afghanistanwill be over.
Beyond 2014, America’s commitment to a unified and sovereign Afghanistan will endure, butthe nature of our commitment will change.  We're negotiating an agreement with the Afghangovernment that focuses on two missions -- training and equipping Afghan forces so that thecountry does not again slip into chaos, and counterterrorism efforts that allow us to pursuethe remnants of al Qaeda and their affiliates.
Today, the organization that attacked us on 9/11 is a shadow of its former self.  It's true,different al Qaeda affiliates and extremist groups have emerged -- from the Arabian Peninsulato Africa.  The threat these groups pose is evolving.  But to meet this threat, we don’t need tosend tens of thousands of our sons and daughters abroad or occupy other nations.  Instead,we'll need to help countries like Yemen, and Libya, and Somalia provide for their own security,and help allies who take the fight to terrorists, as we have in Mali.  And where necessary,through a range of capabilities, we will continue to take direct action against those terroristswho pose the gravest threat to Americans.
Now, as we do, we must enlist our values in the fight.  That's why my administration hasworked tirelessly to forge a durable legal and policy framework to guide our counterterrorismefforts.  Throughout, we have kept Congress fully informed of our efforts.  I recognize that inour democracy, no one should just take my word for it that we’re doing things the right way. So in the months ahead, I will continue to engage Congress to ensure not only that ourtargeting, detention and prosecution of terrorists remains consistent with our laws and systemof checks and balances, but that our efforts are even more transparent to the Americanpeople and to the world.
Of course, our challenges don’t end with al Qaeda.  America will continue to lead the effort toprevent the spread of the world’s most dangerous weapons.  The regime in North Korea mustknow they will only achieve security and prosperity by meeting their international obligations.
  
Provocations of the sort we saw last night will only further isolate them, as we stand by ourallies, strengthen our own missile defense and lead the world in taking firm action in responseto these threats.
Likewise, the leaders of Iran must recognize that now is the time for a diplomatic solution,because a coalition stands united in demanding that they meet their obligations, and we willdo what is necessary to prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon.
At the same time, we’ll engage Russia to seek further reductions in our nuclear arsenals, andcontinue leading the global effort to secure nuclear materials that could fall into the wronghands -- because our ability to influence others depends on our willingness to lead and meetour obligations.
America must also face the rapidly growing threat from cyber-attacks.  Now, we know hackerssteal people’s identities and infiltrate private emails.  We know foreign countries andcompanies swipe our corporate secrets.  Now our enemies are also seeking the ability tosabotage our power grid, our financial institutions, our air traffic control systems.  We cannotlook back years from now and wonder why we did nothing in the face of real threats to oursecurity and our economy.
And that’s why, earlier today, I signed a new executive order that will strengthen our cyberdefenses by increasing information sharing, and developing standards to protect our nationalsecurity, our jobs, and our privacy.
But now Congress must act as well, by passing legislation to give our government a greatercapacity to secure our networks and deter attacks.  This is something we should be able to getdone on a bipartisan basis.
Now, even as we protect our people, we should remember that today’s world presents not justdangers, not just threats, it presents opportunities.  To boost American exports, supportAmerican jobs and level the playing field in the growing markets of Asia, we intend tocomplete negotiations on a Trans-Pacific Partnership.  And tonight, I’m announcing that wewill launch talks on a comprehensive Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with theEuropean Union -- because trade that is fair and free across the Atlantic supports millions ofgood-paying American jobs.
We also know that progress in the most impoverished parts of our world enriches us all -- notonly because it creates new markets, more stable order in certain regions of the world, butalso because it’s the right thing to do.  In many places, people live on little more than a dollara day.  So the United States will join with our allies to eradicate such extreme poverty in thenext two decades by connecting more people to the global economy; by empowering women;by giving our young and brightest minds new opportunities to serve, and helping communitiesto feed, and power, and educate themselves; by saving the world’s children from preventabledeaths; and by realizing the promise of an AIDS-free generation, which is within our reach.
  
You see, America must remain a beacon to all who seek freedom during this period of historicchange.  I saw the power of hope last year in Rangoon, in Burma, when Aung San Suu Kyiwelcomed an American President into the home where she had been imprisoned for years;when thousands of Burmese lined the streets, waving American flags, including a man whosaid, “There is justice and law in the United States.  I want our country to be like that.”
In defense of freedom, we’ll remain the anchor of strong alliances from the Americas to Africa;from Europe to Asia.  In the Middle East, we will stand with citizens as they demand theiruniversal rights, and support stable transitions to democracy.
We know the process will be messy, and we cannot presume to dictate the course of changein countries like Egypt, but we can -- and will -- insist on respect for the fundamental rights ofall people.  We’ll keep the pressure on a Syrian regime that has murdered its own people, andsupport opposition leaders that respect the rights of every Syrian.  And we will stand steadfastwith Israel in pursuit of security and a lasting peace.
These are the messages I'll deliver when I travel to the Middle East next month.  And all thiswork depends on the courage and sacrifice of those who serve in dangerous places at greatpersonal risk –- our diplomats, our intelligence officers, and the men and women of the UnitedStates Armed Forces.  As long as I’m Commander-in-Chief, we will do whatever we must toprotect those who serve their country abroad, and we will maintain the best military the worldhas ever known.
We'll invest in new capabilities, even as we reduce waste and wartime spending.  We willensure equal treatment for all servicemembers, and equal benefits for their families -- gayand straight. We will draw upon the courage and skills of our sisters and daughters andmoms, because women have proven under fire that they are ready for combat.
We will keep faith with our veterans, investing in world-class care, including mental healthcare, for our wounded warriors -- supporting our military families; giving our veterans thebenefits and education and job opportunities that they have earned.  And I want to thank mywife, Michelle, and Dr. Jill Biden for their continued dedication to serving our military familiesas well as they have served us. Thank you, honey.  Thank you, Jill.
Defending our freedom, though, is not just the job of our military alone.  We must all do ourpart to make sure our God-given rights are protected here at home.  That includes one of themost fundamental right of a democracy:  the right to vote. When any American, no matterwhere they live or what their party, are denied that right because they can’t afford to wait forfive or six or seven hours just to cast their ballot, we are betraying our ideals.
So tonight, I’m announcing a nonpartisan commission to improve the voting experience inAmerica.
  
And it definitely needs improvement.  I’m asking two long-time experts in the field -- who, bythe way, recently served as the top attorneys for my campaign and for Governor Romney’scampaign -- to lead it.  We can fix this, and we will.  The American people demand it, and sodoes our democracy.
Of course, what I’ve said tonight matters little if we don’t come together to protect our mostprecious resource:  our children.  It has been two months since Newtown.  I know this is notthe first time this country has debated how to reduce gun violence.  But this time is different. Overwhelming majorities of Americans -- Americans who believe in the Second Amendment -
- have come together around common-sense reform, like background checks that will make itharder for criminals to get their hands on a gun.  Senators of both parties are workingtogether on tough new laws to prevent anyone from buying guns for resale to criminals. Police chiefs are asking our help to get weapons of war and massive ammunition magazinesoff our streets, because these police chiefs, they’re tired of seeing their guys and gals beingoutgunned.
Each of these proposals deserves a vote in Congress.  Now, if you want to vote no, that’s yourchoice.  But these proposals deserve a vote. Because in the two months since Newtown, morethan a thousand birthdays, graduations, anniversaries have been stolen from our lives by abullet from a gun -- more than a thousand.
One of those we lost was a young girl named Hadiya Pendleton.  She was 15 years old.  Sheloved Fig Newtons and lip gloss.  She was a majorette.  She was so good to her friends theyall thought they were her best friend.  Just three weeks ago, she was here, in Washington,with her classmates, performing for her country at my inauguration.  And a week later, shewas shot and killed in a Chicago park after school, just a mile away from my house.
Hadiya’s parents, Nate and Cleo, are in this chamber tonight, along with more than two dozenAmericans whose lives have been torn apart by gun violence.  They deserve a vote.  Theydeserve a vote.  Gabby Giffords deserves a vote.  The families of Newtown deserve a vote. The families of Aurora deserve a vote. The families of Oak Creek and Tucson and Blacksburg,and the countless other communities ripped open by gun violence –- they deserve a simplevote.  They deserve a simple vote.
Our actions will not prevent every senseless act of violence in this country.  In fact, no laws,no initiatives, no administrative acts will perfectly solve all the challenges I’ve outlinedtonight.  But we were never sent here to be perfect.  We were sent here to make whatdifference we can, to secure this nation, expand opportunity, uphold our ideals through thehard, often frustrating, but absolutely necessary work of self-government.
We were sent here to look out for our fellow Americans the same way they look out for oneanother, every single day, usually without fanfare, all across this country.  We should followtheir example.
  
We should follow the example of a New York City nurse named Menchu Sanchez.  WhenHurricane Sandy plunged her hospital into darkness, she wasn’t thinking about how her ownhome was faring. Her mind was on the 20 precious newborns in her care and the rescue planshe devised that kept them all safe.
We should follow the example of a North Miami woman named Desiline Victor.  When Desilinearrived at her polling place, she was told the wait to vote might be six hours.  And as timeticked by, her concern was not with her tired body or aching feet, but whether folks like herwould get to have their say.  And hour after hour, a throng of people stayed in line to supporther -- because Desiline is 102 years old.  And they erupted in cheers when she finally put on asticker that read, “I voted.”
We should follow the example of a police officer named Brian Murphy.  When a gunmanopened fire on a Sikh temple in Wisconsin and Brian was the first to arrive, he did notconsider his own safety.  He fought back until help arrived and ordered his fellow officers toprotect the safety of the Americans worshiping inside, even as he lay bleeding from 12 bulletwounds.  And when asked how he did that, Brian said, “That’s just the way we’re made.”
That’s just the way we’re made.  We may do different jobs and wear different uniforms, andhold different views than the person beside us.  But as Americans, we all share the sameproud title -- we are citizens.  It’s a word that doesn’t just describe our nationality or legalstatus.  It describes the way we’re made.  It describes what we believe.  It captures theenduring idea that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one anotherand to future generations, that our rights are wrapped up in the rights of others; and that wellinto our third century as a nation, it remains the task of us all, as citizens of these UnitedStates, to be the authors of the next great chapter of our American story.
Thank you.  God bless you, and God bless these United States of America.
