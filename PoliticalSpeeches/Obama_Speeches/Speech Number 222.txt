Good afternoon, everybody.  Earlier today, I was briefed by my homeland security team onthe events in Boston. We’re continuing to monitor and respond to the situation as it unfolds. And I’ve directed the full resources of the federal government to help state and localauthorities protect our people, increase security around the United States as necessary, andinvestigate what happened.
The American people will say a prayer for Boston tonight.  And Michelle and I send ourdeepest thoughts and prayers to the families of the victims in the wake of this senseless loss.
We don’t yet have all the answers.  But we do know that multiple people have been wounded,some gravely, in explosions at the Boston Marathon.
I’ve spoken to FBI Director Mueller and Secretary of Homeland Security Napolitano, andthey’re mobilizing the appropriate resources to investigate and to respond.
I’ve updated leaders of Congress in both parties, and we reaffirmed that on days like thisthere are no Republicans or Democrats -- we are Americans, united in concern for our fellowcitizens.
I’ve also spoken with Governor Patrick and Mayor Menino, and made it clear that they haveevery single federal resource necessary to care for the victims and counsel the families.  Andabove all, I made clear to them that all Americans stand with the people of Boston.
  
Boston police, firefighters, and first responders as well as the National Guard respondedheroically, and continue to do so as we speak.  It’s a reminder that so many Americans serveand sacrifice on our behalf every single day, without regard to their own safety, in dangerousand difficult circumstances.  And we salute all those who assisted in responding so quickly andprofessionally to this tragedy.
We still do not know who did this or why.  And people shouldn’t jump to conclusions before wehave all the facts.  But make no mistake -- we will get to the bottom of this.  And we will findout who did this; we'll find out why they did this.  Any responsible individuals, any responsiblegroups will feel the full weight of justice.
Today is a holiday in Massachusetts -- Patriots’ Day.  It’s a day that celebrates the free andfiercely independent spirit that this great American city of Boston has reflected from the earliest days of our nation.  And it’s a day that draws the world to Boston’s streets in a spiritof friendly competition.  Boston is a tough and resilient town.  So are its people.  I'msupremely confident that Bostonians will pull together, take care of each other, and moveforward as one proud city.  And as they do, the American people will be with them everysingle step of the way.
You should anticipate that as we get more information, our teams will provide you briefings. We're still in the investigation stage at this point.  But I just want to reiterate we will find outwho did this and we will hold them accountable.
Thank you very much.
