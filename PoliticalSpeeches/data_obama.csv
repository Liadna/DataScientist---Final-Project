"On behalf of the great state of Illinois, crossroads of a nation, Land of Lincoln, let me expressmy deepest gratitude for the privilege of addressing this convention. Tonight is a particular honor for me because, let   s face it, my presence on this stage is prettyunlikely. My father was a foreign student, born and raised in a small village in Kenya. He grewup herding goats, went to school in a tin-roof shack. His father -- my grandfather -- was acook, a domestic servant to the British. But my grandfather had larger dreams for his son. Through hard work and perseverance myfather got a scholarship to study in a magical place, America, that shone as a beacon offreedom and opportunity to so many who had come before. While studying here, my father met my mother. She was born in a town on the other side ofthe world, in Kansas. Her father worked on oil rigs and farms through most of the Depression.The day after Pearl Harbor my grandfather signed up for duty; joined Patton   s army, marchedacross Europe. Back home, my grandmother raised a baby and went to work on a bomberassembly line. After the war, they studied on the G.I. Bill, bought a house through F.H.A., andlater moved west all the way to Hawaii in search of opportunity. And they, too, had big dreams for their daughter. A common dream, born of two continents. My parents shared not only an improbable love, they shared an abiding faith in thepossibilities of this nation. They would give me an African name, Barack, or    blessed,   believing that in a tolerant America your name is no barrier to success. They imagined -- Theyimagined me going to the best schools in the land, even though they weren   t rich, because ina generous America you don   t have to be rich to achieve your potential. They're both passed away now. And yet, I know that on this night they look down on me withgreat pride. They stand here, and I stand here today, grateful for the diversity of my heritage, aware thatmy parents    dreams live on in my two precious daughters. I stand here knowing that my storyis part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me,and that, in no other country on earth, is my story even possible. Tonight, we gather to affirm the greatness of our Nation -- not because of the height of ourskyscrapers, or the power of our military, or the size of our economy. Our pride is based on avery simple premise, summed up in a declaration made over two hundred years ago: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they areendowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are Life,Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That is the true genius of America, a faith -- a faith in simple dreams, an insistence on smallmiracles; that we can tuck in our children at night and know that they are fed and clothed andsafe from harm; that we can say what we think, write what we think, without hearing asudden knock on the door; that we can have an idea and start our own business withoutpaying a bribe; that we can participate in the political process without fear of retribution, andthat our votes will be counted -- at least most of the time. This year, in this election we are called to reaffirm our values and our commitments, to holdthem against a hard reality and see how we're measuring up to the legacy of our forbearersand the promise of future generations. And fellow Americans, Democrats, Republicans, Independents, I say to you tonight: We havemore work to do -- more work to do for the workers I met in Galesburg, Illinois, who arelosing their union jobs at the Maytag plant that   s moving to Mexico, and now are having tocompete with their own children for jobs that pay seven bucks an hour; more to do for thefather that I met who was losing his job and choking back the tears, wondering how he wouldpay 4500 dollars a month for the drugs his son needs without the health benefits that hecounted on; more to do for the young woman in East St. Louis, and thousands more like her,who has the grades, has the drive, has the will, but doesn   t have the money to go to college. Now, don   t get me wrong. The people I meet -- in small towns and big cities, in diners andoffice parks -- they don   t expect government to solve all their problems. They know they haveto work hard to get ahead, and they want to. Go into the collar counties around Chicago, andpeople will tell you they don   t want their tax money wasted, by a welfare agency or by thePentagon. Go in -- Go into any inner city neighborhood, and folks will tell you thatgovernment alone can   t teach our kids to learn; they know that parents have to teach, thatchildren can   t achieve unless we raise their expectations and turn off the television sets anderadicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white. They know thosethings. People don   t expect -- People don't expect government to solve all their problems. But theysense, deep in their bones, that with just a slight change in priorities, we can make sure thatevery child in America has a decent shot at life, and that the doors of opportunity remain opento all. They know we can do better. And they want that choice. In this election, we offer that choice. Our Party has chosen a man to lead us who embodiesthe best this country has to offer. And that man is John Kerry. John Kerry understands the ideals of community, faith, and service because they   ve definedhis life. From his heroic service to Vietnam, to his years as a prosecutor and lieutenantgovernor, through two decades in the United States Senate, he's devoted himself to thiscountry. Again and again, we   ve seen him make tough choices when easier ones wereavailable. His values and his record affirm what is best in us. John Kerry believes in an America wherehard work is rewarded; so instead of offering tax breaks to companies shipping jobs overseas,he offers them to companies creating jobs here at home. John Kerry believes in an America where all Americans can afford the same health coverageour politicians in Washington have for themselves. John Kerry believes in energy independence, so we aren   t held hostage to the profits of oilcompanies, or the sabotage of foreign oil fields. John Kerry believes in the Constitutional freedoms that have made our country the envy ofthe world, and he will never sacrifice our basic liberties, nor use faith as a wedge to divide us. And John Kerry believes that in a dangerous world war must be an option sometimes, but itshould never be the first option. You know, a while back -- awhile back I met a young man named Shamus in a V.F.W. Hall inEast Moline, Illinois. He was a good-looking kid -- six two, six three, clear eyed, with an easysmile. He told me he   d joined the Marines and was heading to Iraq the following week. And asI listened to him explain why he   d enlisted, the absolute faith he had in our country and itsleaders, his devotion to duty and service, I thought this young man was all that any of usmight ever hope for in a child. But then I asked myself, ""Are we serving Shamus as well as he is serving us?"" I thought of the 900 men and women -- sons and daughters, husbands and wives, friends andneighbors, who won   t be returning to their own hometowns. I thought of the families I   ve metwho were struggling to get by without a loved one   s full income, or whose loved ones hadreturned with a limb missing or nerves shattered, but still lacked long-term health benefitsbecause they were Reservists. When we send our young men and women into harm   s way, we have a solemn obligation notto fudge the numbers or shade the truth about why they   re going, to care for their familieswhile they   re gone, to tend to the soldiers upon their return, and to never ever go to warwithout enough troops to win the war, secure the peace, and earn the respect of the world. Now -- Now let me be clear. Let me be clear. We have real enemies in the world. Theseenemies must be found. They must be pursued. And they must be defeated. John Kerry knowsthis. And just as Lieutenant Kerry did not hesitate to risk his life to protect the men whoserved with him in Vietnam, President Kerry will not hesitate one moment to use our militarymight to keep America safe and secure. John Kerry believes in America. And he knows that it   s not enough for just some of us toprosper -- for alongside our famous individualism, there   s another ingredient in the Americansaga, a belief that we   re all connected as one people. If there is a child on the south side ofChicago who can   t read, that matters to me, even if it   s not my child. If there is a seniorcitizen somewhere who can   t pay for their prescription drugs, and having to choose betweenmedicine and the rent, that makes my life poorer, even if it   s not my grandparent. If there   san Arab American family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process, thatthreatens my civil liberties. It is that fundamental belief -- It is that fundamental belief: I am my brother   s keeper. I ammy sister   s keeper that makes this country work. It   s what allows us to pursue our individualdreams and yet still come together as one American family. E pluribus unum: ""Out of many, one."" Now even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us -- the spin masters,the negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of ""anything goes."" Well, I say to themtonight, there is not a liberal America and a conservative America -- there is the United Statesof America. There is not a Black America and a White America and Latino America and AsianAmerica -- there   s the United States of America. The pundits, the pundits like to slice-and-dice our country into red states and blue states; redstates for Republicans, blue states for Democrats. But I   ve got news for them, too. Weworship an awesome God in the blue states, and we don   t like federal agents poking around inour libraries in the red states. We coach Little League in the blue states and yes, we   ve gotsome gay friends in the red states. There are patriots who opposed the war in Iraq and thereare patriots who supported the war in Iraq. We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance tothe stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America. In the end -- In the end -- In the end, that   s what this election is about. Do we participate in apolitics of cynicism or do we participate in a politics of hope? John Kerry calls on us to hope. John Edwards calls on us to hope. I   m not talking about blind optimism here -- the almost willful ignorance that thinksunemployment will go away if we just don   t think about it, or the health care crisis will solveitself if we just ignore it. That   s not what I   m talking about. I   m talking about something moresubstantial. It   s the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs; the hope ofimmigrants setting out for distant shores; the hope of a young naval lieutenant bravelypatrolling the Mekong Delta; the hope of a millworker   s son who dares to defy the odds; thehope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him, too. Hope -- Hope in the face of difficulty. Hope in the face of uncertainty. The audacity of hope! In the end, that is God   s greatest gift to us, the bedrock of this nation. A belief in things notseen. A belief that there are better days ahead. I believe that we can give our middle class relief and provide working families with a road toopportunity. I believe we can provide jobs to the jobless, homes to the homeless, and reclaim youngpeople in cities across America from violence and despair. I believe that we have a righteous wind at our backs and that as we stand on the crossroadsof history, we can make the right choices, and meet the challenges that face us. America! Tonight, if you feel the same energy that I do, if you feel the same urgency that Ido, if you feel the same passion that I do, if you feel the same hopefulness that I do -- if wedo what we must do, then I have no doubt that all across the country, from Florida to Oregon,from Washington to Maine, the people will rise up in November, and John Kerry will be swornin as President, and John Edwards will be sworn in as Vice President, and this country willreclaim its promise, and out of this long political darkness a brighter day will come. Thank you very much everybody. God bless you. Thank you.",obama
"Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  President.   Mr.  President,  on  Thursdays  Senator  Durbin  and  I  hold  a  constituent  coffee  so  we  can  hear   from  the  folks  back  home.  A  young  man  came  a  few  months  ago  who  was  about  25,  26  years   old.  He  had  been  back  from  Iraq  for  a  year.  The  first  six  months  of  that  year  had  been  spent   in  a  coma.  An  explosion  had  shattered  his  face,  blinded  him  in  both  eyes,  has  left  him  without   the  use  of  one  arm.   He  talked  to  us  about  how  he  was  going  through  rehab.  He  introduced  us  to  his  family.  He  has   a  wife  and  two  young  daughters  like  I  do,  and  his  wife  talked  for  a  bit  about  the  adjustments   they  were  making  at  home  since  dad  got  hurt.  And  I  found  myself  looking  at  not  just  him,  but   his  wife,  who  loves  him  so  much.  And  I  thought  about  how  their  lives  were  forever  changed   because  of  the  decision  that  was  carried  out  four  years  ago.   The  sacrifices  of  war  are  immeasurable.  I  first  made  this  point  in  the  fall  of  2002,  at  the  end  of   the  speech  that  I  gave  opposing  the  invasion  of  Iraq.  I  said  then  that  I  certainly  do  not  oppose   all  wars.  Rather,  I  oppose  dumb  wars,  rash  wars,  wars  that  are  based  on  passion  as  opposed   to  wars  based  on  a  sober  assessment  of  our  national  security  interests,  because  there's  no   decision  more  profound  than  the  one  we  make  to  send  our  brave  men  and  women  into  harm   s   way. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.  Property  of     Copyright    2010.  All  rights  reserved.   Page  1      I   ve  thought  about  these  words  from  time  to  time  since  that  speech,  but  never  so  much  as  the   day  I  saw  that  young  man  and  his  wife,  and  understood  the  degree  to  which  their  lives  had   been  turn  upside  down.   The  sacrifices  of  war  are  immeasurable.  Too  many  have  returned  from  Iraq  with  that  soldier   s   story        with  broken  bodies  and  shattered  nerves  and  wounds  that  even  the  best  care  may  not   heal.  Too  many  of  our  best  have  come  home  shrouded  in  the  flag  they  loved.  Too  many  moms   and  dads  and  husbands  and  wives  have  answered  that  knock  on  the  door  that   s  hardest  for   any  loved  one  to  hear.  And  the  rest  of  us  have  seen  too  many  promises  of  swift  victories  and   dying  insurgencies  and  budding  democracy  giving  way  to  the  reality  of  a  brutal  civil  war  that   goes  on  and  on  and  on  to  this  day.   The  sacrifices  of  war,  Mr.  President,  are  immeasurable.  It  was  not  impossible  to  see  back  then   that  we  might  arrive  at  the  place  we   re  at  today.  I  said  then  that  a  war  based  not  on  reason   but  on  passion,  not  on  principle  but  on  politics  would  lead  to  a  U.S.  occupation  of   undetermined  length,  at  undetermined  cost,  with  undetermined  consequences.  I  believed  that   an  invasion  of  Iraq  without  a  clear  rationale  or  strong  international  support  would  only   strengthen  the  recruitment  arm  of  al  Qaeda  and  erode  the  good  standing  and  moral  authority   that  took  our  country  generations  to  build.  There  were  other  experts  and  leaders  and   everyday  Americans  who  believed  this  too.   I  wish  I  had  been  wrong.  I  wish  we  weren   t  here  talking  about  this  at  the  beginning  of  the   war   s  fifth  year        because  the  consequences  of  this  war  have  been  profound.  And  the   sacrifices  have  been  immeasurable.   Mr.  President,  those  who  would  have  us  continue  this  war  in  perpetuity  like  to  say  that  this  is   a  matter  of  resolve  on  behalf  of  the  American  people.  But  the  American  people  have  been   extraordinarily  resolved.  They've  seen  their  sons  and  daughters  killed  and  wounded  on  the   streets  of  Fallujah.  They've  spent  hundreds  of  billions  of  dollars  on  this  effort        money  that   could  have  been  devoted  to  strengthening  our  homeland  and  our  competitive  standing  as  a   nation.   It  is  not  a  failure  of  resolve  that  has  led  us  into  this  chaos  but  a  failed  strategy        a  strategy   that  has  only  strengthened  Iran   s  strategic  position,  increased  threats  posed  by  terrorist   organizations,  reduced  U.S.  credibility  and  influence  around  the  world,  and  placed  Israel  and   other  nations  [friendly]  to  the  United  States  in  the  region  in  greater  peril.  Iraq  has  not  been  a   failure  of  resolve    it  has  been  a  failure  of  strategy,  and  that  strategy  must  change.  It  is  time   to  bring  a  responsible  end  to  U.S.  involvement  in  this  conflict  is  now.   It's  become  apparent,  Mr.  President,  that  there's  no  military  solution  to  this  war.  No  amount   of  U.S.  soldiers        not  10,000  more,  not  20,000  more,  not  almost  30,000  more  than  we  know   we  are  sending        can  solve  the  grievances  that  lay  at  the  heart  of  someone  else   s  civil  war. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.  Property  of     Copyright    2010.  All  rights  reserved.   Page  2      Our  troops  cannot  serve  as  their  diplomats,  and  we  can  no  longer  referee  their  civil  war.  We   must  begin  a  phased  withdrawal  of  our  forces  starting  May  1st,  with  the  goal  of  removing  all   combat  forces  by  March  30th,  2008.   We  also  must  make  sure  that  we   re  not  as  careless  getting  out  of  this  war  as  we  were  getting   in,  and  that   s  why  this  withdrawal  should  be  gradual,  and  maintain  some  U.S.  troops  in  the   region  to  prevent  a  wider  war  in  the  region,  while  they  can  also  work  on  going  after  Al  Qaeda   and  other  terrorists.  But  this  phased  withdrawal,  Mr.  President,  must  begin  soon.  Letting  the   Iraqis  know  that  we  will  not  be  there  forever  is  our  last,  best  hope  to  pressure  the  Iraqis  to   take  ownership  of  their  country  and  bring  an  end  to  their  conflict.  It  is  time  for  our  troops  to   start  coming  home.   History  will  not  judge,  Mr.  President,  the  architects  of  this  war  kindly.  But  the  books  have  yet   to  be  written  on  our  effort  to  right  the  wrongs  we  see  in  Iraq.  The  story  has  yet  to  be  told   about  how  we  turned  from  this  moment,  found  our  way  out  of  the  desert,  and  took  to  heart   the  lessons  of  war  that  too  many  refused  to  heed  back  then    for  it  is  of  little  use  or  comfort  to   recall  past  advice  and  warnings  if  we  do  not  allow  them  to  guide  us  in  the  challenges  that  lie   ahead.  Mr.  President,  threats  loom  large  in  an  age  where  terrorist  networks  thrive,  and  there   will  certainly  be  times  when  we  have  to  call  on  our  brave  servicemen  and  women  to  risk  their   lives  again.   But  before  we  make  that  most  profound  of  all  decisions,  before  we  send  our  best  off  to  battle,   we  must  remember  what  led  us  to  this  day  and  learn  from  the  principles  that  follow.   We  must  remember  that  ideology  is  not  a  foreign  policy.  We  must  not  embark  on  a  war  based   on  untested  theories,  political  agendas,  or  wishful  thinking  that  has  little  basis  in  fact  or   reality.  We  must  focus  our  efforts  on  the  threats  we  know  exist,  and  we  must  evaluate  those   threats  with  sound  intelligence  that  is  never  manipulated  for  political  reasons.   Mr.  President,  we  must  remember  that  the  cost  of  going  it  alone  is  immense.  It  is  a  choice  we   sometimes  have  to  make,  but  one  that  must  be  made  rarely  and  always  reluctantly.  That's   because  America   s  standing  in  the  world  is  a  precious  resource  not  easily  rebuilt.  We  value  the   cooperation  and  goodwill  of  other  nations  not  because  it  makes  us  feel  good,  but  because  it   makes  all  the  world  safer    because  the  only  way  to  battle  21st  century  threats  that  race   across  the  borders        threats  like  terror  and  disease  and  nuclear  proliferation        is  to  enlist  the   resources  and  support  of  all  nations.  To  win  our  wider  struggle,  we  must  let  people  across  this   planet  know  that  there  is  another,  more  hopeful  alternative  to  the  hateful  ideologies  the   terrorists  espouse  and  a  renewed  America  will  reflect  and  champion  that  vision.   Mr.  President,  we  must  remember  that  planning  for  peace  is  just  as  critical  as  planning  for   war.  Iraq  was  not  just  a  failure  of  conception  but  a  failure  of  execution,  and  so  when  a  conflict   does  arise  that  requires  our  involvement,  we  must  understand  that  country   s  history,  its   politics,  its  ethnic  and  religious  divisions  before  our  troops  ever  set  foot  on  its  soil. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.  Property  of     Copyright    2010.  All  rights  reserved.   Page  3      We  must  understand  that  setting  up  ballot  boxes  does  not  a  democracy  make        that  real   freedom  and  real  stability  come  from  doing  the  hard  work  of  helping  to  build  a  strong  police   force,  and  a  legitimate  government,  and  ensuring  that  people  have  food,  and  water,  and   electricity,  and  basic  services.  And  we  must  be  honest  about  how  much  of  that  we  can  do   ourselves  and  how  much  must  come  from  the  people  themselves.   Finally,  Mr.  President,  we  must  remember  that  when  we  send  our  servicemen  and  women  to   war,  we  make  sure  we  give  them  the  training  they  need,  and  the  equipment  that  will  keep   them  safe,  and  a  mission  that  they  can  accomplish.  We  must  respect  our  commanders     advice   not  just  when  its  politically  convenient,  but  even  when  it   s  not  what  we  want  to  hear.  And   when  our  troops  come  home,  it  is  our  most  solemn  responsibility  to  make  sure  they  come   home  to  the  services,  and  the  benefits,  and  the  care  they  deserve.   As  we  stand  at  the  beginning  of  the  fifth  year  of  this  war,  Mr.  President,  let  us  remember  that   young  man  from  Illinois,  and  his  wife,  and  his  daughters,  and  the  thousands  upon  thousands   of  families  who  are  living  the  very  real  consequences  and  immeasurable  sacrifices  that  have   come  from  our  decision  to  invade  Iraq.  We  are  so  blessed  in  this  country  to  have  so  many   men  and  women  like  this        Americans  willing  to  put  on  that  uniform,  and  say  the  hard   goodbyes,  and  risk  their  lives  in  a  far  off  land  because  they  know  that  such  consequences  and   sacrifices  are  sometimes  necessary  to  defend  our  country  and  achieve  a  lasting  peace.   That  is  why  we  have  no  greater  responsibility  than  to  ensure  the  decision  to  place  them  in   harm   s  way  is  the  right  one.  And  that  is  why  we  must  learn  the  lessons  of  Iraq.  It  is  what  we   owe  our  soldiers.  It  is  what  we  owe  their  families.  And  it  is  what  we  owe  our  country        now,   and  all  the  days  and  months  to  come.   Thank  you,  Mr.  President.  I  yield  the  floor. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.

"I love you back. [to audience] A little less than one year from today, you will go into the voting booth and you will select thePresident of the United States of America. Now, here   s the good news -- the name George W.Bush will not be on the ballot. The name of my cousin Dick Cheney will not be on the ballot.We   ve been trying to hide that for a long time. Everybody has a black sheep in the family. Theera of Scooter Libby justice, and Brownie incompetence, and Karl Rove politics will finally beover. But the question you   re going to have to ask yourself when you caucus in January and youvote in November is,    What   s next for America?    We are in a defining moment in ourhistory. Our nation is at war. The planet is in peril. The dream that so many generationsfought for feels as if it   s slowly slipping away. We are working harder for less. We   ve neverpaid more for health care or for college. It   s harder to save and it   s harder to retire. And mostof all we   ve lost faith that our leaders can or will do anything about it. We were promised compassionate conservatism and all we got was Katrina and wiretaps. Wewere promised a uniter, and we got a President who could not even lead the half of thecountry that voted for him. We were promised a more ethical and more efficient government,and instead we have a town called Washington that is more corrupt and more wasteful than itwas before. And the only mission that was ever accomplished is to use fear and falsehood totake this country to a war that should have never been authorized and should have neverbeen waged. It is because of these failures that America is listening, intently, to what we say here today --not just Democrats, but Republicans and Independents who   ve lost trust in their government,but want to believe again. And it is because of these failures that we not only have a momentof great challenge, but also a moment of great opportunity. We have a chance to bring thecountry together in a new majority -- to finally tackle problems that George Bush made farworse, but that had festered long before George Bush ever took office -- problems that we   vetalked about year after year after year after year. And that is why the same old Washington textbook campaigns just won   t do in this election. That   s why not answering questions    cause we are afraid our answers won   t be popular justwon   t do. That   s why telling the American people what we think they want to hear instead oftelling the American people what they need to hear just won   t do. Triangulating and poll- driven positions because we   re worried about what Mitt or Rudy might say about us just won   tdo. If we are really serious about wining this election Democrats, we can   t live in fear of losingit. This party -- the party of Jefferson and Jackson, of Roosevelt and Kennedy -- has alwaysmade the biggest difference in the lives of the American people when we led, not by polls, butby principle; not by calculation, but by conviction; when we summoned the entire nation to acommon purpose -- a higher purpose. And I run for the Presidency of the United States ofAmerica because that   s the party America needs us to be right now. A party that offers not just a difference in policies, but a difference in leadership. A party that doesn   t just focus on how to win but why we should. A party that doesn   t just offer change as a slogan, but real, meaningful change -- change thatAmerica can believe in. That   s why I   m in this race. That   s why I am running for the Presidency of the United States ofAmerica -- to offer change that we can believe in. I am in this race to tell the corporate lobbyists that their days of setting the agenda inWashington are over. I have done more than any other candidate in this race to take onlobbyists -- and won. They have not funded my campaign, they will not get a job in my WhiteHouse, and they will not drown out the voices of the American people when I am President. I   m in this race to take those tax breaks away from companies that are moving jobs overseasand put them in the pockets of hard working Americans who deserve it. And I won   t raise theminimum wage every ten years -- I will raise it to keep pace so that workers don   t    fall behind. That is why I am in it. To protect the American worker. To fight for the American worker. I   m in this race because I want to stop talking about the outrage of 47 million Americanswithout health care and start actually doing something about it. I expanded health care inIllinois by bringing Democrats and Republicans together. By taking on the insuranceindustry. And that is how I will make certain that every single American in this country hashealth care they can count on and I won   t do it twenty years from now, I won   t do it ten yearsfrom now, I will do it by the end of my first term as President of the United States of America. I run for president to make sure that every American child has the best education that wehave to offer -- from the day they are born to the day they graduate from college. And I won   tjust talk about how great teachers are -- as President I will reward them for their greatness --by raising salaries and giving them more support. That   s why I   m in this race. I am running for President because I am sick and tired of democrats thinking that the onlyway to look tough on national security is by talking, and acting, and voting like George BushRepublicans. When I am this party   s nominee, my opponent will not be able to say that I voted for the warin Iraq; or that I gave George Bush the benefit of the doubt on Iran; or that I supported Bush- Cheney policies of not talking to leaders that we don   t like. And he will not be able to say thatI wavered on something as fundamental as whether or not it is ok for America to torture --because it is never ok. That   s why I am in it. As President, I will end the war in Iraq. We will have our troops home in sixteen months. I willclose Guantanamo. I will restore habeas corpus. I will finish the fight against Al Qaeda. And Iwill lead the world to combat the common threats of the 21st century -- nuclear weapons andterrorism; climate change and poverty; genocide and disease. And I will send once more amessage to those yearning faces beyond our shores that says,    You matter to us. Your futureis our future. And our moment is now.    America, our moment is now. Our moment is now. I don   t want to spend the next year or thenext four years re-fighting the same fights that we had in the 1990s. I don   t want to pit RedAmerica against Blue America, I want to be the President of the United States of America. And if those Republicans come at me with the same fear-mongering and swift-boating thatthey usually do, then I will take them head on. Because I believe the American people aretired of fear and tired of distractions and tired of diversions. We can make this election notabout fear, but about the future. And that won   t just be a Democratic victory; that will be anAmerican victory. And that is a victory America needs right now. I am not in this race to fulfill some long-held ambitions or because I believe it   s somehowowed to me. I never expected to be here, I always knew this journey was improbable. I   venever been on a journey that wasn   t. I am running in this race because of what Dr. King called   the fierce urgency of now.    Because I believe that there   s such a thing as being too late. And that hour is almost upon us. I don   t want to wake up four years from now and find out that millions of Americans still lackhealth care because we couldn   t take on the insurance industry. I don   t want to see that the oceans have risen a few more inches. The planet has reached apoint of no return because we couldn   t find a way to stop buying oil from dictators. I don   t want to see more American lives put at risk because no one had the judgment or thecourage to stand up against a misguided war before we sent our troops into fight. I don   t want to see homeless veterans on the streets. I don   t want to send another generationof American children to failing schools. I don   t want that future for my daughters. I don   t wantthat future for your sons. I do not want that future for America. I   m in this race for the same reason that I fought for jobs for the jobless and hope for thehopeless on the streets of Chicago; for the same reason I fought for justice and equality as acivil rights lawyer; for the same reason that I fought for Illinois families for over a decade. Because I will never forget that the only reason that I   m standing here today is becausesomebody, somewhere stood up for me when it was risky. Stood up when it was hard. Stoodup when it wasn   t popular. And because that somebody stood up, a few more stood up. Andthen a few thousand stood up. And then a few million stood up. And standing up, with courageand clear purpose, they somehow managed to change the world. That   s why I   m running, Iowa -- to give our children and grandchildren the same chancessomebody gave me. That   s why I   m running, Democrats -- to keep the American Dream alive for those who stillhunger for opportunity, who still thirst for equality. That   s why I   m asking you to stand with me, that   s why I   m asking you to caucus for me,that   s why I am asking you to stop settling for what the cynics say we have to accept. In this election -- in this moment -- let us reach for what we know is possible. A nationhealed. A world repaired. An America that believes again. Thank you very much everybody.",obama
"Thank you, Iowa.You know, they said this day would never come. They said our sights were set too high. They said this country was too divided, too disillusioned to ever come together around acommon purpose. But on this January night, at this defining moment in history, you have done what the cynicssaid we couldn't do. You have done what the state of New Hampshire can do in five days. Youhave done what America can do in this new year, 2008.In lines that stretched around schools and churches, in small towns and in big cities, youcame together as Democrats, Republicans, and independents, to stand up and say that we areone nation. We are one people. And our time for change has come.You said the time has come to move beyond the bitterness and pettiness and anger that'sconsumed Washington; to end the political strategy that's been all about division, and insteadmake it about addition; to build a coalition for change that stretches through red states andblue states; because that's how we'll win in November, and that's how we'll finally meet thechallenges that we face as a nation. Transcription date 2012 by Michael E. Eidenmuller. Copyright Status: Restrictions unknown. We are choosing hope over fear. We're choosing unity over division, and sending a powerfulmessage that change is coming to America.You said the time has come to tell the lobbyists who think their money and their influencespeak louder than our voices that they don't own this government -- we do. And we are hereto take it back.The time has come for a President who will be honest about the choices and the challenges weface, who will listen to you and learn from you, even when we disagree, who won't just tellyou what you want to hear, but what you need to know. And in New Hampshire, if you giveme the same chance that Iowa did tonight, I will be that President for America.I'll be a President who finally makes health care affordable and available to every singleAmerican, the same way I expanded health care in Illinois, by bringing Democrats andRepublicans together to get the job done. I'll be a President who ends the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas and puta middle-class tax cut into the pockets of working Americans who deserve it.I'll be a President who harnesses the ingenuity of farmers and scientists and entrepreneurs tofree this nation from the tyranny of oil once and for all.And I'll be a President who ends this war in Iraq and finally brings our troops home, whorestores our moral standing, who understands that 9/11 is not a way to scare up votes but achallenge that should unite America and the world against the common threats of the 21stcentury -- common threats of terrorism and nuclear weapons, climate change and poverty,genocide and disease.Tonight, we are one step closer to that vision of America because of what you did here inIowa. And so I'd especially like to thank the organizers and the precinct captains, thevolunteers and the staff who made this all possible. And while I'm at it on thank you's, I think it makes sense for me to thank the love of my life,the rock of the Obama family, the closer on the campaign trail: Give it up for Michelle Obama.I know you didn't do this for me. You did this because you believed so deeply in the mostAmerican of ideas -- that in the face of impossible odds, people who love this country canchange it. I know this. I know this because while I may be standing here tonight, I'll never forget thatmy journey began on the streets of Chicago doing what so many of you have done for thiscampaign and all the campaigns here in Iowa: organizing and working and fighting to makepeople's lives just a little bit better.

There aredays of disappointment. But sometimes, just sometimes, there are nights like this: a nightthat, years from now, when we've made the changes we believe in, when more families canafford to see a doctor, when our children -- when Malia and Sasha and your children inherit aplanet that's a little cleaner and safer, when the world sees America differently, and Americasees itself as a nation less divided and more united, you'll be able to look back with pride andsay that this was the moment when it all began.This was the moment when the improbable beat what Washington always said was inevitable.This was the moment when we tore down barriers that have divided us for too long; when werallied people of all parties and ages to a common cause; when we finally gave Americans whohad never participated in politics a reason to stand up and to do so.This was the moment when we finally beat back the politics of fear and doubt and cynicism,the politics where we tear each other down instead of lifting this country up. This was themoment.Years from now, you'll look back and you'll say that this was the moment, this was the placewhere America remembered what it means to hope. For many months, we've been teased,even derided for talking about hope. But we always knew that hope is not blind optimism. It'snot ignoring the enormity of the tasks ahead or the roadblocks that stand in our path.It's not sitting on the sidelines or shirking from a fight. Hope is that thing inside us thatinsists, despite all the evidence to the contrary, that something better awaits us if we havethe courage to reach for it and to work for it and to fight for it.Hope is what I saw in the eyes of the young woman in Cedar Rapids who works the night shiftafter a full day of college and still can't afford health care for a sister who's ill -- a youngwoman who still believes that this country will give her the chance to live out her dreams.Hope is what I heard in the voice of the New Hampshire woman who told me that she hasn'tbeen able to breathe since her nephew left for Iraq -- who still goes to bed each night prayingfor his safe return.Hope is what led a band of colonists to rise up against an empire, what led the greatest ofgenerations to free a continent and heal a nation, what led young women and young men tosit at lunch counters and brave fire hoses and march through Selma and Montgomery forfreedom's cause. Hope is what led me here today. With a father from Kenya, a mother from Kansas, and astory that could only happen in the United States of America. Transcription date 2012 by Michael E. Eidenmuller. Copyright Status: Restrictions unknown. Hope is the bedrock of this nation -- the belief that our destiny will not be written for us, butby us, by all those men and women who are not content to settle for the world as it is, whohave the courage to remake the world as it should be.That is what we started here in Iowa and that is the message we can now carry to NewHampshire and beyond; the same message we had when we were up and when we weredown; the one that can save this country, brick by brick, block by block, calloused hand bycalloused hand; that together, ordinary people can do extraordinary things.Because we are not a collection of red states and blue states. We are the United States ofAmerica. And in this moment, in this election, we are ready to believe again.Thank you, Iowa. Transcription date 2012 by Michael E. Eidenmuller.

"[Introductory remarks] Scripture tells us that when Joshua and the Israelites arrived at the gates of Jericho, theycould not enter. The walls of the city were too steep for any one person to climb. They weretoo strong to be taken down by brute force. And so, the people sat for days, unable to pass onthrough; but God had a plan for His People. He told them to stand together and marchtogether around the city, and on the seventh day he told them that when they heard thesound of the ram   s horn, they should speak with one voice. And, at the chosen hour when thehorn sounded and a chorus of voices cried out together, the mighty walls of Jericho cametumbling down. That   s what scripture tells us. And there are many lessons to take from this passage, just as there are many lessons to takefrom this day, just as there are many memories that fill the space of this church. As I wasthinking about which ones we needed to remember at this hour, my mind went back to thevery beginning of the modern Civil Rights era. Because before Memphis and the mountaintop,before the bridge in Selma and the march on Washington, before Birmingham and thebeatings, the fire hoses, and the loss of those four little girls, before there was King the iconand his magnificent dream, there was King the young preacher and a people who foundthemselves suffering under the yolk of oppression. And on the eve of the bus boycotts in Montgomery, at a time when many were still doubtful about the possibilities of change, a timewhen there were those in the black community who not only mistrusted each other, butmistrusted themselves -- King inspired with words not of anger, but of an urgency, a fierceurgency that still speaks to us today.    Unity,    he said,    is the great need of the hour.       Unityis the great need of the hour.    Unity is how we shall overcome. What Dr. King understood is that if just one person chose to walk instead of ri[de] the bus,those walls of oppression would not be moved. But maybe if a few more decided to walk,those foundations might start to shake. If just a few women were willing to do what RosaParks had been willing to do, maybe the cracks in those walls would start to show. Ifteenagers took rides from North to South, maybe a few bricks would come loose. Maybe ifwhite folks marched because they   d come to understand that their freedom was wrapped up inthe freedom of others, that they too had a stake in the impending battle, the walls wouldbegin to sway, and if enough Americans were awakened to injustice, if they joined togetherNorth and South, rich and poor, Jew and Gentile, then perhaps that wall would come tumblingdown, and justice would flow like waters of righteousness, like a mighty stream.    Unity is thegreat need of the hour.    That   s what Dr. King said. It is the great need of this hour as well,not because it sounds pleasant, not because it makes us feel good, but because it's the onlyway we can overcome the essential deficit that exits in this country. I   m not talking about the budget deficit. I   m not talking about the trade deficit. Talking aboutthe moral deficit in this country. I   m talking about an empathy deficit, the inability torecognize ourselves in one another, to understand that we are our brother   s keeper and oursister   s keeper, that in the words of Dr. King,    We are all tied together in a single garment ofdestiny.    We have an empathy deficit when we   re still sending our children down corridors ofshame, schools in the forgotten corners of America where the color of your skin still affectsthe content of your education. We have a deficit when CEOs are making more in ten minutes than ordinary workers aremaking in an entire year, when families lose their homes so unscrupulous lenders can make aprofit, when mothers can   t afford a doctor when their children are stricken with illness. We have a deficit in this country when we have Scooter Libby justice for some and Jenajustice for others, when our children see hanging nooses from a school yard tree today, in thepresent, in the 21st century. We have a deficit when homeless veterans sleep on the streets of our cities, when innocentsare slaughtered in the deserts of Darfur, when young Americans serve tour after tour aftertour after tour of duty in a war that should have never been authorized and should have neverbeen waged. We have an empathy deficit in this country that has to be closed. We have a deficit when ittakes a breach in the levees to reveal the breach in our compassion, when it takes a terriblestorm to reveal the hungry that God calls on us to feed, the sick that He calls on us to carefor, the least of these that He commands that we treat as our own. So, we have a deficit toclose. We have walls, barriers to justice and equality that must come down, and to do this, weknow that    unity is the great need of the hour.    However, all too often, when we talk about unity in this country, we   ve come to believe that itcan be purchased on the cheap. We   ve come to believe that racial reconciliation can comeeasily; that it   s just a matter of a few ignorant people trapped in the prejudices of the past,and that if the demagogues and those who would exploit our racial divisions will simply goaway then all our problems will be solved. All too often, we seek to ignore the profoundstructural and institutional barriers that stand in the way of insuring opportunity for all of ourchildren, or decent jobs for all of our people, or health care for those who are sick. We offerunity, but we are not willing to pay the price that's required Of course, true unity cannot be so easily purchased. It starts with a change in attitudes. Itstarts with changing our hearts, and changing our minds, broadening our spirit. It   s not easyto stand in somebody else   s shoes. It   s not easy to see past our own differences. We   ve allencountered this in our own lives. What makes it even more difficult is that we have a politicsin this country that seeks to drive us apart, that puts up walls between us. We are told thatthose who differ from us on a few things, differ from us on all things, that our problems arethe fault of those who don   t think like us or look like us or come from where we do. TheWelfare Queen, she   s taking our money. The Immigrant, he   s taking our jobs. The believercondemns the nonbeliever as immoral, and the nonbeliever chides the believer for beingintolerant. And for most of this country   s history, we in the African-American community have been atthe receiving end of man   s inhumanity to man. And all of us understand insidious -- All of usunderstand intimately the insidious role that race still sometimes plays on the job and in theschools, in our health care system, and in our criminal justice system. And yet, if we are honest with ourselves, we must admit that none of our hands are entirelyclean. If we   re honest with ourselves, we'll acknowledge that our own community has notalways been true to King   s vision of a beloved community. If we   re honest with ourselves, wehave to admit that there have been times when we've scorned our gay brothers and sistersinstead of embracing them. The scourge of anti-Semitism has at times revealed itself in ourcommunity. For too long, some of us have seen immigrants only as competitors for jobsinstead of companions in the fight for opportunity. Everyday our politics fuels and exploits thiskind of division across all races and regions, across gender and party. It is played out ontelevision; it is sensationalized by the media. Last week, it crept into the campaign forPresident with charges and countercharges that serve to obscure the issues instead ofilluminating the critical choices we face as a nation. None of our hands are clean. So let us say that on this day of all days, each of us carries with us the task of changing ourhearts and minds. The divisions, the stereotypes, the scapegoating, the ease with which weblame the plight of ourselves on others -- all of that distracts us from the common challengesthat we face, war and poverty, inequality and injustice. We can no longer afford to buildourselves up by tearing each other down. We can no longer afford to traffic in lies or fear orhate. It's the poison that we must purge from our politics, the wall that we must tear downbefore the hour grows too late. Because if Dr. King could love his jailer, if he could call on thefaithful, who once sat where you do, to forgive those who had set dogs and fire hoses uponthem, then surely we can look past what divides us in our time and bind up our wounds anderase the sympathy deficit that exists in our hearts. But if changing our hearts and our minds is the first critical step, we cannot stop there. It   snot enough to bemoan the plight of the poor in this country and remain unwilling to push ourelected officials to provide the resources to fix our schools. It's not enough to decry thedisparities of health care and yet allow the insurance companies and the drug companies toblock real reform in our health care system. It   s not enough -- It   s not enough for us to abhorthe costs of a misguided war, and yet we continue to allow ourselves to be driven by a politicsof fear that sees the threat of an attack as a way to scare up votes instead of a call to cometogether in a common effort. Scripture tells us that we are judged not just by word but by deed. And if we are truly to bringabout the unity that is needed, that is so crucial in this time, we have to find it withinourselves to act on what we know, to understand that living up to this country   s ideals and itspossibilities is going to require great effort and great resources, sacrifice and stamina. Wecan   t pass a law called No Child Left Behind and then leave the money behind. That is not aserious effort in bringing about the unity that is needed. We can   t celebrate Dr. King   s dream,and yet still have insufficient funds to cash that promissory note that was promised at thebeginning of this nation. That is what is at stake in this great debate we are having today. Changes that are neededare not just a matter of tinkering around the edges. They will not come if politicians simply tellus what we want to hear. All of us will be called upon to make some sacrifice. None of us willbe exempt from responsibility. We've had to fight to fix our schools, but we also have tochallenge ourselves to be better parents, and turn off the television set, and put away thevideo game, and our men have to be home with our children. That, too, is part of thechallenge that we must make. We will have to confront the biases in our criminal justice system, but we also have toacknowledge the deep-seeded violence that still resides in our own communities, in too manyof the hearts of our young people, and we have to break the grip of that violence wherever wesee it. That   s how we   re going to bring about the change that we seek. That   s how Dr. King ledthis country through the wilderness. He did it with words, words that he spoke not just to the children of slaves but the children ofslave owners, words that inspired not just black but also white, not just Christian but also Jewand Muslim and Buddhists and Atheists, not just the southerner but also the northerner. Heled with words, but he also led with deeds. He also led by example. He led by marching andgoing to jail and suffering threats and beatings and being away from his family. He led bytaking a stand against a war knowing full well that it would diminish his popularity. He led bychallenging our economic structures, understanding that it would cause discomfort. Dr. Kingunderstood that unity cannot be won on the cheap, that we would have to earn it throughgreat effort and determination. That   s the unity, the hard earned unity that we need rightnow. That is the effort, the determination that can transform blind optimism into hope. You know people have remarked on the fact that I talk about hope a lot in my campaign. Youknow they -- they tease me a little bit. Some have been scornful. They say,    Ah, he   s talkingabout hope again. He   s so idealistic. He   s so na  ve. He   s a hope monger.    That   s okay. It   strue. I talk about hope. I talk about it a lot because the odds of me standing here today are sosmall, so remote that I couldn   t of gotten here without some hope. You know my -- my daddyleft me when I was two years old. I needed some hope to get here. I was raised by a singlemother. I needed some hope to get here. I got in trouble when I was a teenager, did somethings folks now like to talk about. I needed some hope to get here. I wasn   t born into money,or great wealth, or great privilege, or status. I was given love, an education, and some hope.That   s what I got. That   s my birthright. So I talk about hope. I -- I put    Hope    on my campaign signs. It doesn   t even have my nameon them sometimes -- just says    Hope.    Folks don   t know who they   re voting for, but it makesthem feel good. Say, you know, huh? I spoke about hope at the Democratic Convention. I -- Iwrote a book called The Audacity of Hope. And so I -- so I   m puzzled when -- when somepeople, some of the other candidates make a mockery of the idea. They say I   m pedaling falsehopes. ""Get a reality check,"" they tell me. And I have to -- I have to try to understand whatthey're saying. The implication is is that if you are hopeful, that you somehow must beengaging in wishful thinking. Your -- Your head must be in the clouds; that you must bepassive and just sit back and wait for things to happen to you. That seems to be theimplication. And so I have to explain to people that   s not what hope is. Hope is not blind optimism. Hope isnot ignorance of the barriers and hurdles and hazards that stand in your way. Hope   s just theopposite. I know how hard it will be to provide health care to every single American. Theinsurance companies, drug companies, they don   t want to give up their profits. I know it won   tbe easy to have a energy policy that makes sense for America because the oil companies likewriting the energy bills. I know that alleviating poverty, or making sure all our children canlearn, or eliminating the scourge of racism in our society -- none of those things lendthemselves to simple solutions. I know because I fought on the streets as a community organizer in poor neighborhoods onthe Southside of Chicago alongside those without jobs or without prospects for the future. Ihave fought in the courts as a civil rights attorney for those who had been denied opportunityon the job or denied access to the ballot box. I   ve seen good legislation die because -- Well,I   ve seen that too -- I   ve seen good legislation die because good intentions weren   t enough,because they weren   t fortified with a political majority and political will. I   ve seen this country-- this country   s judgment clouded by fear. I know how easily a country can be misled when itis afraid. I know how hard it is. Everybody here understands how difficult it is to bring abouttrue change, change that we can believe in. But I also know this -- that nothing in this countryworthwhile has ever happened except somebody somewhere decided to hope. That   s how this country was founded because a group of patriots decided they were going totake on the British Empire. Nobody was putting their money on them. That   s how slaves andabolitionists resisted that evil system. That   s how a new President was able to chart a courseto insure that this nation would no longer remain half slave and half free. That   s how thegreatest generation defeated Fascism and overcame a Great Depression. That   s how womenwon the right to vote. That   s how workers won the right to organize. That   s how young peopleand old people and middle-aged folks were willing to walk instead of ride the bus, and folkscame down on Freedom Rides. They marched, and they sat in, and they were beaten and firehouses were sent on them, and dogs were sent on them, and some went to jail, and somedied for freedom's cause. That   s what hope is. Imagining and then fighting for and strugglingfor and sometimes dying for what didn   t seem possible before. There   s nothing na  ve aboutthat. There are no false hopes in that. I don   t believe in false hopes. Imagine if John F. Kennedy had looked up at the moon andsaid, ""Well, that   s too far."" False hopes, we can   t go there. If Dr. King had stood on the LincolnMemorial and said, ""Y   all go home; we can   t overcome."" There   s no such thing as false hopes,but what I know deep in my heart is that we cannot bring about change unless we are unified,unless we do it together. Change does not happen from the top down -- in America oranywhere else. It happens from the bottom up. It happens because ordinary people dreamextraordinary things. It   s because all of you decide that change must come. That I know. It wasn   t just one voice -- It wasn't just one voice that shouted out before the walls of Jericho.All the voices came together, a chorus of voices. That   s what gives me hope: not just thosewho ascend to high office, but the changes that are happening in ordinary places. The storiesthat give me my hope don   t happen in the spotlight. When I think about Dr. King, I suspect hewas sustained not by having dinner with Presidents; not by getting the Nobel Peace Prize; butcoming back to church and seeing the mothers of the church and the deacons. Those whomaintained their dignity were standing up straight in the face of injustice. That   s where hedrew his hope. He saw God in their faces. Those stories don   t happen on a presidential stage;they happen in the quiet quarters of our lives. They happen in the moments we least expect.So, let me close by giving an example of one of those stories. There is a young woman, 23 years old, white woman, named Ashley Baia, who organizes forour campaign in Florence, South Carolina. Ashley has been working to organize mostly blackfolks. She   s in Florence, South Carolina. She   s been doing it since the beginning of thecampaign, and the other day she...set up a round table discussion where everyone aroundwas telling their story about who they were and why they were there. And so, Ashleyexplained, she started things off, by explaining why she was there. And she explained thatwhen she was nine years old her mother got cancer, and because she had to miss a day ofwork she was let go; and she lost her health care; and then she had to file for bankruptcy.They were on hard times, and that   s when Ashley, nine-years-old at the time, decided she hadto do something to help her mom, and she knew that food was one of their most expensivecosts. They didn   t have a lot of money. Ashley lived in a poor household. And so Ashley convinced her mother that she really liked and really wanted to eat more thananything else mustard and relish sandwiches. She had heard that condiments like mustardand relish were cheap. And she -- she concocted in her own mind at the age of nine that shewould convince her mother that that   s the only thing she wanted to eat everyday, because shefigured that would be a way of saving money for the family and helping them alleviate theirhardships. So she did this for a year until her mom got better. And in that round table she toldeveryone that the reason she joined our campaign was so that she could help millions of otherchildren in the country who want and need to help their parents too. She had heard me speakabout my mother having cancer and having to worry about maybe not getting the health careshe needed because of a preexisting condition, and she had connected with that. She thought,maybe Barack would fight for my mother. And if he would fight for my mother, then maybe Iwill fight alongside him. That   s what had brought her to Florence. So Ashley finishes her story and then goes around the room and asks everyone else whythey   re supporting the campaign. They all have different stories and different reasons: somebring up specific issues; some talk about, upset about, affirmative action; some talk about,you know, ""I want to see more jobs in the community""; some are frustrated about trade;some just like me. So they all got a bunch of different reasons, and finally, at the end of this discussion, theycome to this elderly black man. He   s been sitting there quiet the whole time, hasn   t beensaying a word. And Ashley asks him why is he there. And he doesn   t bring up a specific issue.He does not say healthcare or the economy. He doesn   t talk about the Iraq War. He doesn   tsay anything about education. He doesn   t say that he   s there because he likes Barack Obama,or he   s proud of the possibility of the first African American President. He simply says toeveryone in the room,    I am here because of Ashley. I am here because of this young girl,and the fact that she's willing to fight for what she believes in. And that reminds me that I stillhave some fight left in me, and I   m going stand up for what I believe in.    Now, by itself, that single moment of recognition between that young white girl and that oldblack man, that   s not enough to change a country. By itself, it   s not enough to give healthcare to the sick or jobs to the jobless or education to our children, but it is where we begin. It   s why I believe that the walls in that room began to shake at that moment. And if they canshake in that room, then they can shake here in Atlanta, and if they can shake in Atlanta,then they can shake in the state of Georgia, and if they can shake in Georgia, they can shakeall across America. And if enough of our voices join together, if we see each other in eachother   s eyes, we can bring those walls tumbling down. The walls of Jericho can finally cometumbling down. That is our hope, but only if we pray together, if we work together, and if we march together.Ebenezer, we cannot walk alone. Brothers and sisters, we cannot walk alone. In the strugglefor justice and for equality, we cannot walk alone. In the struggle for opportunity and justice,we cannot walk alone. In the struggle to heal this nation and repair the world, we cannot walkalone. So I ask you to walk with me and march with me and join your voices with mine, andtogether we will sing the song that tears down the walls that divide us and lift up an Americathat is truly indivisible with liberty and justice for all. May God bless the memory of the great pastor of this church. And may God bless the United States of America. Thank you. Thank you.",obama
"Let me begin by thanking Harris Wofford for his contributions to this country. In so manydifferent ways, he exemplifies what we mean by the word ""citizen."" And so we are verygrateful to him for all the work he has done; and I'm thankful for the gracious and thoughtfulintroduction. ""We the people, in order to form a more perfect union."" Two hundred and twenty one yearsago, in a hall that still stands across the street, a group of men gathered and, with thesesimple words, launched America's improbable experiment in democracy. Farmers andscholars, statesmen and patriots who had traveled across the ocean to escape tyranny andpersecution finally made real their Declaration of Independence at a Philadelphia conventionthat lasted through the spring of 1787. The document they produced was eventually signed, but ultimately unfinished. It was stainedby this nation's original sin of slavery, a question that divided the colonies and brought theconvention to a stalemate until the founders chose to allow the slave trade to continue for atleast 20 more years, and to leave any final resolution to future generations. Of course, theanswer to the slavery question was already embedded within our Constitution -- aConstitution that had at is very core the ideal of equal citizenship under the law; aConstitution that promised its people liberty and justice, and a union that could be and shouldbe perfected over time. And yet words on a parchment would not be enough to deliver slaves from bondage, orprovide men and women of every color and creed their full rights and obligations as citizens ofthe United States. What would be needed were Americans in successive generations who werewilling to do their part -- through protests and struggles, on the streets and in the courts,through a civil war and civil disobedience, and always at great risk -- to narrow that gapbetween the promise of our ideals and the reality of their time. This was one of the tasks we set forth at the beginning of this presidential campaign: tocontinue the long march of those who came before us, a march for a more just, more equal,more free, more caring, and more prosperous America. I chose to run for President at thismoment in history because I believe deeply that we cannot solve the challenges of our timeunless we solve them together, unless we perfect our union by understanding that we mayhave different stories, but we hold common hopes; that we may not look the same and maynot have come from the same place, but we all want to move in the same direction: towards abetter future for our children and our grandchildren. And this belief comes from my unyieldingfaith in the decency and generosity of the American people. But it also comes from my ownstory. I'm the son of a black man from Kenya and a white woman from Kansas. I was raised with thehelp of a white grandfather who survived a Depression to serve in Patton's army during WorldWar II, and a white grandmother who worked on a bomber assembly line at Fort Leavenworthwhile he was overseas. I've gone to some of the best schools in America and I've lived in oneof the world's poorest nations. I am married to a black American who carries within her theblood of slaves and slave owners, an inheritance we pass on to our two precious daughters. Ihave brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews, uncles, and cousins of every race and every huescattered across three continents. And for as long as I live, I will never forget that in no othercountry on earth is my story even possible. It's a story that hasn't made me the mostconventional of candidates. But it is a story that has seared into my genetic makeup the ideathat this nation is more than the sum of its parts -- that out of many, we are truly one. Now throughout the first year of this campaign, against all predictions to the contrary, we sawhow hungry the American people were for this message of unity. Despite the temptation toview my candidacy through a purely racial lens, we won commanding victories in states withsome of the whitest populations in the country. In South Carolina, where the Confederate flagstill flies, we built a powerful coalition of African Americans and white Americans. This is not tosay that race has not been an issue in this campaign. At various stages in the campaign, somecommentators have deemed me either ""too black"" or ""not black enough."" We saw racialtensions bubble to the surface during the week before the South Carolina primary. The presshas scoured every single exit poll for the latest evidence of racial polarization, not just interms of white and black, but black and brown as well. And yet, it's only been in the last couple of weeks that the discussion of race in this campaignhas taken a particularly divisive turn. On one end of the spectrum, we've heard the implicationthat my candidacy is somehow an exercise in affirmative action; that it's based solely on thedesire of wild and wide-eyed liberals to purchase racial reconciliation on the cheap. On theother end, we've heard my former pastor, Jeremiah Wright, use incendiary language toexpress views that have the potential not only to widen the racial divide, but views thatdenigrate both the greatness and the goodness of our nation and that rightly offend white andblack alike. Now I've already condemned, in unequivocal terms, the statements of Reverend Wright thathave caused such controversy, and in some cases, pain. For some, nagging questions remain:Did I know him to be an occasionally fierce critic of American domestic and foreign policy? Ofcourse. Did I ever hear him make remarks that could be considered controversial while I sat inthe church? Yes. Did I strongly disagree with many of his political views? Absolutely, just asI'm sure many of you have heard remarks from your pastors, priests, or rabbis with which youstrongly disagree. But the remarks that have caused this recent firestorm weren't simply controversial. Theyweren't simply a religious leader's efforts to speak out against perceived injustice. Instead,they expressed a profoundly distorted view of this country, a view that sees white racism asendemic and that elevates what is wrong with America above all that we know is right withAmerica; a view that sees the conflicts in the Middle East as rooted primarily in the actions ofstalwart allies like Israel instead of emanating from the perverse and hateful ideologies ofradical Islam. As such, Reverend Wright's comments were not only wrong but divisive, divisive at a timewhen we need unity; racially charged at a time when we need to come together to solve a setof monumental problems: two wars, a terrorist threat, a falling economy, a chronic healthcare crisis, and potentially devastating climate change -- problems that are neither black orwhite or Latino or Asian, but rather problems that confront us all. Given my background, my politics, and my professed values and ideals, there will no doubt bethose for whom my statements of condemnation are not enough. Why associate myself withReverend Wright in the first place, they may ask? Why not join another church? And I confessthat if all that I knew of Reverend Wright were the snippets of those sermons that have run inan endless loop on the television sets and YouTube, if Trinity United Church of Christconformed to the caricatures being peddled by some commentators, there is no doubt that Iwould react in much the same way. But the truth is, that isn't all that I know of the man. The man I met more than twenty yearsago is a man who helped introduce me to my Christian faith, a man who spoke to me aboutour obligations to love one another, to care for the sick and lift up the poor. He is a man who served his country as a United States Marine, and who has studied andlectured at some of the finest universities and seminaries in the country, and who over 30years has led a church that serves the community by doing God's work here on Earth -- byhousing the homeless, ministering to the needy, providing day care services and scholarshipsand prison ministries, and reaching out to those suffering from HIV/AIDS. In my first book, Dreams From My Father, I described the experience of my first service atTrinity, and it goes as follows: People began to shout, to rise from their seats and clap and cry out, a forceful windcarrying the reverend's voice up to the rafters. And in that single note -- hope -- I heard something else; at the foot of that cross,inside the thousands of churches across the city, I imagined the stories of ordinaryblack people merging with the stories of David and Goliath, Moses and Pharaoh, theChristians in the lion's den, Ezekiel's field of dry bones. Those stories of survival and freedom and hope became our stories, my story. Theblood that spilled was our blood; the tears our tears; until this black church, on thisbright day, seemed once more a vessel carrying the story of a people into futuregenerations and into a larger world. Our trials and triumphs became at once uniqueand universal, black and more than black. In chronicling our journey, the stories andsongs gave us a meaning to reclaim memories that we didn't need to feel shame about-- memories that all people might study and cherish and with which we could start torebuild. That has been my experience at Trinity. Like other predominantly black churches across thecountry, Trinity embodies the black community in its entirety -- the doctor and the welfaremom, the model student and the former gang-banger. Like other black churches, Trinity'sservices are full of raucous laughter and sometimes bawdy humor. They are full of dancingand clapping and screaming and shouting that may seem jarring to the untrained ear. Thechurch contains in full the kindness and cruelty, the fierce intelligence and the shockingignorance, the struggles and successes, the love and, yes, the bitterness and biases thatmake up the black experience in America. And this helps explain, perhaps, my relationship with Reverend Wright. As imperfect as hemay be, he has been like family to me. He strengthens my faith, officiated my wedding, andbaptized my children. Not once in my conversations with him have I heard him talk about anyethnic group in derogatory terms or treat whites with whom he interacted with anything butcourtesy and respect. He contains within him the contradictions -- the good and the bad -- ofthe community that he has served diligently for so many years. I can no more disown him than I can disown the black community. I can no more disown himthan I can disown my white grandmother, a woman who helped raise me, a woman whosacrificed again and again for me, a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything inthis world, but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed her by on thestreet, and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that mademe cringe. These people are part of me. And they are part of America, this country that I love. Now, some will see this as an attempt to justify or excuse comments that are simplyinexcusable. I can assure you it is not. And I suppose the politically safe thing to do would beto move on from this episode and just hope that it fades into the woodwork. We can dismissReverend Wright as a crank or a demagogue, just as some have dismissed Geraldine Ferraroin the aftermath of her recent statements as harboring some deep -- deep-seated bias. But race is an issue that I believe this nation cannot afford to ignore right now. We would bemaking the same mistake that Reverend Wright made in his offending sermons aboutAmerica: to simplify and stereotype and amplify the negative to the point that it distortsreality. The fact is that the comments that have been made and the issues that have surfacedover the last few weeks reflect the complexities of race in this country that we've never reallyworked through, a part of our union that we have not yet made perfect. And if we walk awaynow, if we simply retreat into our respective corners, we will never be able to come togetherand solve challenges like health care or education or the need to find good jobs for everyAmerican. Understanding -- Understanding this reality requires a reminder of how we arrived at thispoint. As William Faulkner once wrote, ""The past isn't dead and buried. In fact, it isn't evenpast."" We do not need to recite here the history of racial injustice in this country. But we doneed to remind ourselves that so many of the disparities that exist between the African- American community and the larger American community today can be traced directly toinequalities passed on from an earlier generation that suffered under the brutal legacy ofslavery and Jim Crow. Segregated schools were, and are, inferior schools. We still haven'tfixed them, 50 years after Brown versus Board of Education. And the inferior education theyprovided, then and now, helps explain the pervasive achievement gap between today's blackand white students. Legalized discrimination, where blacks were prevented, often through violence, from owningproperty, or loans were not granted to African-American business owners, or blackhomeowners could not access FHA mortgages, or blacks were excluded from unions, or thepolice force, or the fire department meant that black families could not amass any meaningfulwealth to bequeath to future generations. That history helps explain the wealth and incomegap between blacks and whites and the concentrated pockets of poverty that persist in somany of today's urban and rural communities. A lack of economic opportunity among black men and the shame and frustration that camefrom not being able to provide for one's family contributed to the erosion of black families, aproblem that welfare policies for many years may have worsened. And the lack of basicservices in so many urban black neighborhoods -- parks for kids to play in, police walking thebeat, regular garbage pick-up, building code enforcement -- all helped create a cycle ofviolence, blight, and neglect that continues to haunt us. This is the reality in which Reverend Wright and other African-Americans of his generationgrew up. They came of age in the late '50s and early '60s, a time when segregation was stillthe law of the land and opportunity was systematically constricted. What's remarkable is nothow many failed in the face of discrimination, but how many men and women overcame theodds, how many were able to make a way out of no way for those like me who would comeafter them. But for all those who scratched and clawed their way to get a piece of the American Dream,there were many who didn't make it -- those who were ultimately defeated, in one way oranother, by discrimination. That legacy of defeat was passed on to future generations -- thoseyoung men and increasingly young women who we see standing on street corners orlanguishing in our prisons, without hope or prospects for the future. Even for those blacks whodid make it, questions of race, and racism, continue to define their world view in fundamentalways. For the men and women of Reverend Wright's generation, the memories of humiliationand doubt and fear have not gone away, nor has the anger and the bitterness of those years. That anger may not get expressed in public, in front of white co-workers or white friends, butit does find voice in the barbershop or the beauty shop or around the kitchen table. At times,that anger is exploited by politicians to gin up votes along racial lines or to make up for apolitician's own failings. And occasionally it finds voice in the church on Sunday morning, inthe pulpit and in the pews. The fact that so many people are surprised to hear that anger insome of Reverend Wright's sermons simply reminds us of that old truism that the mostsegregated hour of American life occurs on Sunday morning. That -- That anger is not always productive. Indeed, all too often it distracts attention fromsolving real problems. It keeps us from squarely facing our own complicity within the African- American community in our own condition. It prevents the African-American community fromforging the alliances it needs to bring about real change. But the anger is real; it is powerful,and to simply wish it away, to condemn it without understanding its roots only serves towiden the chasm of misunderstanding that exists between the races. In fact, a similar anger exists within segments of the white community. Most working andmiddle-class white Americans don't feel that they've been particularly privileged by their race.Their experience is the immigrant experience. As far as they're concerned, no one handedthem anything; they built it from scratch. They've worked hard all their lives, many times onlyto see their jobs shipped overseas or their pensions dumped after a lifetime of labor. They areanxious about their futures, and they feel their dreams slipping away. And in an era of stagnant wages and global competition, opportunity comes to be seen as azero sum game, in which your dreams come at my expense. So when they are told to bustheir children to a school across town, when they hear that an African American is getting anadvantage in landing a good job or a spot in a good college because of an injustice that theythemselves never committed, when they're told that their fears about crime in urbanneighborhoods are somehow prejudice, resentment builds over time. Like the anger within the black community, these resentments aren't always expressed inpolite company. But they have helped shape the political landscape for at least a generation.Anger over welfare and affirmative action helped forge the Reagan Coalition. Politiciansroutinely exploited fears of crime for their own electoral ends. Talk show hosts andconservative commentators built entire careers unmasking bogus claims of racism whiledismissing legitimate discussions of racial injustice and inequality as mere political correctnessor reverse racism. And just as black anger often proved counterproductive, so have thesewhite resentments distracted attention from the real culprits of the middle class squeeze: acorporate culture rife with inside dealing, questionable accounting practices, and short-termgreed; a Washington dominated by lobbyists and special interests; economic policies thatfavor the few over the many. And yet, to wish away the resentments of white Americans, tolabel them as misguided or even racist without recognizing they are grounded in legitimateconcerns, this, too, widens the racial divide and blocks the path to understanding. This is where we are right now. It's a racial stalemate we've been stuck in for years. And contrary to the claims of some of mycritics, black and white, I have never been so naive as to believe that we can get beyond ourracial divisions in a single election cycle or with a single candidate, particularly -- particularly acandidacy as imperfect as my own. But I have asserted a firm conviction, a conviction rootedin my faith in God and my faith in the American people, that, working together, we can movebeyond some of our old racial wounds and that, in fact, we have no choice -- we have nochoice if we are to continue on the path of a more perfect union. For the African-American community, that path means embracing the burdens of our pastwithout becoming victims of our past. It means continuing to insist on a full measure of justicein every aspect of American life. But it also means binding our particular grievances, for betterhealth care and better schools and better jobs, to the larger aspirations of all Americans -- thewhite woman struggling to break the glass ceiling, the white man who's been laid off, theimmigrant trying to feed his family. And it means also taking full responsibility for our ownlives -- by demanding more from our fathers, and spending more time with our children, andreading to them, and teaching them that while they may face challenges and discrimination intheir own lives, they must never succumb to despair or cynicism. They must always believe --They must always believe that they can write their own destiny. Ironically, this quintessentially American -- and, yes, conservative -- notion of self-help foundfrequent expression in Reverend Wright's sermons. But what my former pastor too often failedto understand is that embarking on a program of self-help also requires a belief that societycan change. The profound mistake of Reverend Wright's sermons is not that he spoke aboutracism in our society. It's that he spoke as if our society was static, as if no progress had beenmade, as if this country -- a country that has made it possible for one of his own members torun for the highest office in the land and build a coalition of white and black, Latino, Asian,rich, poor, young and old -- is still irrevocably bound to a tragic past. What we know, what wehave seen, is that America can change. That is true genius of this nation. What we havealready achieved gives us hope -- the audacity to hope -- for what we can and must achievetomorrow. Now, in the white community, the path to a more perfect union means acknowledging thatwhat ails the African-American community does not just exist in the minds of black people;that the legacy of discrimination -- and current incidents of discrimination, while less overtthan in the past -- that these things are real and must be addressed. Not just with words, butwith deeds -- by investing in our schools and our communities; by enforcing our civil rightslaws and ensuring fairness in our criminal justice system; by providing this generation withladders of opportunity that were unavailable for previous generations. It requires allAmericans to realize that your dreams do not have to come at the expense of my dreams,that investing in the health, welfare, and education of black and brown and white children willultimately help all of America prosper. In the end, then, what is called for is nothing more and nothing less than what all the world'sgreat religions demand: that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us. Let us beour brother's keeper, Scripture tells us. Let us be our sister's keeper. Let us find that commonstake we all have in one another, and let our politics reflect that spirit as well. For we have a choice in this country. We can accept a politics that breeds division and conflictand cynicism. We can tackle race only as spectacle, as we did in the O.J. trial; or in the wakeof tragedy, as we did in the aftermath of Katrina; or as fodder for the nightly news. We canplay Reverend Wright's sermons on every channel every day and talk about them from nowuntil the election, and make the only question in this campaign whether or not the Americanpeople think that I somehow believe or sympathize with his most offensive words. We canpounce on some gaffe by a Hillary supporter as evidence that she's playing the race card; orwe can speculate on whether white men will all flock to John McCain in the general electionregardless of his policies. We can do that. But if we do, I can tell you that in the next election,we'll be talking about some other distraction, and then another one, and then another one.And nothing will change. That is one option. Or, at this moment, in this election, we can come together and say, ""Not this time."" This timewe want to talk about the crumbling schools that are stealing the future of black children andwhite children and Asian children and Hispanic children and Native-American children. Thistime we want to reject the cynicism that tells us that these kids can't learn; that those kidswho don't look like us are somebody else's problem. The children of America are not ""thosekids,"" -- they are our kids, and we will not let them fall behind in a 21st-century economy. Notthis time. This time we want to talk about how the lines in the emergency room are filled withwhites and blacks and Hispanics who do not have health care, who don't have the power ontheir own to overcome the special interests in Washington, but who can take them on if we doit together. This time we want to talk about the shuttered mills that once provided a decent life for menand women of every race, and the homes for sale that once belonged to Americans fromevery religion, every region, every walk of life. This time we want to talk about the fact thatthe real problem is not that someone who doesn't look like you might take your job; it's thatthe corporation you work for will ship it overseas for nothing more than a profit. This time --This time we want to talk about the men and women of every color and creed who servetogether, and fight together, and bleed together under the same proud flag. We want to talkabout how to bring them home from a war that should've never been authorized andshould've never been waged. And we want to talk about how we'll show our patriotism bycaring for them, and their families, and giving them the benefits that they have earned. I would not be running for President if I didn't believe with all my heart that this is what thevast majority of Americans want for this country. This union may never be perfect, butgeneration after generation has shown that it can always be perfected. And today, whenever Ifind myself feeling doubtful or cynical about this possibility, what gives me the most hope isthe next generation -- the young people whose attitudes and beliefs and openness to changehave already made history in this election. There's one story in particular that I'd like to leave you with today, a story I told when I hadthe great honor of speaking on Dr. King's birthday at his home church, Ebenezer Baptist, inAtlanta. There's a young, 23-year-old woman, a white woman named Ashley Baia, whoorganized for our campaign in Florence, South Carolina. She'd been working to organize amostly African-American community since the beginning of this campaign, and one day shewas at a roundtable discussion where everyone went around telling their story and why theywere there. And Ashley said that when she was 9 years old, her mother got cancer. Andbecause she had to miss days of work, she was let go and lost her health care. They had tofile for bankruptcy, and that's when Ashley decided that she had to do something to help hermom. She knew that food was one of their most expensive costs, and so Ashley convinced hermother that what she really liked and really wanted to eat more than anything else wasmustard and relish sandwiches -- because that was the cheapest way to eat. That's the mindof a 9 year old. She did this for a year until her mom got better. And so Ashley told everyone at theroundtable that the reason she had joined our campaign was so that she could help themillions of other children in the country who want and need to help their parents too. Now, Ashley might have made a different choice. Perhaps somebody told her along the waythat the source of her mother's problems were blacks who were on welfare and too lazy towork, or Hispanics who were coming into the country illegally. But she didn't. She sought outallies in her fight against injustice. Anyway, Ashley finishes her story and then goes around the room and asks everyone else whythey're supporting the campaign. They all have different stories and different reasons. Manybring up a specific issue. And finally they come to this elderly black man who's been sittingthere quietly the entire time. And Ashley asks him why he's there. And he doesn't bring up aspecific issue. He does not say health care or the economy. He does not say education or thewar. He does not say that he was there because of Barack Obama. He simply says toeveryone in the room, ""I am here because of Ashley."" ""I'm here because of Ashley."" Now, by itself, that single moment of recognition between that young white girl and that oldblack man is not enough. It is not enough to give health care to the sick, or jobs to thejobless, or education to our children. But it is where we start. It is where our union growsstronger. And as so many generations have come to realize over the course of the 221 yearssince a band of patriots signed that document right here in Philadelphia, that is whereperfection begins. Thank you very much, everyone. Thank you.",obama

Thank  you  to  my  grandmother,  who  helped  raise  me,  and  is  sitting  in  Hawaii  somewhere  right   now  because  she  can't  travel,  but  who  poured  everything  she  had  into  me,  and  who  helped  to   make  me  the  man  I  am  today.  Tonight  is  for  her.   Tonight,  Minnesota,  after  54  hard  fought  contests,  our  primary  season  has  finally  come  to  an   end.  Sixteen  months  have  passed  since  we  first  stood  together  on  the  steps  of  the  Old  State   Capitol  in  Springfield,  Illinois.  Thousands  of  miles  have  been  traveled    millions  of  voices  have   been  heard.

Because  of  you,  tonight  I  can  stand  here  and  say   that  I  will  be  the  Democratic  nominee  for  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Copyright  Status:  Restricted,  seek  permission.    2010   Page  1      I  want  to  thank  all  those  in  Montana  and  South  Dakota  who  stood  up  for  change  today.  I  want   to  thank  every  American  who  stood  with  us  over  the  course  of  this  campaign,  through  the   good  days  and  the  bad,  from  the  snows  of  Cedar  Rapids  to  the  sunshine  of  Sioux  Falls.  And,   tonight,  I  also  want  to  thank  the  men  and  woman  who  took  this  journey  with  me  as  fellow   candidates  for  President.   At  this  defining  moment  for  our  nation,  we  should  be  proud  that  our  Party  put  forth  one  of  the   most  talented,  qualified  field  of  individuals  ever  to  run  for  office.  I  have  not  just  competed   with  them  as  rivals.  I   ve  learned  from  them  as  friends,  as  public  servants,  and  as  patriots  who   love  America  and  are  willing  to  work  tirelessly  to  make  this  country  better.  They  are  leaders  of   this  Party  and  leaders  that  America  will  turn  to  for  years  to  come.   And  that  is  particularly  true  for  the  candidate  who  has  traveled  further  on  this  journey  than   anyone  else:  Senator  Hillary  Clinton  has  made  history  in  this  campaign.  She  has  made  history   not  just  because  she   s  a  woman  who  has  done  what  no  woman  has  done  before,  but  because   she  is  a  leader  who  inspires  millions  of  Americans  with  her  strength,  her  courage,  and  her   commitment  to  the  causes  that  brought  us  here  tonight.  I  congratulate  her  on  her  victory  in   South  Dakota,  and  I  congratulate  her  on  the  race  that  she  has  run  throughout  this  contest.   We   ve  certainly  had  our  differences  over  the  last  16  months.  But  as  someone  who   s  shared  a   stage  with  her  many  times,  I  can  tell  you  that  what  gets  Hillary  Clinton  up  in  the  morning         even  in  the  face  of  tough  odds        is  exactly  what  sent  her  and  Bill  Clinton  to  sign  up  for  their   first  campaign  in  Texas  all  those  years  ago,  what  sent  her  to  work  at  the  Children   s  Defense   Fund  and  made  her  fight  for  health  care  as  first  lady,  what  led  her  to  the  United  States  Senate   and  fueled  her  barrier  breaking  campaign  for  the  presidency:  an  unyielding  desire  to  improve   the  lives  of  ordinary  Americans,  no  matter  how  difficult  the  fight  may  be.   And  you  can  rest  assured  that  when  we  finally  win  the  battle  for  universal  health  care  in  this   country        and  we  will  win  that  fight        she  will  be  central  to  that  victory.  When  we  transform   our  energy  policy  and  lift  our  children  out  of  poverty,  it  will  be  because  she  worked  to  help   make  it  happen.  Our  Party  and  our  country  are  better  off  because  of  her,  and  I  am  a  better   candidate  for  having  had  the  honor  to  compete  with  Hillary  Rodham  Clinton.   There  are  those  who  say  that  this  primary  has  somehow  left  us  weaker  and  more  divided.   Well,  I  say  that,  because  of  this  primary,  there  are  millions  of  Americans  who've  cast  their   ballot  for  the  very  first  time.  There  are  Independents  and  Republicans  who  understand  this   election  isn   t  just  about  a  change  of  Party  in  Washington,  but  also  about  the  need  to  change   Washington.  There  are  young  people,  and  African  Americans,  and  Hispanic  Americans,  and   women  of  all  ages  who  have  voted  in  numbers  that  have  broken  records  and  inspired  a  nation.   All  of  you  chose  to  support  a  candidate  you  believe  in  deeply.  But  at  the  end  of  the  day,  we   aren   t  the  reason  you  came  out  and  waited  in  lines  that  stretched  block  after  block  to  make   your  voice  heard.  You  didn   t  do  that  because  of  me  or  Senator  Clinton  or  anyone  else.  You  did   it  because  you  know  in  your  hearts  that  at  this  moment,  a  moment  that  will  define  a   generation,  we  cannot  afford  to  keep  doing  what  we   ve  been  doing.  We  owe  our  children  a   better  future.  We  owe  our  country  a  better  future. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Copyright  Status:  Restricted,  seek  permission.    2010   Page  2      And  for  all  those  who  dream  of  that  future  tonight,  I  say:  Let  us  begin  the  work  together.  Let   us  unite  in  common  effort  to  chart  a  new  course  for  America.   In  just  a  few  short  months,  the  Republican  Party  will  arrive  in  St.  Paul  with  a  very  different   agenda.  They  will  come  here  to  nominate  John  McCain,  a  man  who  has  served  this  country   heroically.  I  honor,  we  honor  the  service  of  John  McCain,  and  I  respect  his  many   accomplishments,  even  if  he  chooses  to  deny  mine.  My  differences  with  him  are  not  personal.   They  are  with  the  policies  he  has  proposed  in  this  campaign,  because  while  John  McCain  can   legitimately  tout  moments  of  independence  from  his  Party  in  the  past,  such  independence  has   not  been  the  hallmark  of  his  presidential  campaign.   It   s  not  change  when  John  McCain  decided  to  stand  with  George  Bush  95  percent  of  the  time,   as  he  did  in  the  Senate  last  year.   It   s  not  change  when  he  offers  four  more  years  of  Bush  economic  policies  that  have  failed  to   create  well  paying  jobs,  or  insure  our  workers,  or  help  Americans  afford  the  skyrocketing  cost   of  college,  policies  that  have  lowered  the  real  incomes  of  the  average  American  family,  and   widened  the  gap  between  Wall  Street  and  Main  Street,  and  left  our  children  with  a  mountain   of  debt.   It   s  not  change  when  he  promises  to  continue  a  policy  in  Iraq  that  asks  everything  of  our   brave  men  and  women  in  uniform  and  nothing  of  Iraqi  politicians,  a  policy  where  all  we  look   for  are  reasons  to  stay  in  Iraq,  while  we  spend  billions  of  dollars  a  month  on  a  war  that  isn   t   making  the  American  people  any  safer.  So,  I   ll  say  this:  There  are  many  words  to  describe   John  McCain   s  attempt  to  pass  off  his  embrace  of  George  Bush   s  policies  as  bipartisan  and   new,  but     change     is  not  one  of  them.     Change     is  not  one  of  them,  because  change  is  a   foreign  policy  that  doesn   t  begin  and  end  with  a  war  that  should   ve  never  been  authorized  and   never  been  waged.   I  won   t  stand  here  and  pretend  that  there  are  many  good  options  left  in  Iraq,  but  what   s  not   an  option  is  leaving  our  troops  in  that  country  for  the  next  hundred  years,  especially  at  a  time   when  our  military  is  overstretched,  our  nation  is  isolated,  and  nearly  every  other  threat  to   America  is  being  ignored.  We  must  be  as  careful  getting  out  of  Iraq  as  we  were  careless   getting  in,  but  start  leaving  we  must.  It   s  time  for  Iraqis  to  take  responsibility  for  their  future.   It   s  time  to  rebuild  our  military  and  give  our  veterans  the  care  and  the  benefits  they  deserve   when  they  come  home.   It's  time  to  refocus  our  efforts  on  Al  Qaida   s  leadership  and  Afghanistan,  and  rally  the  world   against  the  common  threats  of  the  21st  century:  terrorism  and  nuclear  weapons,  climate   change  and  poverty,  genocide  and  disease.  That   s  what  change  is.   Change,  Minnesota,  is  realizing  that  meetings  [sic]  today   s  threats  requires  not  just  our   firepower,  but  the  power  of  our  diplomacy:  tough,  direct  diplomacy,  where  the  President  of   the  United  States  isn   t  afraid  to  let  any  petty  dictator  know  where  America  stands  and  what   we  stand  for.  We  must  once  again  have  the  courage  and  the  conviction  to  lead  the  free  world. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Copyright  Status:  Restricted,  seek  permission.    2010   Page  3      That  is  the  legacy  of  Roosevelt  and  Truman  and  Kennedy.  That   s  what  the  American  people   demand.  That   s  what  change  is.   Change  is  building  an  economy  that  rewards  not  just  wealth,  but  the  work  and  the  workers   who  created  it.  It   s  understanding  that  the  struggles  facing  working  families  can   t  be  solved  by   spending  billions  of  dollars  on  more  tax  breaks  for  big  corporations  and  wealthy  CEOs,  but  by   giving  a  middle  class  tax  break  to  those  who  need  it,  and  investing  in  our  crumbling   infrastructure,  and  transforming  how  we  use  energy,  and  improving  our  schools,  and  renewing   our  commitment  to  science  and  innovation.  It   s  understanding  that  fiscal  responsibility  and   shared  prosperity  can  go  hand  in  hand,  as  they  did  when  Bill  Clinton  was  President.   John  McCain  has  spent  a  lot  of  time  talking  about  trips  to  Iraq  in  the  last  few  weeks,  but   maybe  if  he  spent  some  time  taking  trips  to  the  cities  and  towns  that  have  been  hardest  hit  by   this  economy        cities  in  Michigan,  and  Ohio,  and  right  here  in  Minnesota        he   d  understand   the  kind  of  change  that  people  are  looking  for.   Maybe  if  he  went  to  Iowa  and  met  the  student  who  works  the  night  shift  after  a  full  day  of   class  and  still  can   t  pay  the  medical  bills  for  a  sister  who   s  ill,  he   d  understand  she  can   t  afford   four  more  years  of  a  health  care  plan  that  only  takes  care  of  the  healthy  and  the  wealthy.  She   needs  us  to  pass  health  care  right  now,  a  plan  that  guarantees  insurance  to  every  American   who  wants  it  and  brings  down  premiums  for  every  family  who  needs  it.  That   s  the  change  we   need,  Minnesota.   Maybe  if  John  McCain  went  to  Pennsylvania  and  he  met  the  man  who  lost  his  job,  but  can   t   even  afford  the  gas  to  drive  around  and  look  for  a  new  one,  he   d  understand  we  can   t  afford   four  more  years  of  our  addiction  to  oil  from  dictators.  That  man  needs  us  to  pass  an  energy   policy  that  works  with  automakers  to  raise  fuel  standards,  and  makes  corporations  pay  for   their  pollution,  and  oil  companies  invest  their  record  profits  in  a  clean  energy  future,  an   energy  policy  that  will  create  millions  of  new  jobs  that  pay  well  and  can   t  be  outsourced.   That   s  the  change  we  need,  Minnesota.   And  maybe  if  John  McCain  spent  some  time  in  the  schools  of  South  Carolina  or  St.  Paul,   Minnesota,  or  where  he  spoke  tonight  in  New  Orleans,  Louisiana,  he   d  understand  that  we   can   t  afford  to  leave  the  money  behind  for  No  Child  Left  Behind    that  we  owe  it  to  our  children   to  invest  in  early  childhood  education    and  recruit  an  army  of  new  teachers  and  give  them   better  pay  and  more  support    and  finally  decide  that,  in  this  global  economy,  the  chance  to   get  a  college  education  should  not  be  a  privilege  for  the  few,  but  a  birthright  of  every   American.  That   s  the  change  we  need  in  America.  That   s  why  I   m  running  for  President  of  the   United  States.   Now,  the  other  side  will  come  here  in  September  and  offer  a  very  different  set  of  policies  and   positions,  and  that  is  a  good  thing.  That  is  a  debate  I  look  forward  to.  It  is  a  debate  that  the   American  people  deserve  on  the  issues  that  will  help  determine  the  future  of  this  country  and   the  future  for  our  children.  But  what  you  don   t  deserve  is  another  election  that   s  governed  by   fear,  and  innuendo,  and  division.  What  you  won   t  hear  from  this  campaign  or  this  Party  is  the   kind  of  politics  that  uses  religion  as  a  wedge  and  patriotism  as  a  bludgeon. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Copyright  Status:  Restricted,  seek  permission.    2010   Page  4      What  you  won   t  see  from  this  campaign  or  this  Party  is  a  politics  that  sees  our  opponents  not   as  competitors  to  challenge,  but  enemies  to  polarize,  because  we  may  call  ourselves   Democrats  and  Republicans,  but  we  are  Americans  first.  We  are  always  Americans  first.   Despite  what  the  good  senator  from  Arizona  may  have  said  tonight,  I   ve  seen  people  of   differing  views  and  opinions  find  common  cause  many  times  during  my  two  decades  in  public   life,  and  I   ve  brought  many  together  myself.  I   ve  walked  arm  in  arm  with  community  leaders   on  the  south  side  of  Chicago  and  watched  tensions  fade  as  black  and  white  and  Latino  fought   together  for  good  jobs  and  good  schools.  I   ve  sat  across  the  table  from  law  enforcement   officials  and  civil  rights  advocates  to  reform  a  criminal  justice  system  that  sent  13  innocent   people  to  death  row.  I   ve  worked  with  friends  in  the  other  Party  to  provide  more  children  with   health  insurance  and  more  working  families  with  a  tax  break,  to  curb  the  spread  of  nuclear   weapons  and  ensure  that  the  American  people  know  where  their  tax  dollars  are  being  spent,   and  to  reduce  the  influence  of  lobbyists  who  have  all  too  often  set  the  agenda  in  Washington.   In  our  country,  I  have  found  that  this  cooperation  happens  not  because  we  agree  on   everything,  but  because,  behind  all  the  false  labels  and  false  divisions  and  categories  that   define  us,  beyond  all  the  petty  bickering  and  point  scoring  in  Washington,  Americans  are  a   decent,  generous,  compassionate  people,  united  by  common  challenges  and  common  hopes.   And  every  so  often,  there  are  moments  which  call  on  that  fundamental  goodness  to  make  this   country  great  again.  So  it  was  for  that  band  of  patriots  who  declared  in  a  Philadelphia  hall  the   formation  of  a  more  perfect  union,  and  for  all  those  who  gave  on  the  fields  of  Gettysburg  and   Antietam  their  last  full  measure  of  devotion  to  save  that  same  union.  So  it  was  for  the   greatest  generation  that  conquered  fear  itself,  and  liberated  a  continent  from  tyranny,  and   made  this  country  home  to  untold  opportunity  and  prosperity.  So  it  was  for  the  workers  who   stood  out  on  the  picket  lines,  the  women  who  shattered  glass  ceilings,  the  children  who   braved  a  Selma  bridge  for  freedom   s  cause.  So  it  has  been  for  every  generation  that  faced   down  the  greatest  challenges  and  the  most  improbable  odds  to  leave  their  children  a  world   that   s  better  and  kinder  and  more  just.   And  so  it  must  be  for  us.   America,  this  is  our  moment.  This  is  our  time,  our  time  to  turn  the  page  on  the  policies  of  the   past,  our  time  to  bring  new  energy  and  new  ideas  to  the  challenges  we  face,  our  time  to  offer   a  new  direction  for  this  country  that  we  love.   The  journey  will  be  difficult.  The  road  will  be  long.  I  face  this  challenge  with  profound  humility   and  knowledge  of  my  own  limitations,  but  I  also  face  it  with  limitless  faith  in  the  capacity  of   the  American  people.   Because  if  we  are  willing  to  work  for  it,  and  fight  for  it,  and  believe  in  it,  then  I  am  absolutely   certain  that,  generations  from  now,  we  will  be  able  to  look  back  and  tell  our  children  that  this   was  the  moment  when  we  began  to  provide  care  for  the  sick  and  good  jobs  to  the  jobless.   This  was  the  moment  when  the  rise  of  the  oceans  began  to  slow  and  our  planet  began  to  heal. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.

This  was  the  moment,  this  was  the  time  when  we  came  together  to  remake  this  great  nation   so  that  it  may  always  reflect  our  very  best  selves  and  our  highest  ideals.

"Thank  you  to  the  citizens  of  Berlin  and  thank  you  to  the  people  of  Germany.  Let  me  thank   Chancellor  Merkel  and  Foreign  Minister  Steinmeier  for  welcoming  me  earlier  today.  Thank  you   Mayor  Wowereit,  the  Berlin  Senate,  the  police,  and  most  of  all  thanks  to  all  of  you  for  this   extraordinary  welcome.  Thank  you.   I  come  to  Berlin  as  so  many  of  my  countrymen  have  come  before    although  tonight,  I  speak   to  you  not  as  a  candidate  for  President,  but  as  a  citizen        a  proud  citizen  of  the  United  States,   and  a  fellow  citizen  of  the  world.   I  know  that  I  don   t  look  like  the  Americans  who   ve  previously  spoken  in  this  great  city.  The   journey  that  led  me  here  is  improbable.  My  mother  was  born  in  the  heartland  of  America,  but   my  father  grew  up  herding  goats  in  Kenya.  His  father        my  grandfather        was  a  cook,  a   domestic  servant  to  the  British.   At  the  height  of  the  Cold  War,  my  father  decided,  like  so  many  others  in  the  forgotten  corners   of  the  world,  that  his  yearning        his  dream        required  the  freedom  and  opportunity  promised   by  the  West.  And  so  he  wrote  letter  after  letter  to  universities  all  across  America  until   somebody,  somewhere  answered  his  prayer  for  a  better  life.   That  is  why  I  am  here.  And  you  are  here  because  you  too  know  that  yearning.  This  city,  of  all   cities,  knows  the  dream  of  freedom.  And  you  know  that  the  only  reason  we  stand  here  tonight   is  because  men  and  women  from  both  of  our  nations  came  together  to  work,  and  struggle,   and  sacrifice  for  that  better  life. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Property  of  .       Copyright  2008.  All  rights  reserved.   Page  1      Ours  is  a  partnership  that  truly  began  60  years  ago  this  summer,  on  the  day  when  the  first   American  plane  touched  down  at  Tempelhof.  On  that  day  much  of  this  continent  still  lay  in   ruin.  The  rubble  of  this  city  had  yet  to  be  built  into  a  wall.  The  Soviet  shadow  had  swept   across  Eastern  Europe,  while  in  the  West,  America,  Britain,  and  France  took  their  stock  of   their  losses,  and  pondered  how  the  world  might  be  remade.   This  is  where  the  two  sides  met.  And  on  the  twenty  fourth  of  June,  1948,  the  Communists   chose  to  blockade  the  western  part  of  the  city.  They  cut  off  food  and  supplies  to  more  than   two  million  Germans  in  an  effort  to  extinguish  the  last  flame  of  freedom  in  Berlin.   The  size  of  our  forces  was  no  match  for  the  larger  Soviet  Army.  And  yet  retreat  would  have   allowed  Communism  to  march  across  Europe.  Where  the  last  war  had  ended,  another  World   War  could  have  easily  begun.  And  all  that  stood  in  the  way  was  Berlin.  And  that   s  when  the   airlift  began,  when  the  largest  and  most  unlikely  rescue  in  the  history  brought  food  and  hope   to  the  people  of  this  city.   The  odds  were  stacked  against  success.  In  the  winter,  a  heavy  fog  filled  the  sky  above,  and   many  planes  were  forced  to  turn  back  without  dropping  off  the  needed  supplies.  The  streets   where  we  stand  were  filled  with  hungry  families  who  had  no  comfort  from  the  cold.   But  in  the  darkest  hours,  the  people  of  Berlin  kept  the  flame  of  hope  burning.  The  people  of   Berlin  refused  to  give  up.  And  on  one  fall  day,  hundreds  of  thousands  of  Berliners  came  here,   to  the  Tiergarten,  and  heard  the  city   s  mayor  implore  the  world  not  to  give  up  on  freedom.      There  is  only  one  possibility,     he  said.     For  us  to  stand  together  united  until  this  battle  is   won   The  people  of  Berlin  have  spoken.  We  have  done  our  duty,""  he  said,  ""and  we  will  keep   on  doing  our  duty.  People  of  the  world,  now  do  your  duty.  People  of  the  world,  look  at  Berlin.      People  of  the  world        look  at  Berlin!   Look  at  Berlin,  where  Germans  and  Americans  learned  to  work  together  and  trust  each  other   less  than  three  years  after  facing  each  other  on  the  field  of  battle.   Look  at  Berlin,  where  the  determination  of  a  people  met  the  generosity  of  the  Marshall  Plan   and  created  a  German  miracle    where  a        where  a  victory  over  tyranny  gave  rise  to  NATO,   the  greatest  alliance  ever  formed  to  defend  our  common  security.   Look  at  Berlin,  where  the  bullet  holes  in  the  buildings  and  the  somber  stones  and  pillars  near   the  Brandenburg  Gate  insist  that  we  never  forget  our  common  humanity.   People  of  the  world        look  at  Berlin,  where  a  wall  came  down,  a  continent  came  together,  and   history  proved  that  there  is  no  challenge  too  great  for  a  world  that  stands  as  one.   Sixty  years  after  the  airlift,  we  are  called  upon  again.  History  has  led  us  to  a  new  crossroad,   with  new  promise  and  new  peril. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.

Page  2      When  you,  the  German  people,  tore  down  that  wall        a  wall  that  divided  East  and  West     freedom  and  tyranny    fear  and  hope        walls  came  tumbling  down  around  the  world.  From   Kiev  to  Cape  Town,  prison  camps  were  closed,  and  the  doors  of  democracy  were  opened.   Markets  opened  too,  and  the  spread  of  information  and  technology  reduced  barriers  to   opportunity  and  prosperity.  While  the  20th  century  taught  us  that  we  share  a  common   destiny,  the  21st  century  has  revealed  a  world  more  intertwined  than  at  any  time  in  human   history.   The  fall  of  the  Berlin  Wall  brought  new  hope.  But  that  very  closeness  has  given  rise  to  new   dangers  that  cannot  be  contained  within  the  borders  of  a  country  or  by  the  distance  of  an   ocean.   Think  about  it:  The  terrorists  of  September  11th  plotted  in  Hamburg  and  trained  in  Kandahar   and  Karachi  before  killing  thousands  from  all  over  the  globe  on  American  soil.  As  we  speak,   cars  in  Boston  and  factories  in  Beijing  are  melting  the  ice  caps  in  the  Arctic,  shrinking   coastlines  in  the  Atlantic,  and  bringing  drought  to  farms  from  Kansas  to  Kenya.   Poorly  secured  nuclear  material  in  the  former  Soviet  Union,  or  secrets  from  a  scientist  in   Pakistan  could  help  build  a  bomb  that  detonates  in  Paris.  The  poppies  in  Afghanistan  come  to   Berlin  in  the  form  of  the  heroin.  The  poverty  and  violence  in  Somalia  breeds  the  terror  of   tomorrow.  The  genocide  in  Darfur  shames  the  conscience  of  us  all.   In  this  new  world,  such  dangerous  currents  have  swept  along  faster  than  our  efforts  to  contain   them.  And  that  is  why  we  cannot  afford  to  be  divided.  No  one  nation,  no  matter  how  large  or   powerful,  can  defeat  such  challenges  alone.  None  of  us  can  deny  these  threats,  or  escape   responsibility  in  meeting  them.  In  the  absence  of  Soviet  tanks  and  a  terrible  wall,  it  has   become  easy  to  forget  this  truth.  And  if  we   re  honest  with  each  other,  we  know  that   sometimes,  on  both  sides  of  the  Atlantic,  we  have  drifted  apart,  and  forgotten  our  shared   destiny.   In  Europe,  the  view  that  America  is  part  of  what  has  gone  wrong  in  our  world,  rather  than  a   force  to  help  us  make  it  right,  has  become  all  too  common.  In  America,  there  are  voices  that   deride  and  deny  the  importance  of  Europe   s  role  in  our  security  and  our  future.  Both  views   miss  the  truth:  that  Europeans  today  are  bearing  new  burdens  and  taking  more  responsibility   in  critical  parts  of  the  world    and  that  just  as  American  bases  built  in  the  last  century  still  help   to  defend  the  security  of  this  continent,  so  does  our  country  still  sacrifice  greatly  for  freedom   around  the  globe.   Yes,  there  have  been  differences  between  America  and  Europe.  No  doubt,  there  will  be   differences  in  the  future.  But  the  burdens  of  global  citizenship  continue  to  bind  us  together.  A   change  of  leadership  in  Washington  will  not  lift  this  burden.  In  this  new  century,  Americans   and  Europeans  alike  will  be  required  to  do  more        not  less.  Partnership  and  cooperation   among  nations  is  not  a  choice    it  is  the  only  way,  the  one  way,  to  protect  our  common   security  and  advance  our  common  humanity.

Page  3      That  is  why  the  greatest  danger  of  all  is  to  allow  new  walls  to  divide  us  from  one  another.  The   walls  between  old  allies  on  either  side  of  the  Atlantic  cannot  stand.  The  walls  between  the   countries  with  the  most  and  those  with  the  least  cannot  stand.  The  walls  between  races  and   tribes    natives  and  immigrants    Christians  and  Muslims  and  Jews  cannot  stand.  These  now  are   the  walls  we  must  tear  down.   We  know  that  these  walls  have  fallen  before.  After  centuries  of  strife,  the  people  of  Europe   have  formed  a  Union  of  promise  and  prosperity.  Here,  at  the  base  of  a  column  built  to  mark   victory  in  war,  we  meet  in  the  center  of  a  Europe  at  peace.  Not  only  have  walls  come  down  in   Berlin,  but  they've  come  down  in  Belfast,  where  Protestant  and  Catholic  found  a  way  to  live   together    in  the  Balkans,  where  our  Atlantic  alliance  ended  wars  and  brought  savage  war   criminals  to  justice    and  in  South  Africa,  where  the  struggle  of  a  courageous  people  defeated   apartheid.   So  history  reminds  us  that  walls  can  be  torn  down.  But  the  task  is  never  easy.  True   partnership  and  true  progress  requires  constant  work  and  sustained  sacrifice.  They  require   sharing  the  burdens  of  development  and  diplomacy    of  peace  and  progress.  They  require  allies   who  will  listen  to  each  other,  learn  from  each  other  and,  most  of  all,  trust  each  other.   That  is  why  America  cannot  turn  inward.  That  is  why  Europe  cannot  turn  inward.  America  has   no  better  partner  than  Europe.  Now  is  the  time  to  build  new  bridges  across  the  globe  as   strong  as  the  one  that  binds  us  across  the  Atlantic.  Now  is  the  time  to  join  together,  through   constant  cooperation  and  strong  institutions  and  shared  sacrifice  and  a  global  commitment  to   progress,  to  meet  the  challenges  of  the  21st  century.  It  was  this  spirit  that  led  airlift  planes  to   appear  in  the  sky  above  our  heads,  and  people  to  assemble  where  we  stand  today.  And  this  is   the  moment  when  our  nations        and  all  nations        must  summon  that  spirit  anew.   This  is  the  moment  when  we  must  defeat  terror  and  dry  up  the  well  of  extremism  that   supports  it.  This  threat  is  real  and  we  cannot  shrink  from  our  responsibility  to  combat  it.  If  we   could  create  NATO  to  face  down  the  Soviet  Union,  we  can  join  in  a  new  and  global  partnership   to  dismantle  the  networks  that  have  struck  in  Madrid  and  Amman    in  London  and  Bali    in   Washington  and  New  York.  If  we  could  win  a  battle  of  ideas  against  the  communists,  we  can   stand  with  the  vast  majority  of  Muslims  who  reject  the  extremism  that  leads  to  hate  instead  of   hope.   This  is  the  moment  when  we  must  renew  our  resolve  to  rout  the  terrorists  who  threaten  our   security  in  Afghanistan,  and  the  traffickers  who  sell  drugs  on  your  streets.  No  one  welcomes   war.  I  recognize  the  enormous  difficulties  in  Afghanistan.  But  my  country  and  yours  have  a   stake  in  seeing  that  NATO   s  first  mission  beyond  Europe   s  borders  is  a  success.  For  the  people   of  Afghanistan,  and  for  our  shared  security,  the  work  must  be  done.  America  can't  do  this   alone.   The  Afghan  people  need  our  troops  and  your  troops    our  support  and  your  support  to   defeat  the  Taliban  and  al  Qaeda,  to  develop  their  economy,  and  to  help  them  rebuild  their   nation.  We  have  too  much  at  stake  to  turn  back  now. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Property  of  .       Copyright  2008.  All  rights  reserved.   Page  4      This  is  the  moment  when  we  must  renew  the  goal  of  a  world  without  nuclear  weapons.   The   two  superpowers  that  faced  each  other  across  the  wall  of  this  city  came  too  close  too  often  to   destroying  all  we  have  built  and  all  that  we  love.  With  that  wall  gone,  we  need  not  stand  idly   by  and  watch  the  further  spread  of  the  deadly  atom.  It  is  time  to  secure  all  loose  nuclear   materials    to  stop  the  spread  of  nuclear  weapons    and  to  reduce  the  arsenals  from  another   era.  This  is  the  moment  to  begin  the  work  of  seeking  the  peace  of  a  world  without  nuclear   weapons.   This  is  the  moment  when  every  nation  in  Europe  must  have  the  chance  to  choose  its  own   tomorrow,  free  from  the  shadows  of  yesterday.  In  this  century,  we  need  a  strong  European   Union  that  deepens  the  security  and  prosperity  of  this  continent,  while  extending  a  hand   abroad.  In  this  century        in  this  city  of  all  cities        we  must  reject  the  Cold  War  mind  set  of   the  past,  and  resolve  to  work  with  Russia  when  we  can,  to  stand  up  for  our  values  when  we   must,  and  to  seek  a  partnership  that  extends  across  this  entire  continent.   This  is  the  moment  when  we  must  build  on  the  wealth  that  open  markets  have  created,  and   share  the  benefits  more  equitably.  Trade  has  been  a  cornerstone  of  our  growth  and  global   development.  But  we  will  not  be  able  to  sustain  this  growth  if  it  favors  the  few,  and  not  the   many.  Together  we  must  forge  trade  that  truly  rewards  the  work  that  creates  wealth,  with   meaningful  protections  for  our  people  and  our  planet.  This  is  the  moment  for  trade  that  is  free   and  fair  for  all.   This  is  the  moment  we  must  help  answer  the  call  for  a  new  dawn  in  the  Middle  East.  My   country  must  stand  with  yours  and  with  Europe  in  sending  a  direct  message  to  Iran  that  it   must  abandon  its  nuclear  ambitions.  We  must  support  the  Lebanese  who've  marched  and  bled   for  democracy,  and  the  Israelis  and  the  Palestinians  who  seek  a  secure  and  lasting  peace.  And   despite  past  differences,  this  is  the  moment  when  the  world  should  support  the  millions  of   Iraqis  who  seek  to  rebuild  their  lives,  even  as  we  pass  responsibility  to  the  Iraqi  government   and  finally  bring  this  war  to  a  close.   This  is  the  moment  when  we  must  come  together  to  save  this  planet.  Let  us  resolve  that  we   will  not  leave  our  children  to  a  world  where  the  oceans  rise  and  famine  spreads  and  terrible   storms  devastate  our  lands.  Let  us  resolve  that  all  nations        including  my  own        will  act  with   the  same  seriousness  of  purpose  as  has  your  nation,  and  reduce  the  carbon  we  send  into  our   atmosphere.  This  is  the  moment  to  give  our  children  back  their  future.  This  is  the  moment  to   stand  as  one.   And  this  is  the  moment  when  we  must  give  hope  to  those  left  behind  in  a  globalized  world.  We   must  remember  that  the  Cold  War  born  in  this  city  was  not  a  battle  for  land  or  treasure.  Sixty   years  ago,  the  planes  that  flew  over  Berlin  did  not  drop  bombs    instead  they  delivered  food,   and  coal,  and  candy  to  grateful  children.  And  in  that  show  of  solidarity,  those  pilots  won  more   than  a  military  victory.  They  won  hearts  and  minds    love  and  loyalty  and  trust        not  just  from   the  people  in  this  city,  but  from  all  those  who  heard  the  story  of  what  they  did  here. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Property  of  .       Copyright  2008.  All  rights  reserved.   Page  5      Now  the  world  will  watch  and  remember  what  we  do  here  with  this  moment.  Will  we  extend   our  hand  to  the  people  in  the  forgotten  corners  of  this  world  who  yearn  for  lives  marked  by   dignity  and  opportunity,  by  security  and  justice?  Will  we  lift  the  child  in  Bangladesh  from   poverty,  and  shelter  the  refugee  in  Chad,  and  banish  the  scourge  of  AIDS  in  our  time?   Will  we  stand  for  the  human  rights  of  the  dissident  in  Burma,  the  blogger  in  Iran,  or  the  voter   in  Zimbabwe?  Will  we  give  meaning  to  the  words     never  again     in  Darfur?   Will  we  acknowledge  that  there  is  no  more  powerful  example  than  the  one  each  of  our  nations   projects  to  the  world?  Will  we  reject  torture  and  stand  for  the  rule  of  law?  Will  we  welcome   immigrants  from  different  lands,  and  shun  discrimination  against  those  who  don   t  look  like  us   or  worship  like  we  do,  and  keep  the  promise  of  equality  and  opportunity  for  all  of  our  people?   People  of  Berlin        people  of  the  world        this  is  our  moment.  This  is  our  time.   I  know  my  country  has  not  perfected  itself.  At  times,  we   ve  struggled  to  keep  the  promise  of   liberty  and  equality  for  all  of  our  people.  We   ve  made  our  share  of  mistakes,  and  there  are   times  when  our  actions  around  the  world  have  not  lived  up  to  our  best  intentions.   But  I  also  know  how  much  I  love  America.  I  know  that  for  more  than  two  centuries,  we  have   strived        at  great  cost  and  great  sacrifice        to  form  a  more  perfect  union    to  seek,  with  other   nations,  a  more  hopeful  world.  Our  allegiance  has  never  been  to  any  particular  tribe  or   kingdom        indeed,  every  language  is  spoken  in  our  country    every  culture  has  left  its  imprint   on  ours    every  point  of  view  is  expressed  in  our  public  squares.  What  has  always  united  us,   what  has  always  driven  our  people,  what  drew  my  father  to  America   s  shores  is  a  set  of  ideals   that  speak  to  aspirations  shared  by  all  people:  that  we  can  live  free  from  fear  and  free  from   want    that  we  can  speak  our  minds  and  assemble  with  whomever  we  choose  and  worship  as   we  please.   These  are  the  aspirations  that  join  the  fates  of  all  nations  in  this  city.  These  aspirations  are   bigger  than  anything  that  drives  us  apart.  It  is  because  of  these  aspirations  that  the  airlift   began.  It  is  because  of  these  aspirations  that  all  free  people        everywhere        became  citizens   of  Berlin.  It  is  in  pursuit  of  these  aspirations  that  a  new  generation        our  generation        must   make  our  mark  on  the  world.   People  of  Berlin,  and  people  of  the  world,  the  scale  of  our  challenge  is  great.  The  road  ahead   will  be  long.  But  I  come  before  you  to  say  that  we  are  heirs  to  a  struggle  for  freedom.  We  are   a  people  of  improbable  hope.  With  an  eye  toward  the  future,  with  resolve  in  our  heart,  let  us   remember  this  history,  and  answer  our  destiny,  and  remake  the  world  once  again.   Thank  you,  Berlin.  God  bless  you.  Thank  you.  Thank  you. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Property  of  .       Copyright  2008.  All  rights  reserved.   Page  6  ",obama
"Thank you very much, Madam President. And thank you to the distinguished Senator fromConnecticut not only for yielding time, but also for the extraordinarily hard work that he's putin over the last several days and, in fact, over a -- a week. And I want to thank hiscounterparts on the other side, including Senator Gregg, for their hard work. Now, the fact that we're even here voting on a plan to rescue our economy from the greedand irresponsibility of Wall Street and some in Washington is an outrage. It's an outrage toevery American who works hard, pays their taxes, is doing their best every day to make abetter life for themselves and their families. And understandably, people are frustrated andthey're angry that Wall Street's mistakes have put their tax dollars at risk. And they shouldbe. I'm frustrated and angry, too. But while there's plenty of blame to go around -- and many in Washington and Wall Streetwho deserve it, all of us -- all of us have a responsibility to solve this crisis, because it affectsthe financial well-being of every single American. There will be time to punish those who setthis fire, but now is not the time to argue about how it got set, or did the neighbor sleep in hisbed, or leave the stove on. Right now we want to put out that fire; and now's the time for usto come together and do that. When the House of Representatives failed to act on Monday, we saw the single largest declinein the stock market in two decades. Over one trillion dollars of wealth was lost by the time themarkets closed. And it wasn't just the wealth of a few CEOs or Wall Street executives. The401(k)s and retirement accounts of millions became smaller. The state pension funds ofteachers and government employees lost billions upon billions of dollars. Hard-workingAmericans who invested their nest egg to watch it grow saw it diminish and in some casesdisappear. And while that decline was devastating, the consequences of the credit crisis that caused itwill be even worse if we do not act now. We're in a very dangerous situation, where financialinstitutions across this country are afraid to lend money. And if all that meant was the failureof a few banks in New York, that would be one thing. But that's not what it means. What itmeans is, if we don't act, it will be harder for Americans to get a mortgage for their home orloans they need to buy a car or send their children to college. What it means is that businesses won't be able to get the loans they need to open a newfactory or make payroll for their workers. And if they can't make payroll on Friday, thenworkers are laid off on Monday. And if workers are laid off on Monday, then they can't paytheir bills or pay back their loans to somebody else. And it will go on and on and on, ripplingthrough the entire economy. And potentially we could see thousands of businesses close,millions of jobs could be lost, and a long and painful recession could follow. In other words,this is not just a Wall Street crisis; it's an American crisis. And it's the American economy thatneeds this rescue plan. I understand completely why people would be skeptical when this President asks for a blankcheck to solve this problem. I was, too, as was Senator Dodd and a whole bunch of us here.And that's why, over a week ago, I demanded that this plan include some specific proposals toprotect taxpayers, protections that the Administration eventually agreed to, and, thanks to thehard work of Senator Dodd and Republican counterparts like Senator Gregg, we here in theSenate have agreed to, and now hopefully the House will agree to, as well. Let me just go over those principles: Number one, I said we needed an independent board to provide oversight andaccountability for how and where this money is spent at every step of the way. Number two, I said that we cannot help banks on Wall Street without helping themillions of innocent homeowners who are struggling to stay in their homes. Theydeserve a plan, too. Number three, I said that I would not allow this plan to become a welfare program forWall Street executives, whose greed and irresponsibility got us into this mess. And, finally, I said that, if American taxpayers are financing this solution, then theyhave to be treated like investors. They should get every penny of their tax dollars backonce the economy recovers. Now, this last part is important, because it's been the most misunderstood and poorlycommunicated part of this plan. This is not a plan to just hand over 700 billion dollars oftaxpayer money to a few banks. If this is managed correctly -- and that's an important ""if"" --we will hopefully get most or all of our money back and possibly even turn a profit on thegovernment's intervention, every penny of which will go directly back to the American people.And if we fall short, we will levy a fee on financial institutions so that they can repay for thelosses that they caused. Now, let me -- let's acknowledge, even with all these taxpayer protections, this plan is notperfect. Democrats and Republicans in Congress have legitimate concerns about it. Some ofmy closest colleagues, people I have the greatest respect for, still have problems with it andmay choose to vote against this bill, and I think that we can respectfully disagree. Iunderstand their frustrations. I also know that many -- many Americans share their concerns. But it's clear that, from myperspective, this is what we need to do right now to prevent the possibility of a crisis turninginto a catastrophe. It is conceivable -- it's possible that if we did nothing everything wouldturn out okay. It's -- There -- There's a possibility that that's true. And there's no doubt thatthere may be other plans out there that, had we had two or three or six months to develop,might be even more refined and might serve our purposes better. But we don't have that kind of time. And we can't afford to take a risk that the economy ofthe United States of America and, as a consequence, the worldwide economy could beplunged into a very, very deep hole. So to Democrats and Republicans who've opposed thisplan, I say: Step up to the plate. Let's do what's right for the country at this time, becausethe time to act is now. I know many Americans are wondering what happens next. And passing this bill can't be theend of our work to strengthen our economy; it must be the beginning. Because one thing I --I think all of us who may end up supporting this bill understand is that, even if we get this inplace, we could still have enormous problems and probably will have big problems in theeconomy over the next several months and potentially longer; because the fact is, is that wehave seen some mismanagement of the fundamentals of the economy for a very long time,and we are not going to dig ourselves out of that hole immediately. So this is not the end. This is the beginning. As soon as we pass this rescue plan, we need tomove aggressively with the same sense of urgency to rescue families on Main Street who arestruggling to pay their bills and keep their jobs. They've been in crisis a lot longer than WallStreet has. I've said it before and I say it again: We need to pass an economic stimulus package that willhelp ordinary Americans cope with rising food and gas prices, that can save one million jobsrebuilding our schools, and roads, and our infrastructure, and help states and cities avoidbudget cuts and tax increase[s], a -- a plan that would extend expiring unemploymentbenefits for those Americans who've lost their jobs and cannot find new ones. That's the rightthing to do at a time when consumer confidence is down and we are in great danger ofslipping into a big recession. We also must do more in this rescue package in order to help homeowners stay in theirhomes. I will continue to advocate bankruptcy reforms. I know my colleague from Illinois,Dick Durbin, has been a strong champion of this, as have many. It is the right thing to do tochange our bankruptcy laws so that people have a better chance of staying in their homes andwe're not seeing communities devastated all across the country. And we should encourageTreasury to study the option of buying individual mortgages, like we did successfully in the1930s. And finally, while we all hope that this rescue package succeeds, we should be prepared totake more vigorous actions in the months ahead to rebuild capital, if it's necessary. Now, just as families are planning for their future in tough times, Washington's going to haveto do the same. Runaway spending and record deficits are not how families run their budgets.It can't be how Washington handles people's tax dollars. So we're going to have to return tothe fiscal responsibility we had in the 1990s. And the next White House and the next Congressis going to have to work together to make sure that we go through our budget, we get rid ofprograms that don't work, that we make the ones that do work better and cost less. With lessmoney flowing into the Treasury, some useful programs or policies might need to be delayed.And some might be -- need to be stretched out over a longer period of time. But there are certain investments in our future that we cannot delay, precisely because oureconomy is in turmoil. Mr. President, I've exceeded the time a little bit. I would like unanimous consent for a couplemore minutes. [Cross talk from the Floor] Senate President: Is there objection? Seeing no objection -- Senator Obama: Thank you. There are certain investments in our future that we can't delay precisely be -- because theeconomy's in turmoil. We can't wait to help Americans keep up with rising costs and shrinkingpaychecks, and we're going to do that by making sure that we are giving our workers amiddle-class tax cut. We can't wait to relieve the burden of crushing health care costs. We can't wait to createmillions of new jobs by rebuilding our roads and our bridges, and investing in broadband linesin rural communities, and fixing our electricity grid so we can get renewable energy topopulation centers that need them. And we need to develop an energy policy that prevents usfrom sending 700 billion dollars a year to tyrants and dictators for their oil. We can't wait toeducate the next generation of Americans with the skills and knowledge they need to competewith any workers anywhere in the world. These are the priorities we cannot delay. Now, let me just close by saying this: I do not think this is going to be easy. It's not going tocome without costs. We are all going to need to sacrifice. We're all going to need to pull ourweight, because now, more than ever, we are all in this together. That's part of what thiscrisis has taught us -- that in the end of the day, there's no real separation between WallStreet and Main Street. There's only the road we're traveling on as Americans. And we willrise or fall on that journey as one nation and as one people. I know that many Americans are feeling anxiety right now about their jobs, about theirhomes, about their life savings. But I also know this, that we can steer ourselves out of thiscrisis. We are -- always have. During the great financial crisis of the last century, in his firstfireside chat, FDR told his fellow Americans that, There is an element in the re-adjustment of our financial system more important thancurrency, more important than gold, and that is the confidence of the peoplethemselves. Confidence and courage are the essentials of success in carrying out ourplan. Let us unite in banishing fear. Together we cannot fail. We cannot fail, not now, not tomorrow,not next year. This is a nation that's faced down war and depression, great challenges and great threats. Andat each and every moment, we have risen to meet up these challenges, not as Democrats, notas Republicans, but as Americans, with resolve and with confidence, with that fundamentalbelief that, here in America, our destiny is not written for us, it's written by us. And that's whowe are. And that's the country I know we can be right now. I want to thank again the extraordinary leadership of Chairman Dodd and Banking -- theBanking Committee, as well as Chairman Baucus and Majority Leader Reid. They have workedtirelessly. I want to thank the leadership in the House of Representatives. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation, understanding thatthis will not solve all our problems. It is a necessary but not sufficient step to make sure thatthis economy once again works on behalf of all Americans in their pursuit of the Americandream. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.",obama
"Hello,  Chicago.   If  there  is  anyone  out  there  who  still  doubts  that  America  is  a  place  where  all  things  are   possible    who  still  wonders  if  the  dream  of  our  founders  is  alive  in  our  time    who  still   questions  the  power  of  our  democracy,  tonight  is  your  answer.   It's  the  answer  told  by  lines  that  stretched  around  schools  and  churches  in  numbers  this   nation  has  never  seen    by  people  who  waited  three  hours  and  four  hours,  many  for  the  very   first  time  in  their  lives,  because  they  believed  that  this  time  must  be  different    that  their   voices  could  be  that  difference.   It's  the  answer  spoken  by  young  and  old,  rich  and  poor,  Democrat  and  Republican,  black,   white,  Hispanic,  Asian,  Native  American,  gay,  straight,  disabled  and  not  disabled        Americans   who  sent  a  message  to  the  world  that  we  have  never  been  just  a  collection  of  individuals  or  a   collection  of  Red  States  and  Blue  States:  we  are,  and  always  will  be,  the  United  States  of   America!   It's  the  answer  that  led  those  who  have  been  told  for  so  long  by  so  many  to  be  cynical,  and   fearful,  and  doubtful  about  what  we  can  achieve  to  put  their  hands  on  the  arc  of  history  and   bend  it  once  more  toward  the  hope  of  a  better  day.   It's  been  a  long  time  coming,  but  tonight,  because  of  what  we  did  on  this  day,  in  this  election,   at  this  defining  moment,  change  has  come  to  America.

Page  1      A  little  bit  earlier  this  evening,  I  received  an  extraordinarily  gracious  call  from  Senator  McCain.   Senator  McCain  fought  long  and  hard  in  this  campaign,  and  he's  fought  even  longer  and   harder  for  the  country  that  he  loves.  He  has  endured  sacrifices  for  America  that  most  of  us   cannot  begin  to  imagine.  We  are  better  off  for  the  service  rendered  by  this  brave  and  selfless   leader.  I  congratulate  him    I  congratulate  Governor  Palin  for  all  that  they've  achieved,  and  I   look  forward  to  working  with  them  to  renew  this  nation's  promise  in  the  months  ahead.   I  want  to  thank  my  partner  in  this  journey,  a  man  who  campaigned  from  his  heart  and  spoke   for  the  men  and  women  he  grew  up  with  on  the  streets  of  Scranton  and  rode  with  on  the  train   home  to  Delaware,  the  Vice  President  elect  of  the  United  States,  Joe  Biden.   And  I  would  not  be  standing  here  tonight  without  the  unyielding  support  of  my  best  friend  for   the  last  16  years,  the  rock  of  our  family,  the  love  of  my  life,  the  nation's  next  First  Lady:   Michelle  Obama.  Sasha  and  Malia,  I  love  you  both  more  than  you  can  imagine,  and  you  have   earned  the  new  puppy  that's  coming  with  us  to  the  White  House.  And  while  she's  no  longer   with  us,  I  know  my  grandmother's  watching,  along  with  the  family  that  made  me  who  I  am.  I   miss  them  tonight,  and  I  know  that  my  debt  to  them  is  beyond  measure.  To  my  sister  Maya,   my  sister  Alma,  all  my  other  brothers  and  sisters        thank  you  so  much  for  the  support  that   you've  given  me.  I  am  grateful  to  them.   And  to  my  campaign  manager,  David  Plouffe        the  unsung  hero  of  this  campaign,  who  built   the  best  political  campaign,  I  think,  in  the  history  of  the  United  States  of  America.  To  my  chief   strategist  David  Axelrod        who's  been  a  partner  with  me  every  step  of  the  way.  To  the  best   campaign  team  ever  assembled  in  the  history  of  politics        you  made  this  happen,  and  I  am   forever  grateful  for  what  you've  sacrificed  to  get  it  done.   But  above  all,  I  will  never  forget  who  this  victory  truly  belongs  to.  It  belongs  to  you.  It   belongs  to  you.  I  was  never  the  likeliest  candidate  for  this  office.  We  didn't  start  with  much   money  or  many  endorsements.  Our  campaign  was  not  hatched  in  the  halls  of  Washington.  It   began  in  the  backyards  of  Des  Moines  and  the  living  rooms  of  Concord  and  the  front  porches   of  Charleston.  It  was  built  by  working  men  and  women  who  dug  into  what  little  savings  they   had  to  give  5  dollars  and  10  dollars  and  20  dollars  to  the  cause.  It  grew  strength  from  the   young  people  who  rejected  the  myth  of  their  generation's  apathy,  who  left  their  homes  and   their  families  for  jobs  that  offered  little  pay  and  less  sleep.  It  drew  strength  from  the  not  so     young  people  who  braved  the  bitter  cold  and  scorching  heat  to  knock  on  doors  of  perfect   strangers,  and  from  the  millions  of  Americans  who  volunteered  and  organized  and  proved  that   more  than  two  centuries  later  a  government  of  the  people,  by  the  people,  and  for  the  people   has  not  perished  from  the  Earth.  This  is  your  victory.   And  I  know  you  didn't  do  this  just  to  win  an  election.  And  I  know  you  didn't  do  it  for  me.  You   did  it  because  you  understand  the  enormity  of  the  task  that  lies  ahead.  For  even  as  we   celebrate  tonight,  we  know  the  challenges  that  tomorrow  will  bring  are  the  greatest  of  our   lifetime:  two  wars,  a  planet  in  peril,  the  worst  financial  crisis  in  a  century.  Even  as  we  stand   here  tonight,  we  know  there  are  brave  Americans  waking  up  in  the  deserts  of  Iraq  and  the   mountains  of  Afghanistan  to  risk  their  lives  for  us.  There  are  mothers  and  fathers  who  will  lie   awake  after  the  children  fall  asleep  and  wonder  how  they'll  make  the  mortgage  or  pay  their Transcription  by  Michael  E.

There's  new  energy  to   harness,  new  jobs  to  be  created,  new  schools  to  build,  and  threats  to  meet,  alliances  to  repair.   The  road  ahead  will  be  long.  Our  climb  will  be  steep.  We  may  not  get  there  in  one  year  or   even  in  one  term.  But,  America,  I  have  never  been  more  hopeful  than  I  am  tonight  that  we   will  get  there.  I  promise  you,  we  as  a  people  will  get  there.   There  will  be  setbacks  and  false  starts.  There  are  many  who  won't  agree  with  every  decision   or  policy  I  make  as  President.  And  we  know  the  government  can't  solve  every  problem.  But  I   will  always  be  honest  with  you  about  the  challenges  we  face.  I  will  listen  to  you,  especially   when  we  disagree.  And,  above  all,  I  will  ask  you  to  join  in  the  work  of  remaking  this  nation,   the  only  way  it's  been  done  in  America  for  221  years        block  by  block,  brick  by  brick,   calloused  hand  by  calloused  hand.  What  began  21  months  ago  in  the  depths  of  winter  cannot   end  on  this  autumn  night.   This  victory  alone  is  not  the  change  we  seek.  It  is  only  the  chance  for  us  to  make  that  change.   And  that  cannot  happen  if  we  go  back  to  the  way  things  were.  It  can't  happen  without  you,   without  a  new  spirit  of  service,  a  new  spirit  of  sacrifice.  So  let  us  summon  a  new  spirit  of   patriotism,  of  responsibility,  where  each  of  us  resolves  to  pitch  in  and  work  harder  and  look   after  not  only  ourselves  but  each  other.  Let  us  remember  that,  if  this  financial  crisis  taught  us   anything,  it's  that  we  cannot  have  a  thriving  Wall  Street  while  Main  Street  suffers.  In  this   country,  we  rise  or  fall  as  one  nation,  as  one  people.  Let's  resist  the  temptation  to  fall  back  on   the  same  partisanship  and  pettiness  and  immaturity  that  has  poisoned  our  politics  for  so  long.   Let's  remember  that  it  was  a  man  from  this  state  who  first  carried  the  banner  of  the   Republican  Party  to  the  White  House,  a  Party  founded  on  the  values  of  self  reliance  and   individual  liberty  and  national  unity.  Those  are  values  that  we  all  share.  And  while  the   Democratic  Party  has  won  a  great  victory  tonight,  we  do  so  with  a  measure  of  humility  and   determination  to  heal  the  divides  that  have  held  back  our  progress.  As  Lincoln  said  to  a  nation   far  more  divided  than  ours:  ""We  are  not  enemies  but  friends....""  ""Though  passion  may  have   strained,  it  must  not  break  our  bonds  of  affection.""     And  to  those  Americans  who  whose  support  I  have  yet  to  earn,  I  may  not  have  won  your  vote   tonight,  but  I  hear  your  voices.  I  need  your  help.  And  I  will  be  your  President,  too.   And  to  all  those  watching  tonight  from  beyond  our  shores,  from  parliaments  and  palaces,  to   those  who  are  huddled  around  radios  in  the  forgotten  corners  of  the  world,  our  stories  are   singular,  but  our  destiny  is  shared,  and  a  new  dawn  of  American  leadership  is  at  hand.   To  those  who  would  tear  the  world  down:  We  will  defeat  you.  To  those  who  seek  peace  and   security:  We  support  you.  And  to  all  those  who  have  wondered  if  America's  beacon  still  burns   as  bright:  Tonight  we've  proved  once  more  that  the  true  strength  of  our  nation  comes  not   from  the  might  of  our  arms  or  the  scale  of  our  wealth,  but  from  the  enduring  power  of  our   ideals:  democracy,  liberty,  opportunity,  and  unyielding  hope.

Our  union  can  be  perfected.  What   we've  already  achieved  gives  us  hope  for  what  we  can  and  must  achieve  tomorrow.   This  election  had  many  firsts  and  many  stories  that  will  be  told  for  generations.  But  one  that's   on  my  mind  tonight's  about  a  woman  who  cast  her  ballot  in  Atlanta.  She's  a  lot  like  the   millions  of  others  who  stood  in  line  to  make  their  voice  heard  in  this  election  except  for  one   thing:  Ann  Nixon  Cooper  is  106  years  old.   cars  on  the  road  or  planes  in  the  sky    when  someone  like  her  couldn't  vote  for  two  reasons:   because  she  was  a  woman  and  because  of  the  color  of  her  skin.   She  was  born  just  a  generation  past  slavery    a  time  when  there  were  no   And  tonight,  I  think  about  all  that  she's  seen  throughout  her  century  in  America        the   heartache  and  the  hope    the  struggle  and  the  progress    the  times  we  were  told  that  we  can't,   and  the  people  who  pressed  on  with  that  American  creed:  Yes  we  can.   At  a  time  when  women's  voices  were  silenced  and  their  hopes  dismissed,  she  lived  to  see   them  stand  up  and  speak  out  and  reach  for  the  ballot:  Yes  we  can.   When  there  was  despair  in  the  dust  bowl  and  depression  across  the  land,  she  saw  a  nation   conquer  fear  itself  with  a  New  Deal,  new  jobs,  a  new  sense  of  common  purpose:  Yes  we  can.   When  the  bombs  fell  on  our  harbor  and  tyranny  threatened  the  world,  she  was  there  to   witness  a  generation  rise  to  greatness  and  a  democracy  was  saved:  Yes  we  can.   She  was  there  for  the  buses  in  Montgomery,  the  hoses  in  Birmingham,  a  bridge  in  Selma,  and   a  preacher  from  Atlanta  who  told  a  people  that  ""we  shall  overcome"":  Yes  we  can.   A  man  touched  down  on  the  moon,  a  wall  came  down  in  Berlin,  a  world  was  connected  by  our   own  science  and  imagination.   And  this  year,  in  this  election,  she  touched  her  finger  to  a  screen,  and  cast  her  vote,  because   after  106  years  in  America,  through  the  best  of  times  and  the  darkest  of  hours,  she  knows   how  America  can  change:  Yes  we  can.   America,  we  have  come  so  far.  We  have  seen  so  much.  But  there  is  so  much  more  to  do.  So   tonight,  let  us  ask  ourselves        if  our  children  should  live  to  see  the  next  century    if  my   daughters  should  be  so  lucky  to  live  as  long  as  Ann  Nixon  Cooper,  what  change  will  they  see?   What  progress  will  we  have  made? Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Property  of  .       Copyright  2008.  All  rights  reserved.   Page  4      This  is  our  chance  to  answer  that  call.  This  is  our  moment.  This  is  our  time,  to  put  our  people   back  to  work  and  open  doors  of  opportunity  for  our  kids    to  restore  prosperity  and  promote   the  cause  of  peace    to  reclaim  the  American  dream  and  reaffirm  that  fundamental  truth,  that,   out  of  many,  we  are  one      that  while  we  breathe,  we  hope.  And  where  we  are  met  with   cynicism  and  doubt  and  those  who  tell  us  that  we  can't,  we  will  respond  with  that  timeless   creed  that  sums  up  the  spirit  of  a  people:  Yes,  we  can.   Thank  you.   God  bless  you.   And  may  God  bless  the  United  States  of  America.     Abraham  Lincoln,  Second  Inaugural  Address     E  pluribus  unum Transcription  by  Michael  E.

"This  morning  we  woke  up  to  more  sobering  news  about  the  state  of  our  economy.  The   240,000  jobs  lost  in  October  marks  the  10th  consecutive  month  that  our  economy  has  shed   jobs.  In  total,  we've  lost  nearly  1.2  million  jobs  this  year,  and  more  than  10  million  Americans   are  now  unemployed.  Tens  of  millions  of  families  are  struggling  to  figure  out  how  to  pay  the   bills  and  stay  in  their  homes.  Their  stories  are  an  urgent  reminder  that  we  are  facing  the   greatest  economic  challenge  of  our  lifetime,  and  we're  going  to  have  to  act  swiftly  to  resolve   it. Now,  the  United  States  has  only  one  government  and  one  President  at  a  time,  and  until   January  20th  of  next  year,  that  government  is  the  current  Administration.  I've  spoken  to   President  Bush.  I  appreciate  his  commitment  to  ensuring  that  his  economic  policy  team  keeps   us  fully  informed  as  developments  unfold.  And  I'm  also  thankful  for  his  invitation  to  the  White   House.   Immediately  after  I  become  President,  I'm  going  to  confront  this  economic  crisis  head  on  by   taking  all  necessary  steps  to  ease  the  credit  crisis,  help  hardworking  families,  and  restore   growth  and  prosperity.  This  morning  I  met  with  members  of  my  Transition  Economic  Advisory   Board,  who  are  standing  behind  me,  alongside  my  Vice  President  elect,  Joe  Biden.  They  will   help  to  guide  the  work  of  my  transition  team,  working  with  Rahm  Emanuel,  my  Chief  of  Staff,   in  developing  a  strong  set  of  policies  to  respond  to  this  crisis.   We  discussed  in  the  earlier  meeting  several  of  the  most  immediate  challenges  facing  our   economy  and  key  priorities  on  which  to  focus  on  in  the  days  and  weeks  ahead. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Property  of  .       Copyright  2008.  All  rights  reserved.   Page  1      First  of  all,  we  need  a  rescue  plan  for  the  middle  class  that  invests  in  immediate  efforts  to   create  jobs  and  provide  relief  to  families  that  are  watching  their  paychecks  shrink  and  their   life  savings  disappear.  A  particularly  urgent  priority  is  a  further  extension  of        of   unemployment  insurance  benefits  for  workers  who  cannot  find  work  in  the  increasingly  weak   economy.  A  fiscal  stimulus  plan  that  will  jump  start  economic  growth  is  long  overdue.  I've   talked  about  it  throughout  this        the  last  few  months  of  the  campaign.  We  should  get  it  done.   Second,  we  have  to  address  the  spreading  impact  of  the  financial  crisis  on  the  other  sectors  of   our  economy        small  businesses  that  are  struggling  to  meet  their  payrolls  and  finance  their   holiday  inventories,  and  state  and  municipal  governments  facing  devastating  budget  cuts  and   tax  increases.  We  must  also  remember  that  the  financial  crisis  is  increasingly  global  and   requires  a  global  response.   The  news  coming  out  of  the  auto  industry  this  week  reminds  us  of  the  hardship  it  faces         hardship  that  goes  far  beyond  individual  auto  companies  to  the  countless  suppliers,  small   businesses,  and  communities  throughout  our  nation  who  depend  on  a  vibrant  American  auto   industry.  The  auto  industry  is  the  backbone  of  American  manufacturing  and  a  critical  part  of   our  attempt  to  reduce  our  dependence  on  foreign  oil.   I  would  like  to  see  the  Administration  do  everything  it  can  to  accelerate  the  retooling   assistance  that  Congress  has  already  enacted.  In  addition,  I  have  made  it  a  high  priority  for   my  transition  team  to  work  on  additional  policy  options  to  help  the  auto  industry  adjust,   weather  the  financial  crisis,  and  succeed  in  producing  fuel  efficient  cars  here  in  the  United   States  of  America.  And  I  was  glad  to  be  joined  today  by  Governor  Jennifer  Granholm,  who   obviously  has  great  knowledge  and  great  interest  on  this  issue.  I've  asked  my  team  to  explore   what  we  can  do  under  current  law  and  whether  additional  legislation  will  be  needed  for  this   purpose.   Third,  we  will  review  the  implementation  of  this  Administration's  financial  program  to  ensure   that  the  government's  efforts  are  achieving  their  central  goal  of  stabilizing  financial  markets   while  protecting  taxpayers,  helping  homeowners,  and  not  unduly  rewarding  the  management   of  financial  firms  that  are  receiving  government  assistance.  It  is  absolutely  critical  that  the   Treasury  work  closely  with  the  FDIC,  HUD,  and  other  government  agencies  to  use  the   substantial  authority  that  they  already  have  to  help  families  avoid  foreclosure  and  stay  in  their   homes.   Finally,  as  we  monitor  and  address  these  immediate  economic  challenges,  we  will  be  moving   forward  in  laying  out  a  set  of  policies  that  will  grow  our  middle  class  and  strengthen  our   economy  in  the  long  term.  We  cannot  afford  to  wait  on  moving  forward  on  the  key  priorities   that  I  identified  during  the  campaign,  including  clean  energy,  health  care,  education,  and  tax   relief  for  middle  class  families.  My  transition  team  will  be  working  on  each  of  these  priorities  in   the  weeks  ahead,  and  I  intend  to  reconvene  this  advisory  board  to  discuss  the  best  ideas  for   responding  to  these  immediate  problems. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Property  of  .       Copyright  2008.  All  rights  reserved.   Page  2      Let  me  close  by  saying  this:  I  do  not  underestimate  the  enormity  of  the  task  that  lies  ahead.   We  have  taken  some  major  action  to  date,  and  we  will  need  further  action  during  this   transition  and  subsequent  months.  Some  of  the  choices  that  we  make  are  going  to  be  difficult.   And  I  have  said  before  and  I  will  repeat  again:  It  is  not  going  to  be  quick  and  it  is  not  going  to   be  easy  for  us  to  dig  ourselves  out  of  the  hole  that  we  are  in,  but  America  is  a  strong  and   resilient  country.  And  I  know  we  will  succeed  if  we  put  aside  partisanship  and  politics  and   work  together  as  one  nation.  That's  what  I  intend  to  do. Transcription  by  Michael  E.

"Senator  Obama:  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  President    Ladies  and  Gentlemen  of  the  Senate:   I  have  to  say  that  I  didn't  anticipate  speaking  today,  but  the  importance,  I  think,  of  this  issue   is  one  in  which  I  feel  it's  important  for  me  to  address  this  body.   You  know,  during  the  election  I  had  the  occasion  of  meeting  a  woman  who  had  supported  me   in  my  campaign.  And  she  decided  to  come  to  shake  my  hand  and  take  a  photograph.  A   wonderful  woman,  she  wasn't  asking  for  anything,  and  I  was  very  grateful  that  she  took  time   to  come  by.  It  was  a[n]  unexceptional  moment  except  for  the  fact  that  she  was  born  in  1894.   And  her  name  was  Marguerite  Lewis,  an  African  American  woman  who  had  been  born  in   Louisiana,  born  in  the  shadow  of  slavery,  born  at  a  time  when  lynchings  were  commonplace,   born  at  a  time  when  African  Americans  and  women  could  not  vote.   And  yet,  over  the  course  of  decades  she  had  participated  in  broadening  our  democracy  and   ensuring  that,  in  fact,  at  some  point,  if  not  herself,  then  her  children  and  her  grandchildren   and  her  great  grandchildren  would  be  in  a  position  in  which  they  could,  too,  call  themselves   citizens  of  the  United  States  and  make  certain  that  this  Government  works  not  just  on  behalf   of  the  mighty  and  the  powerful  but  also  on  behalf  of  people  like  her. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.  Property  of     Copyright    2010.  All  rights  reserved.   Page  1      And  so  the  fact  that  she  voted  and  that  her  vote  was  counted  in  this  election  was  of  supreme   importance  to  her  and  it  is  the  memory  of  talking  to  her  and  shaking  her  hand  that  causes  me   to  rise  on  this  occasion.   I  am  absolutely  convinced  that  the  President  of  the  United  States,  George  Bush,  won  this   election.  I  also  believe  that  he  got  more  votes  in  Ohio.  I  think,  as  has  already  been  said  by   some  of  the  speakers  in  this  body,  this  is  not  an  issue  in  which  we  are  challenging  the   outcome  of  the  election.  And  I  think  it's  important  for  us  to  separate  out  the  issue  of  the   election  outcome  with  the  election  process.   I  was  not  in  this  body  four  years  ago,  but  what  I  observed  as  a  voter,  as  a  citizen  of  Illinois   four  years  ago,  were  troubling  evidence  of  the  fact  that  not  every  vote  was  being  counted.   And  I  think  that  it  is  unfortunate  four  years  later  that  we  continue  to  see  circumstances  in   which  people  who  believe  that  they  have  the  right  to  vote        who  show  up  at  the  polls        still   continue  to  confront  the  sort  of  problems  that  have  been  documented  as  taking  place,  not  just   in  Ohio,  but  [in]  places  all  across  the  country.   I  would  strongly  urge  that  this  Chamber,  as  well  as  the  House  of  Representatives,  take  it  upon   itself  once  and  for  all  to  reform  this  system.  There  is  no  reason,  at  a  time  when  we  have   enormous  battles  taking  place  ideologically  all  across  the  globe,  at  a  time  when  we're  try  to   make  certain  that  we  encourage  democracy  in  Iraq  and  Afghanistan  and  other  places   throughout  the  world,  that  we  have  the  legitimacy  of  our  elections  challenged,  rightly  or   wrongly,  by  people  who  are  not  certain  as  to  whether  our  processes  are  fair  and  just.  This  is   something  that  we  can  fix.  We  have  experts  on  both  sides  of  the  aisle  who  know  how  to  fix  it.   What  we've  lacked  is  the  political  will.   I  would  strongly  urge  that,  in  a  circumstance  in  which  too  many  voters  have  stood  in  long   lines  for  hours,  in  which  too  many  voters  have  cast  votes  on  machines  that  jam  or  malfunction   or  suck  the  votes  without  a  trace,  in  which  too  many  voters  try  to  register  to  vote  only  to   discover  that  their  names  don't  appear  on  the  roles,  or  that  partisan  political  interests  and   those  that  serve  them  have  worked  hard  to  throw  up  every  barrier  to  recognize  them  as   lawful,  in  which  too  many  voters  will  know  that  there  are  different  elections  for  different  parts   of  the  country  and  that  these  differences  turn  shamefully  on  differences  of  wealth  or  of  race,   in  which  too  many  voters  have  to  contend  with  state  officials,  servants  of  the  public,  who  put   partisan  or  personal  political  interests  ahead  of  the  public  in  administering  our  elections        in   such  circumstances,  we  have  an  obligation  to  fix  the  problem.   And  I  have  to  add  that  this  is  not  a  problem  unique  to  this  election,  and  it  is  not  a  partisan   problem.  Keep  in  mind,  I  come  from  Cook  County,  from  Chicago,  in  which  there  is  a  long   record  of  these  kinds  of  problems  taking  place  and  disadvantaging  Republicans  as  well  as   Democrats.  So  I  would  ask  that  all  of  us  rise  up  and  use  this  occasion  to  amend  this  problem.   Thank  you. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.  Property  of     Copyright    2010.

"Let  me  begin  by  thanking  the  bipartisan  group  of  U.S.  Governors  who  convened  this  meeting.   Few  challenges  facing  America        and  the  world        are  more  urgent  than  combating  climate   change.  The  science  is  beyond  dispute  and  the  facts  are  clear.  Sea  levels  are  rising.  Coastlines   are  shrinking.  We   ve  seen  record  drought,  spreading  famine,  and  storms  that  are  growing   stronger  with  each  passing  hurricane  season.   Climate  change  and  our  dependence  on  foreign  oil,  if  left  unaddressed,  will  continue  to   weaken  our  economy  and  threaten  our  national  security.   I  know  many  of  you  are  working  to  confront  this  challenge.  In  particular,  I  want  to  commend   Governor  Sebelius,  Governor  Doyle,  Governor  Crist,  Governor  Blagojevich  and  your  host,   Governor  Schwarzenegger.  All  of  you  have  shown  true  leadership  in  the  fight  to  combat  global   warming.  And  we   ve  also  seen  a  number  of  businesses  doing  their  part  by  investing  in  clean   energy  technologies.   But  too  often,  Washington  has  failed  to  show  the  same  kind  of  leadership.  That  will  change   when  I  take  office.  My  presidency  will  mark  a  new  chapter  in  America   s  leadership  on  climate   change  that  will  strengthen  our  security  and  create  millions  of  new  jobs  in  the  process.  That   will  start  with  a  federal  cap  and  trade  system. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.  Property  of     Copyright    2010.  All  rights  reserved.   Page  1      We'll  establish  strong  annual  targets  that  set  us  on  a  course  to  reduce  emissions  to  their  1990   levels  by  2020  and  reduce  them  an  additional  80%  by  2050.  Further,  we'll  invest  15  billion   dollars  each  year  to  catalyze  private  sector  efforts  to  build  a  clean  energy  future.  We'll  invest   in  solar  power,  wind  power,  and  next  generation  biofuels.  We'll  tap  nuclear  power,  while   making  sure  it   s  safe    and  we'll  develop  clean  coal  technologies.   This  investment  will  not  only  help  us  reduce  our  dependence  on  foreign  oil,  making  the  United   States  more  secure    and  it  will  not  only  help  us  bring  about  a  clean  energy  future,  saving  the   planet.  It  will  also  help  us  transform  our  industries  and  steer  our  country  out  of  this  economic   crisis  by  generating  five  million  new  green  jobs  that  pay  well  and  can   t  be  outsourced.   The  truth  is,  the  United  States  can't  meet  this  challenge  alone.  Solving  this  problem  will   require  all  of  us  working  together.  I  understand  that  your  meeting  is  being  attended  by   government  officials  from  over  a  dozen  countries,  including  the  UK,  Canada,  Mexico,  Brazil   and  Chile,  Poland  and  Australia,  India  and  Indonesia.  And  I  look  forward  to  working  with  all   nations  to  meet  this  challenge  in  the  coming  years.   Let  me  also  say  a  special  word  to  the  delegates  from  around  the  world  who  will  gather  at   Poland  next  month.  Your  work  is  vital  to  the  planet.  While  I  won   t  be  President  at  the  time  of   your  meeting  and  while  the  United  States  has  only  one  President  at  a  time,  I   ve  asked   Members  of  Congress  who  are  attending  the  conference  as  observers  to  report  back  to  me  on   what  they  learn  there.  And  once  I  take  office,  you  can  be  sure  that  the  United  States  will  once   again  engage  vigorously  in  these  negotiations,  and  help  lead  the  world  toward  a  new  era  of   global  cooperation  on  climate  change.   Now  is  the  time  to  confront  this  challenge  once  and  for  all.  Delay  is  no  longer  an  option.   Denial  is  no  longer  an  acceptable  response.  The  stakes  are  too  high    the  consequences  too   serious.  Stopping  climate  change  won   t  be  easy  and  it  won   t  happen  overnight.  But  I  promise   you  this:  When  I  am  President,  any  governor  who   s  willing  to  promote  clean  energy  will  have   a  partner  in  the  White  House.  Any  company  that   s  willing  to  invest  in  clean  energy  will  have   an  ally  in  Washington.  And  any  nation  that   s  willing  to  join  the  cause  of  combating  climate   change  will  have  an  ally  in  the  United  States  of  America.   Thank  you. Transcription  by  Michael  E.

"The  news  this  past  week,  including  this  morning   s  news  about  Citigroup,  has  made  it  even   more  clear  that  we  are  facing  an  economic  crisis  of  historic  proportions.  Our  financial  markets   are  under  stress.  New  home  purchases  in  October  were  the  lowest  in  half  a  century.  Recently,   more  than  half  a  million  jobless  claims  were  filed,  the  highest  in  18  years.  And  if  we  do  not   act  swiftly  and  boldly,  most  experts  now  believe  that  we  could  lose  millions  of  jobs  next  year.   While  we  can   t  underestimate  the  challenges  that  we  face,  we  also  can   t  underestimate  our   capacity  to  overcome  them,  to  summon  that  spirit  of  determination  and  optimism  that  has   always  defined  us,  and  to  move  forward  in  a  new  direction  to  create  new  jobs,  reform  our   financial  system,  and  fuel  long  term  economic  growth.   We  know  this  won   t  be  easy,  and  it  won   t  happen  overnight.  We   ll  need  to  bring  together  the   best  minds  in  America  to  guide  us,  and  that  is  what  I   ve  sought  to  do  in  assembling  my   economic  team.  I   ve  sought  leaders  who  could  offer  both  sound  judgment  and  fresh  thinking,   both  a  depth  of  experience  and  a  wealth  of  bold,  new  ideas,  and  most  of  all  who  share  my   fundamental  belief  that  we  cannot  have  a  thriving  Wall  Street  without  a  thriving  Main  Street,   that  in  this  country  we  rise  or  fall  as  one  nation,  as  one  people.   Today,  Vice  President  elect  Biden  and  I  are  pleased  to  announce  the  nomination  of  four   individuals  who  meet  these  criteria  to  lead  our  economic  team:  Timothy  Geithner,  as  secretary   of  treasury    Lawrence  Summers,  as  the  director  of  our  National  Economic  Council    Christina   Romer,  as  chair  of  the  Council  of  Economic  Advisers    and  Melody  Barnes,  as  director  of  the   Domestic  Policy  Council. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Property  of  .       Copyright  2008.  All  rights  reserved.   Page  1      Having  served  in  senior  roles  at  Treasury,  the  IMF,  and  the  New  York  Fed,  Tim  Geithner  offers   not  just  extensive  experience  shaping  economic  policy  and  managing  financial  markets,  he   also  has  an  unparalleled  understanding  of  our  current  economic  crisis  in  all  of  its  depth,   complexity,  and  urgency.  Tim  will  waste  no  time  getting  up  to  speed.  He  will  start  his  first  day   on  the  job  with  a  unique  insight  into  the  failures  of  today   s  markets  and  a  clear  vision  of  the   steps  we  must  take  to  revive  them.  The  reality  is  that  the  economic  crisis  we  face  is  no  longer   just  an  American  crisis    it   s  a  global  crisis.  And  we  will  need  to  reach  out  to  countries  around   the  world  to  craft  a  global  response.  Tim   s  extensive  international  experience  makes  him   uniquely  suited  to  do  that  work.   Growing  up  partly  in  Africa  and  having  lived  and  worked  throughout  Asia,  having  served  as   undersecretary  of  the  treasury  for  international  affairs,  one  of  the  many  roles  in  the   international  arena,  and  having  studied  both  Chinese  and  Japanese,  Tim  understands  the   language  of  today   s  international  markets  in  more  ways  than  one.  Tim  served  with  distinction   under  both  Democrats  and  Republicans  and  has  a  long  history  of  working  comfortably  and  as   an  honest  broker  on  both  sides  of  the  aisle.  With  stellar  performances  and  outstanding  results   at  every  stage  of  his  career,  Tim  has  earned  the  confidence  and  respect  of  business,  financial,   and  community  leaders,  members  of  Congress,  and  political  leaders  around  the  world.  And  I   know  he  will  do  so  once  again  as  America   s  next  treasury  secretary,  the  chief  economic   spokesman  for  my  Administration.   Now,  like  Tim,  Larry  Summers  also  brings  a  singular  combination  of  skill,  intellect,  and   experience  to  the  role  he  will  play  in  our  Administration.  As  undersecretary,  deputy  secretary,   and  then  secretary  of  the  treasury,  Larry  helped  guide  us  through  several  major  international   financial  crises  and  was  a  central  architect  of  the  policies  that  led  to  the  longest  economic   expansion  in  American  history,  with  record  surpluses,  rising  family  incomes,  and  more  than  20   million  new  jobs.  He  also  championed  a  range  of  measures,  from  tax  credits  to  enhanced   lending  programs  to  consumer  financial  protections,  that  greatly  benefited  middle  income   families.   As  a  thought  leader,  Larry  has  urged  us  to  confront  the  problems  of  income  inequality  and  the   middle  class  squeeze,  consistently  arguing  that  the  key  to  a  strong  economy  is  a  strong,   vibrant,  growing  middle  class.  This  idea  is  at  the  core  of  my  own  economic  philosophy  and  will   be  the  foundation  of  all  of  my  economic  policies.   And  as  one  of  the  great  economic  minds  of  our  time,  Larry  has  earned  a  global  reputation  for   being  able  to  cut  to  the  heart  of  the  most  complex  and  novel  policy  challenges.  With  respect   to  both  our  current  financial  crisis  and  other  pressing  economic  issues  of  our  time,  his   thinking,  writing,  and  speaking  have  set  the  terms  of  the  debate.  I   m  glad  he  will  be  by  my   side,  playing  the  critical  role  of  coordinating  my  Administration   s  economic  policy  in  the  White   House,  and  I  will  rely  heavily  on  his  advice  as  we  navigate  the  uncharted  waters  of  this   economic  crisis. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Property  of  .       Copyright  2008.  All  rights  reserved.   Page  2      As  one  of  the  most  expert  people  in  America  on  economic  crises  and  how  to  solve  them,  my   next  nominee,  Christina  Romer,  will  bring  a  critically  needed  perspective  to  her  work  as  chair   of  my  Council  of  Economic  Advisors.  Christina  is  both  a  leading  macroeconomist  and  a  leading   economic  historian,  perhaps  best  known  for  her  work  on  America   s  recovery  from  the  Great   Depression  and  the  robust  economic  expansion  that  followed.   Since  2003,  she   s  been  co  director  of  the  National  Bureau  of  Economic  Research  Monetary   Economics  program.  She   s  also  a  member  of  the  bureau   s  Business  Cycle  Dating  Committee,   the  body  charged  with  officially  determining  whether  a  recession  has  started  and  ended,   experience  which  will  serve  her  well  as  she  advises  me  on  our  current  economic  challenges.   Christina  has  done  groundbreaking  research  on  many  of  the  topics  our  Administration  will   confront,  from  tax  policy  to  fighting  recessions.  And  her  clear  eyed,  independent  analyses   have  received  praise  from  both  conservative  and  liberal  thinkers  alike.  I  look  forward  to  her   wise  counsel  in  the  White  House.   Finally,  we  know  that  rebuilding  our  economy  will  require  action  on  a  great  variety  of  fronts:   from  education  and  health  care  to  energy  and  Social  Security.  Without  sound  policies  in  these   areas,  we  can  neither  enjoy  sustained  economic  growth  nor  realize  our  full  potential  as  a   people.  So  I  am  extraordinarily  pleased  that  Melody  Barnes,  one  of  the  most  respected  policy   experts  in  America,  will  serve  as  my  director  of  the  Domestic  Policy  Council,  and  that  she  will   be  working  hand  in  hand  with  my  economic  policy  team  to  chart  a  course  to  economic   recovery.  An  integral  part  of  that  course  will  be  health  care  reform,  and  she  will  work  closely   with  my  secretary  of  health  and  human  services  on  that  issue.   As  executive  vice  president  for  policy  at  the  Center  for  American  Progress,  Melody  directed  a   network  of  policy  experts  dedicated  to  finding  solutions  for  struggling  middle  class  families.   She  also  served  as  chief  counsel  to  the  great  Senator  Ted  Kennedy  on  the  Senate  Judiciary   Committee,  working  on  issues  ranging  from  crime  to  immigration  to  bankruptcy,  and  fighting   tirelessly  to  protect  civil  rights,  women   s  rights,  and  religious  freedom.  Melody   s  brilliant  legal   mind  and  her  long  experience  working  to  secure  the  liberties  on  which  this  nation  was   founded,  as  well  as  to  secure  the  opportunities  for  those  who   ve  been  left  behind,  make  her  a   perfect  fit  for  DPC  director.   I'm  grateful  that  Tim,  Larry,  Christina,  and  Melody  have  accepted  my  nomination,  and  I  am   looking  forward  to  working  closely  with  them  in  the  months  ahead.  That  work  starts  today,   because  the  truth  is,  we  do  not  have  a  minute  to  waste.  Right  now,  our  economy  is  trapped  in   a  vicious  cycle:  The  turmoil  on  Wall  Street  means  a  new  round  of  belt  tightening  for  families   and  businesses  on  Main  Street,  and  as  folks  produce  less  and  consume  less,  that  just  deepens   the  problems  in  our  financial  markets.  These  extraordinary  stresses  on  our  financial  system   require  extraordinary  policy  responses.  And  my  Administration  will  honor  the  public   commitments  made  by  the  current  Administration  to  address  this  crisis.   Further,  beyond  any  immediate  actions  we  may  take,  we  need  a  recovery  plan  for  both  Wall   Street  and  Main  Street,  a  plan  that  stabilizes  our  financial  system  and  gets  credit  flowing Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Property  of  .       Copyright  2008.  All  rights  reserved.   Page  3      again,  while  at  the  same  time  addressing  our  growing  foreclosure  crisis,  helping  our  struggling   auto  industry,  and  creating  and  saving  2.5  million  jobs,  jobs  rebuilding  our  infrastructure,  our   roads,  our  bridges,  modernizing  our  schools,  and  creating  the  clean  energy  infrastructure  of   the  21st  century.  Because  at  this  moment,  we  need  to  restore  both  confidence  in  the  markets   and  restore  confidence  of  middle  class  families,  who  find  themselves  working  harder,  earning   less,  and  falling  further  and  further  behind.   I   ve  asked  my  economic  team  to  develop  recommendations  for  this  plan  and  to  consult  with   Congress,  the  current  Administration,  and  the  Federal  Reserve  on  immediate  economic   developments  over  the  next  two  months.  I   ve  requested  that  they  brief  me  on  these  matters   on  a  daily  basis.  And  in  the  coming  weeks,  I  will  provide  the  American  people  and  the   incoming  Congress  with  an  overview  of  their  initial  recommendations.  It  is  my  hope  that  the   new  Congress  will  begin  work  on  an  aggressive  economic  recovery  plan  when  they  convene  in   early  January  so  that  our  Administration  can  hit  the  ground  running.   With  our  economy  in  distress,  we  cannot  hesitate  and  we  cannot  delay.  Our  families  can   t   afford  to  keep  on  waiting  and  hoping  for  a  solution.  They  can   t  afford  to  watch  another  month   of  unpaid  bills  pile  up,  another  semester  of  tuition  slip  out  of  reach,  another  month  where,   instead  of  saving  for  retirement,  they   re  dipping  into  their  savings  just  to  get  by.  And  I  want   to  repeat:  This  will  not  be  easy.  There  are  no  shortcuts  or  quick  fixes  to  this  crisis,  which  has   been  many  years  in  the  making,  and  the  economy  is  likely  to  get  worse  before  it  gets  better.   Full  recovery  will  not  happen  immediately.  And  to  make  the  investments  we  need,  we   ll  have   to  scour  our  federal  budget,  line  by  line,  and  make  meaningful  cuts  and  sacrifices,  as  well,   something  I   ll  be  discussing  further  tomorrow.   Despite  all  of  this,  I  am  hopeful  about  the  future.  I  have  full  confidence  in  the  wisdom  and   ingenuity  of  my  economic  team  and  in  the  hard  work,  courage,  and  sacrifice  of  the  American   people.  And  most  of  all,  I  believe  deeply  in  the  resilience  and  the  spirit  of  this  nation.  I  know   we  can  work  our  way  out  of  this  crisis  because  we   ve  done  it  before.  And  I  know  we  will   succeed  once  again  if  we  put  aside  partisanship  and  politics  and  work  together.   That   s  exactly  what  I  intend  to  do  as  President  of  the  United  States. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Property  of  .       Copyright  2008.  All  rights  reserved.

"Good morning, everybody. I hope you all had a wonderful Thanksgiving. Last week, we announced our economic team, which is working as we speak to craft anEconomic Recovery Program to create jobs and grow our struggling economy. Today, VicePresident-elect Biden and I are pleased to announce our national security team. The national security challenges we face are just as grave -- and just as urgent -- as oureconomic crisis. We are fighting two wars. Our old conflicts remain unresolved, and newlyassertive powers have put strains on the international system. The spread of nuclear weaponsraises the peril that the world   s deadliest technologies could fall into dangerous hands. Ourdependence on foreign oil empowers authoritarian governments and endangers our planet. America must also be strong at home to be strong abroad. We need to provide education andopportunity to all our citizens, so every American can compete with anyone, anywhere. Andour economic power must sustain our military strength, our diplomatic leverage, and ourglobal leadership. The common thread linking these challenges is the fundamental reality that in the 21stcentury, our destiny is shared with the world's. From our markets to our security, from ourpublic health to our climate, we must act with the understanding that, now more than ever,we have a stake in what happens across the globe. And as we learned so painfully on 9/11,terror cannot be contained by borders, nor safety provided by oceans alone. Last week, we were reminded of this threat once again when terrorists took the lives of sixAmerican among nearly 200 victims in Mumbai. In the world we seek, there is no place forthose who kill innocent civilians to advance hateful extremism. This weekend, I told PrimeMinister Singh of India that Americans stand with the people of India in this dark time. And Iam confident that India's great democracy is more resilient than killers who would tear itdown. And so, in this uncertain world, the time has come for a new beginning -- a new dawn ofAmerican leadership to overcome the challenges of the 21st century, and to seize theopportunities embedded in those challenges. We will strengthen our capacity to defeat ourenemies and support our friends. We will renew old alliances and forge new and enduringpartnerships. We will show the world once more that America is relentless in the defense ofour people, steady in advancing our interests, and committed to the ideals that shine as abeacon to the world: democracy and justice; opportunity and unyielding hope -- becauseAmerican values are America   s greatest export to the world. To succeed, we must pursue a new strategy that skillfully uses, balances, and integrates allelements of American power: our military and diplomacy; our intelligence and lawenforcement; our economy and the power of our moral example. The team that we'veassembled here today is uniquely suited to do just that. In their past service and plans for the future, these men and women represent all of thoseelements of American power, and the very best of the American example. They've served inuniform and as diplomats; they have worked as legislators, law enforcement officials, andexecutives. They share my pragmatism about the use of power, and my sense of purposeabout America's role as a leader in the world. I have known Hillary Clinton as a friend, a colleague, a source of counsel, and as a campaignopponent. She possesses an extraordinary intelligence and a remarkable work ethic. I amproud that she will be our next Secretary of State. She is an American of tremendous staturewho will have my complete confidence, who knows many of the world's leaders, who willcommand respect in every capitol, and who will clearly have the ability to advance ourinterests around the world. Hillary   s appointment is a sign to friend and foe of the seriousness of my commitment torenew American diplomacy and restore our alliances. There is much to do -- from preventingthe spread of nuclear weapons to Iran and North Korea, to seeking a lasting peace betweenIsrael and the Palestinians, to strengthening international institutions. I have no doubt thatHillary Clinton is the right person to lead our State Department, and to work with me intackling this ambitious foreign policy agenda. At a time when we face unprecedented transition amidst two wars, I've have asked RobertGates to continue as Secretary of Defense, and I'm pleased that he's accepted. Two yearsago, he took over the Pentagon at a difficult time. He restored accountability. He won theconfidence of military commanders and the trust of our brave men and women in uniform, aswell as their families. He earned the respect of members of Congress on both sides of the aislefor his pragmatism and competence. He knows that we need a sustainable national securitystrategy -- and that includes a bipartisan consensus at home. As I said throughout the campaign, I will be giving Secretary Gates and our military a newmission as soon as I take office: responsibly ending the war in Iraq through a successfultransition to Iraqi control. We will also ensure that we have the strategy and resources tosucceed against al Qaeda and the Taliban. As Bob said not too long ago, Afghanistan is wherethe war on terror began, and it is where it must end. And going forward, we will continue tomake the investments necessary to strengthen our military and increase our ground forces todefeat the threats of the 21st century. Eric Holder has the talent and commitment to succeed as Attorney General from his first dayon the job, which is even more important in a transition that demands vigilance. He hasdistinguished himself as a prosecutor, a judge, and a senior official, and he is deeply familiarwith the law enforcement challenges we face -- from terrorism to counter-intelligence, fromwhite collar crime to public corruption. Eric also has the combination of toughness andindependence that we need at the Justice Department. Let me be clear: The Attorney Generalserves the American people. And I have every expectation that Eric will protect our people,uphold the public trust, and adhere to our Constitution. Janet Napolitano offers the experience and executive skills we need in the next Secretary ofHomeland Security. She has spent her career protecting people -- as a US Attorney, anAttorney General, and as the Governor of Arizona. She understands the need for aDepartment of Homeland Security that has the capacity to help prevent terrorist attacks andrespond to catastrophe -- be it manmade or natural. Janet assumes this critical role havinglearned the lessons -- some of them painful -- of the last several years, from 9/11 to Katrina.She insists on competence and accountability. She knows firsthand the need to have a partnerin Washington that works well with state and local governments. She understands as well asanyone the danger of an unsecure border. And she will be a leader who can reform asprawling Department while safeguarding our homeland. Susan Rice will take on the crucial task of serving as Permanent Representative of the UnitedStates to the United Nations. Susan has been a close and trusted advisor. As in previousAdministrations, the UN Ambassador will serve as a member of my cabinet and an integralmember of my team. Her background as a scholar, on the National Security Council, andAssistant Secretary of State will serve our nation well at the United Nations. Susan knows thatthe global challenges we face demand global institutions that work. She shares my belief thatthe UN is an indispensable and imperfect forum. She will carry the message that ourcommitment to multilateral action must be coupled with a commitment to reform. We needthe United Nations to be more effective as a venue for collective action -- against terror andproliferation, climate change and genocide, poverty and disease. Finally, I am convinced that General James Jones is uniquely suited to be a strong and skilledNational Security Advisor. Generations of Joneses have served heroically on the battlefield --from the beaches of Tarawa in World War II, to Foxtrot Ridge in Vietnam. Jim's Silver Star is aproud part of that legacy. He will bring to the job the dual experience of serving in uniformand as a diplomat. He has commanded a platoon in battle, served as Supreme AlliedCommander in a time of war, and worked on behalf of peace in the Middle East. Jim is focusedon the threats of today and the future. He understands the connection between energy andnational security, and has worked on the frontlines of global instability     from Kosovo tonorthern Iraq to Afghanistan. He will advise me and work effectively to integrate our effortsacross the government, so that we are effectively using all elements of American power todefeat unconventional threats and promote our values. I am confident that this team is what we need to make a new beginning for American nationalsecurity. This morning, we met to discuss the situation in Mumbai and some of the challengesthat we face in the months and years ahead. In the coming weeks, I will be in close contactwith these advisors, who will be working with their counterparts in the Bush Administration tomake sure that we are ready to hit the ground running on January 20th. Given the range ofthreats that we face and the vulnerability that can be a part of every presidential transition, Ihope that we can proceed swiftly for those national security officials who demandconfirmation. We move forward with the humility that comes with knowing that there are brave men andwomen protecting us on our front lines: diplomats and intelligence officers in dangerouscorners of the world, troops serving their second, third, or fourth tours; FBI agents in thefield, cops on the beat, prosecutors in our courts, and cargo inspectors at our ports. Theseselfless Americans whose names are unknown to most of us will form the backbone of oureffort. If we serve as well as they are serving, we will protect our country and promote ourvalues. And as we move forward with respect for America's tradition of a bipartisan national securitypolicy and a commitment to national unity, we have to recall that when it comes to keepingour nation and our people safe, we are not Republicans or Democrats: We are Americans. There's no monopoly of power or wisdom in either party. Together, as one nation, as onepeople, we can shape our times instead of being shaped by them. Together, we will meet thechallenges of the 21st century not with fear, but with hope.",obama
"Morning,  everybody.   Last  week,  Vice  President  Elect  Biden  and  I  began  the  process  of  announcing  our  economic   team.  Today,  we  are  pleased  to  name  another  key  member  of  this  team:  our  nominee  for   Secretary  of  Commerce,  my  great  friend,  Governor  Bill  Richardson.   With  each  passing  day,  the  work  our  team  has  begun,  developing  plans  to  revive  our   economy,  becomes  more  urgent.  Earlier  this  week,  we  learned  that  the  U.S.  economy  has   been  in  recession  since  December  of  2007  and  that  our  manufacturing  output  is  at  a  26  year   low        two  stark  reminders  of  the  magnitude  of  the  challenges  we  face.   But  while  I  know  rebuilding  our  economy  won   t  be  easy        and  it  won   t  be        happen  overnight         I  also  know  this:  that  right  now,  somewhere  in  America,  a  small  business  is  at  work  with   the  next  big  idea    a  scientist  is  on  the  cusp  of  the  next  big  breakthrough  discovery    an   entrepreneur  is  sketching  plans  for  the  startup  that  will  revolutionize  an  industry.  Right  now,   across  America,  the  finest  products  in  the  world  are  rolling  off  our  assembly  lines.  And  the   proudest,  most  determined,  most  productive  workers  in  the  world  are  on  the  job        some,   already  on  their  second  shift  of  the  day    many,  putting  in  longer  hours  than  ever  before.   After  nearly  two  years  of  traveling  across  this  country,  meeting  with  workers,  visiting   businesses  large  and  small,  I  am  more  confident  than  ever  that  we  have  everything  we  need   to  renew  our  economy.  We've  got  the  ingenuity,  the  technology,  the  skill,  and  commitment     we  just  need  to  put  it  to  work. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Property  of  .       Copyright  2008.  All  rights  reserved.   Page  1      It   s  time  to  not  just  address  the  immediate  economic  threats,  but  to  start  laying  the   groundwork  for  long  term  prosperity  to  help  American  businesses  grow  and  thrive  at  home,   and  expand  our  efforts  to  promote  American  enterprise  around  the  world.   This  work  is  the  core  mission  of  the  Secretary  of  Commerce.  And  with  his  breadth  and  depth   of  experience  in  public  life,  Governor  Richardson  is  uniquely  suited  for  this  role  as  a  leading   economic  diplomat  for  America.  During  his  time  in  state  government  and  Congress,  and  in   tour        two  tours  of  duty  in  the  cabinet,  Bill  has  seen  from  just  about  every  angle  what  makes   our  economy  work  and  what  keeps  it  from  working  better.   As  Governor  of  New  Mexico,  Bill  showed  how  government  can  act  as  a  partner  to  support  our   businesses,  helping  to  create  80,000  new  jobs.  And  under  his  leadership,  New  Mexico  saw  the   lowest  unemployment  rate  in  decades.   As  a  former  Secretary  of  Energy,  Bill  understands  the  steps  we  must  take  to  build  a  new,   clean  energy  industry  and  create  the  green  jobs  of  the  twenty  first  century         jobs  that  pay   well  and  won   t  be  outsourced    jobs  that  will  help  us  end  our  dependence  on  foreign  oil.   And  as  a  former  Ambassador  to  the  United  Nations,  Bill  brings  both  international  stature  and  a   deep  understanding  of  today   s  global  economy.  He  understands  that  the  success  of  today   s   business  in  Detroit  or  Columbus  often  depends  on  whether  it  can  sell  products  in  places  like   Santiago  or  Shanghai.  And  he  knows  that  America   s  reputation  in  the  world  is  critical  not  just   to  our  security,  but  to  our  prosperity        (excuse  me)        that  when  the  citizens  of  the  world   respect  America   s  leadership,  they  are  more  likely  to  buy  America   s  products.   To  this  crucial  work  of  restoring  America   s  international  standing,  Bill  will  bring  a  leadership   style  all  his  own.  Bill  has  never  been  content  to  just  learn  from  briefing  books,  never  satisfied   with  only  the  official  version  of  the  story.  During  his  time  in  Congress,  he  held  more  than  two         2,500  town  hall  meetings,  so  he  could  hear  directly  from  constituents.  He  was  a  regular  in   the  U.N.  cafeteria,  mixing  it  up  with  U.N.  employees  over  lunch.  And  during  his  2002   campaign  for  record        for  Governor,  he  actually  broke  a  world  record  by  shaking  nearly   14,000  hands  in  just  eight  hours.   (I've  got  to  check  that  statistic.)   All  of  this  reflects  a  determination  to  reach  out  and  understand  where  people  are  coming   from,  what  they  hope  for,  and  what  he  can  do  to  help.  This  approach,  I  believe,  has  been  the   key  to  Bill   s  success  as  a  negotiator  and  will  be  key  to  his  work  on  the  critical  functions  of  the   Commerce  Department        from  administering  our  census  and  monitoring  our  climate  to   protecting  our  intellectual  property  and  restoring  our  economic  diplomacy.   In  the  end,  Bill  Richardson  is  a  leader  who  shares  my  values,  and  he  must        and  he  will  be   measured  his  progress  the  same  way  I  do.  Are  we  creating  good  jobs  instead  of  losing  them?   Are  incomes  growing  instead  of  shrinking?  I  know  Bill  will  be  an  unyielding  advocate  for   American  business  and  American  jobs  at  home  and  around  the  world.  And  I  look  forward  to   working  with  him  in  the  years  ahead. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Property  of  .       Copyright  2008.  All  rights  reserved.

"Let me begin by thanking George Mason University for their extraordinary hospitality and tothank all the great friends, the governors, the mayors who are in attendance here today. Throughout America's history, there have been some years that simply rolled into the nextwithout much notice or fanfare. And then there are the years that come along once in ageneration, the kind that mark a clean break from a troubled past and set a new course forour nation. This is one of those years. We start 2009 in the midst of a crisis unlike any we have seen in our lifetime, a crisis that hasonly deepened over the last few weeks. Nearly two million jobs have been now lost. And onFriday, we're likely to learn that we lost more jobs last year than at any time since World WarII. Just in the past year, another 2.8 million Americans who want and need full-time workhave had to settle for part-time jobs. Manufacturing has hit a 28-year low. Many businessescannot borrow or make payroll. Many families cannot pay their bills or their mortgage. Manyworkers are watching their life savings disappear. And many, many Americans are bothanxious and uncertain of what the future will hold. Now, I don't believe it's too late to change course, but it will be if we don't take dramaticaction as soon as possible. If nothing is done, this recession could linger for years. Theunemployment rate could reach double digits. Our economy could fall 1 trillion dollars short ofits full capacity, which translates into more than 12,000 dollars in lost income for a family offour. We could lose a generation of potential and promise as more young Americans are forced toforego dreams of college or the chance to train for the jobs of the future. And our nation couldlose the competitive edge that has served as a foundation for our strength and our standing inthe world. In short, a bad situation could become dramatically worse. This crisis did not happen solely by some accident of history or normal turn of the businesscycle. And we won't get out of it by simply waiting for a better day to come or relying on theworn-out dogmas of the past. We arrived at this point due to an era of profoundirresponsibility that stretched from corporate board rooms to the halls of power inWashington, D.C. For years, too many Wall Street executives made imprudent and dangerous decisions, seekingprofits with too little regard for risk, too little regulatory scrutiny, and too little accountability.Banks made loans without concern for whether borrowers could repay them, and someborrowers took advantage of cheap credit to take on debt they couldn't afford. Politiciansspent taxpayer money without wisdom or discipline and too often focused on scoring politicalpoints instead of problems they were sent here to solve. The result has been a devastatingloss of trust and confidence in our economy, our financial markets, and our government. Now, the very fact that this crisis is largely of our own making means that it's not beyond ourability to solve. Our problems are rooted in past mistakes, not our capacity for futuregreatness. It will take time -- perhaps many years -- but we can rebuild that lost trust andconfidence. We can restore opportunity and prosperity. We should never forget that ourworkers are still more productive than any on Earth. Our universities are still the envy of theworld. We are still home to the most brilliant minds, the most creative entrepreneurs, and themost advanced technology and innovation that history has ever known. And we are still thenation that has overcome great fears and improbable odds. If we act with the urgency andseriousness that this moment requires, I know that we can do it again. That is why I have moved quickly to work with my economic team and leaders of both partieson an American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan that will immediately jump-start job creationand long-term growth. It's a plan that represents not just new policy, but a whole newapproach to meeting our most urgent challenges. For if we hope to end this crisis, we mustend the culture of anything goes that helped create it, and this change must begin inWashington. It's time to trade old habits for a new spirit of responsibility. It's time to finallychange the ways of Washington so that we can set a new and better course for America. There is no doubt that the cost of this plan will be considerable. It will certainly add to thebudget deficit in the short term. But equally certain are the consequences of doing too little ornothing at all, for that will lead to an even greater deficit of jobs, incomes, and confidence inour economy. It is true that we cannot depend on government alone to create jobs or long-term growth. Butat this particular moment, only government can provide the short-term boost necessary to liftus from a recession this deep and severe. Only government can break the cycle that are [sic]crippling our economy, where a lack of spending leads to lost jobs, which leads to even lessspending, where an inability to lend and borrow stops growth and leads to even less credit.That's why we need to act boldly and act now to reverse these cycles. That's why we need toput money in the pockets of the American people, create new jobs, and invest in our future.That's why we need to restart the flow of credit and restore the rules of the road that willensure a crisis like this never happens again. Now this plan begins with -- this plan must begin today, a plan I am confident will save orcreate at least three million jobs over the next few years. It's not just another public worksprogram. It's a plan that recognizes both the paradox and promise of this moment: the factthat there are millions of Americans trying to find work, even as all around the country there'sso much work to be done. And that's why we'll invest in priorities like energy and education,health care and a new infrastructure that are necessary to keep us strong and competitive inthe 21st century. That's why the overwhelming majority of the jobs created will be in theprivate sector, while our plan will save the public sector jobs of teachers, police officers,firefighters, and others who provide vital services. To finally spark the creation of a clean energy economy, we will double the production ofalternative energy in the next three years. We will modernize more than 75 percent of federalbuildings and improve the energy efficiency of 2 million American homes, saving consumersand taxpayers billions on our energy bills. In the process, we will put Americans to work in new jobs that pay well and can't beoutsourced, jobs building solar panels and wind turbines, constructing fuel-efficient cars andbuildings, and developing the new energy technologies that will lead to even more jobs, moresavings, and a cleaner, safer planet in the bargain. To improve the quality of our health care while lowering its cost, we will make the immediateinvestments necessary to ensure that, within five years, all of America's medical records arecomputerized. This will cut waste, eliminate red tape and reduce the need to repeat expensivemedical tests. But it just won't save billions of dollars and thousands of jobs; it will save livesby reducing the deadly but preventable medical errors that pervade our health care system. To give our children the chance to live out their dreams in a world that's never been morecompetitive, we will equip tens of thousands of schools, community colleges, and publicuniversities with 21st century classrooms, labs, and libraries. We'll provide new computers,new technology, and new training for teachers so that students in Chicago and Boston cancompete with children in Beijing for the high-tech, high-wage jobs of the future. To build an economy that can lead this future, we will begin to rebuild America. Yes, we'll putpeople to work repairing crumbling roads, bridges, and schools by eliminating the backlog ofwell-planned, worthy, and needed infrastructure projects. But we'll also do more to retrofitAmerica for a global economy. That means updating the way we get our electricity by startingto build a new smart grid that will save us money, protect our power sources from blackout orattack, and deliver clean, alternative forms of energy to every corner of our nation. It meansexpanding broadband lines across America, so that a small business in a rural town canconnect and compete with their counterparts anywhere in the world. It means investing in thescience, research, and technology that will lead to new medical breakthroughs, newdiscoveries, and entire new industries. And finally, this recovery and reinvestment plan will provide immediate relief to states,workers, and families who are bearing the brunt of this recession. To get people spendingagain, 95% of working families will receive a thousand dollar tax cut -- the first stage of amiddle-class tax cut that I promised during the campaign and will include in our next budget.To help Americans who have lost their jobs and can't find new ones, we'll continue thebipartisan extension of unemployment insurance and health care coverage to help themthrough this crisis. Government at every level will have to tighten its belt, but we'll helpstruggling states avoid harmful budget cuts, as long as they take responsibility and use themoney to maintain essential services like police, fire, education, and health care. Now I understand that some might be skeptical of this plan. Our government has alreadyspent a good deal of money, but we haven't yet seen that translate into more jobs or higherincomes or renewed confidence in our economy. And that's why the American Recovery andReinvestment Plan won't just throw money at our problems; we'll invest in what works. Thetrue test of policies we'll pursue won't be whether they're Democratic or Republican ideas,whether they're conservative or liberal ideas, but whether they create jobs, grow oureconomy, and put the American Dream within the reach of the American people. Instead of politicians doling out money behind a veil of secrecy, decisions about where weinvest will be made transparently, and informed by independent experts wherever possible.Every American will be able to hold Washington accountable for these decisions by goingonline to see how and where their taxpayer dollars are being spent. And as I announcedyesterday, we will launch an unprecedented effort to eliminate unwise and unnecessaryspending that has never been more unaffordable for our nation and our children's future thanit is right now. We have to make tough choices and smart investments today so that as the economyrecovers, the deficits start coming down. We cannot have a solid recovery if our people andour businesses don't have confidence that we're getting our fiscal house in order. And that'swhy our goal is not to create a slew of new government programs, but a foundation for long- term economic growth. That also means an economic recovery plan that is free from earmarksand pet projects. I understand that every member of Congress has ideas about how to spendmoney. Many of these projects are worthy. They benefit local communities. But this emergency legislation must not be the vehicle for those aspirations. This must be atime when leaders in both parties put the urgent needs of our nation above our own narrowinterests. Now, this recovery plan alone will not solve all the problems that led us into this crisis. Wemust also work with the same sense of urgency to stabilize and repair the financial system weall depend on. That means using our full arsenal of tools to get credit flowing again to familiesand businesses, while restoring confidence in our markets. It means launching a sweepingeffort to address the foreclosure crisis so that we can keep responsible families in their homes.It means preventing the catastrophic failure of financial institutions whose collapse couldendanger the entire economy, but only with maximum protections for taxpayers and a clearunderstanding that government support for any company is an extraordinary action that mustcome with significant restrictions on the firms that receive support. And it means reforming aweak and outdated regulatory system so that we can better withstand financial shocks andbetter protect consumers, investors, and businesses from the reckless greed and risk-takingthat must never endanger our prosperity again. No longer can we allow Wall Street wrongdoers to slip through regulatory cracks. No longercan we allow special interests to put their thumbs on the economic scales. No longer can weallow the unscrupulous lending and borrowing that leads only to destructive cycles of bubbleand bust. It is time to set a new course for this economy, and that change must begin now. We should have an open and honest discussion about this recovery plan in the days ahead,but I urge Congress to move as quickly as possible on behalf of the American people. Forevery day we wait or point fingers or drag our feet, more Americans will lose their jobs. Morefamilies will lose their savings. More dreams will be deferred and denied. And our nation willsink deeper into a crisis that, at some point, we may not be able to reverse. That is not the country I know. It is not a future I accept as President of the United States. Aworld that depends on the strength of our economy is now watching and waiting for Americato lead once more. And that is what we will do. It will not come easy or happen overnight, and it is altogether likely that things may get worsebefore they get better. But that is all the more reason for Congress to act without delay. Iknow the scale of this plan is unprecedented, but so is the severity of our situation. We havealready tried the wait-and-see approach to our problems, and it is the same approach thathelped lead us to this day of reckoning. And that is why the time has come to build a 21st century economy in which hard work andresponsibility are once again rewarded. That's why I'm asking Congress to work with me andmy team day and night, on weekends if necessary, to get the plan passed in the next fewweeks. That's why I'm calling on all Americans -- Democrats and Republicans and Independents -- toput -- to put good ideas ahead of the old ideological battles; a sense of common purposeabove the same narrow partisanship; and insist that the first question each of us asks isn't,""What's good for me?"" but ""What's good for the country my children will inherit?"" More than any program or policy, it is this spirit that will enable us to confront thesechallenges with the same spirit that has led previous generations to face down war, anddepression, and fear itself. And if we do, if we are able to summon that spirit again, if we areable to look out for one another, and listen to one another, and do our part for our nation andfor posterity, then I have no doubt that years from now, we will look back on 2009 as one ofthose years that marked another new and hopeful beginning for the United States of America. Thank you, God Bless You, and may God Bless America.",obama
"Hello  America!   I  want  to  thank  all  the  speakers  and  performers  today  for  reminding  us,  through  song  and   through  words,  just  what  it  is  that  we  love  about  America.  I  want  to  thank  all  of  you  for   braving  the  cold  and  the  crowds  and  traveling  in  some  cases  thousands  of  miles  to  join  us   here  today.  Welcome  to  Washington,  and  welcome  to  this  celebration  of  American  renewal.   In  the  course  of  our  history,  only  a  handful  of  generations  have  been  asked  to  confront   challenges  as  serious  as  the  ones  we  face  right  now.  Our  nation  is  at  war.  Our  economy  is  in   crisis.  Millions  of  Americans  are  losing  their  jobs  and  their  homes.  They're  worried  about  how   they'll  afford  college  for  their  kids  or  pay  the  stack  of  bills  on  their  kitchen  table.  And  most  of   all,  they're  anxious  and  uncertain  about  the  future        about  whether  this  generation  of   Americans  will  be  able  to  pass  on  what's  best  about  this  country  to  our  children  and  their   children.   I  won't  pretend  that  meeting  any  one  of  these  challenges  will  be  easy.  It  will  take  more  than  a   month  or  a  year,  and  it  will  likely  take  many.  Along  the  way  there  will  be  setbacks  and  false   starts  and  days  that  test  our  resolve  as  a  nation.   But  despite  all  this        despite  the  enormity  of  the  task  that  lies  ahead        I  stand  here  today  as   hopeful  as  ever  that  the  United  States  of  America  will  endure,  that  it  will  prevail,  that  the   dream  of  our  Founders  will  live  on  in  our  time.

Page  1      What  gives  me  hope  is  what  I  see  when  I  look  out  across  this  mall.  For  in  these  monuments   are  chiseled  those  unlikely  stories  that  affirm  our  unyielding  faith        a  faith  that  anything  is   possible  in  America.  Rising  before  us  stands  a  memorial  to  a  man  who  led  a  small  band  of   farmers  and  shopkeepers  in  revolution  against  the  army  of  an  empire,  all  for  the  sake  of  an   idea.   On  the  ground  below  is  a  tribute  to  a  generation  that  withstood  war  and  depression        men   and  women  like  my  grandparents  who  toiled  on  bomber  assembly  lines  and  marched  across   Europe  to  free  the  world  from  tyranny's  grasp.  Directly  in  front  of  us  is  a  pool  that  still  reflects   the  dream  of  a  King,  and  the  glory  of  a  people  who  marched  and  bled  so  that  their  children   might  be  judged  by  their  character's  content.  And  behind  me,  watching  over  the  union  he   saved,  sits  the  man  who  in  so  many  ways  made  this  day  possible.   And  yet,  as  I  stand  here  today,  what  gives  me  the  greatest  hope  of  all  is  not  the  stone  and   marble  that  surrounds  us,  but  what  fills  the  spaces  in  between.  It  is  you        Americans  of  every   race  and  region  and  station  who  came  here  because  you  believe  in  what  this  country  can  be   and  because  you  want  to  help  us  get  there.   It's  the  same  thing  that  gave  me  hope  from  the  day  we  began  this  campaign  for  the   presidency  nearly  two  years  ago:  a  belief  that  if  we  could  just  recognize  ourselves  in  one   another  and  bring  everyone  together        Democrats,  Republicans,  Independents    Latino,  Asian   and  Native  American    black  and  white,  gay  and  straight,  disabled  and  then  not  only  would  we   restore  hope  and  opportunity  in  places  that  yearned  for  both,  but  maybe,  just  maybe,  we   might  perfect  our  union  in  the  process.   This  is  what  I  believed,  but  you  made  this  belief  real.  You  proved  once  more  that  people  who   love  this  country  can  change  it.  And  as  I  prepare  to  assume  the  presidency,  yours  are  the   voices  I  will  take  with  me  every  day  when  I  walk  into  that  Oval  Office        the  voices  of  men  and   women  who  have  different  stories  but  hold  common  hopes    who  ask  only  for  what  was   promised  us  as  Americans        that  we  might  make  of  our  lives  what  we  will  and  see  our   children  climb  higher  than  we  did.   It  is  this  thread  that  binds  us  together  in  common  effort    that  runs  through  every  memorial  on   this  mall    that  connects  us  to  all  those  who  struggled  and  sacrificed  and  stood  here  before.  It   is  how  this  nation  has  overcome  the  greatest  differences  and  the  longest  odds        because   there  is  no  obstacle  that  can  stand  in  the  way  of  millions  of  voices  calling  for  change.  That  is   the  belief  with  which  we  began  this  campaign,  and  that  is  how  we  will  overcome  what  ails  us   now.   There  is  no  doubt  that  our  road  will  be  long,  that  our  climb  will  be  steep.  But  never  forget  that   the  true  character  of  our  nation  is  revealed  not  during  times  of  comfort  and  ease,  but  by  the   right  we  do  when  the  moment  is  hard.  I  ask  you  to  help  reveal  that  character  once  more,  and   together,  we  can  carry  forward  as  one  nation,  and  one  people,  the  legacy  of  our  forefathers   that  we  celebrate  today.   Thank  you,  America.  God  bless  you. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Property  of  .       Copyright  2009.  All  rights  reserved.   Page  2  ",obama
"[Chief Justice John G. Roberts administers the Oath of Office] I, Barack Hussein Obama, do solemnly swear that I will execute the office of the President of theUnited States faithfully1, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend theConstitution of the United States, so help me God. Thank you, thank you. My fellow citizens: I stand here today humbled by the task before us, grateful for the trust you've bestowed,mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors. I thank President Bush for his service to ournation, as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition. Forty-four Americans have now taken the presidential Oath. The words have been spokenduring rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace. Yet, every so often the Oath istaken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms. Transcription date 2015 by Michael E. Eidenmuller. Copyright Status: Property of At these moments, America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those inhigh office, but because We the People have remained faithful to the ideals of our forebearers[sic], and true to our founding documents. So it has been. So it must be with this generation of Americans. That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood. Our nation is at war, against a far- reaching network of violence and hatred. Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence ofgreed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hardchoices and prepare the nation for a new age. Homes have been lost; jobs shed; businessesshuttered. Our health care is too costly; our schools fail too many; and each day bringsfurther evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten ourplanet. These are the indicators of crisis, subject to data and statistics. Less measurable, but no lessprofound, is a sapping of confidence across our land -- a nagging fear that America's decline isinevitable, that the next generation must lower its sights. Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real. They are serious and they are many.They will not be met easily or in a short span of time. But know this, America: They will bemet. On this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflictand discord. On this day, we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises, therecriminations and worn out dogmas, that for far too long have strangled our politics. We remain a young nation, but in the words of Scripture, the time has come to ""set asidechildish things.""2 The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit; to choose our betterhistory; to carry forward that precious gift, that noble idea, passed on from generation togeneration: the God-given promise that all are equal, all are free, and all deserve a chance topursue their full measure of happiness. In reaffirming the greatness of our nation, we understand that greatness is never a given. Itmust be earned. Our journey has never been one of short-cuts or settling for less. It has notbeen the path for the faint-hearted -- for those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only thepleasures of riches and fame. Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers ofthings -- some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor, who havecarried us up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and freedom. For us, they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of anew life. Transcription date 2015 by Michael E. Eidenmuller. Copyright Status: Property of For us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West; endured the lash of the whip andplowed the hard earth. For us, they fought and died, in places like Concord and Gettysburg; Normandy and Khe Sahn. Time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their handswere raw so that we might live a better life. They saw America as bigger than the sum of ourindividual ambitions; greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction. This is the journey we continue today. We remain the most prosperous, powerful nation onEarth. Our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began. Our minds are no lessinventive, our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month orlast year. Our capacity remains undiminished. But our time of standing pat, of protectingnarrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions - that time has surely passed. Startingtoday, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remakingAmerica. For everywhere we look, there is work to be done. The state of our economy calls for action,bold and swift, and we will act -- not only to create new jobs, but to lay a new foundation forgrowth. We will build the roads and bridges, the electric grids and digital lines that feed ourcommerce and bind us together. We will restore science to its rightful place, and wieldtechnology's wonders to raise health care's quality and lower its cost. We will harness the sunand the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories. And we will transform ourschools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age. All this we can do. All this we will do. Now, there are some who question the scale of our ambitions -- who suggest that our systemcannot tolerate too many big plans. Their memories are short. For they have forgotten whatthis country has already done; what free men and women can achieve when imagination isjoined to common purpose, and necessity to courage. What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them -- that thestale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply. The question weask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works --whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that isdignified. Where the answer is yes, we intend to move forward. Where the answer is no,programs will end. And those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to account --to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do our business in the light of day -- because onlythen can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government. Transcription date 2015 by Michael E. Eidenmuller. Copyright Status: Property of Nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill. Its power togenerate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched, but this crisis has reminded us thatwithout a watchful eye, the market can spin out of control. The nation cannot prosper longwhen it favors only the prosperous. The success of our economy has always depended not juston the size of our Gross Domestic Product, but on the reach of our prosperity; on the ability toextend opportunity to every willing heart -- not out of charity, but because it is the surestroute to our common good. As for our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals.Our Founding Fathers, faced with perils that we can scarcely imagine, drafted a charter toassure the rule of law and the rights of man, a charter expanded by the blood of generations.Those ideals still light the world, and we will not give them up for expedience'[s] sake. And soto all the other peoples and governments who are watching today, from the grandest capitalsto the small village where my father was born: Know that America is a friend of each nationand every man, woman, and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity. And we are readyto lead once more. Recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles andtanks, but with the sturdy alliances and enduring convictions. They understood that our poweralone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please. Instead, they knew that ourpower grows through its prudent use; our security emanates from the justness of our cause,the force of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and restraint. We are the keepers of this legacy. Guided by these principles once more, we can meet thosenew threats that demand even greater effort -- even greater cooperation and understandingbetween nations. We will begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its people, and forge a hard- earned peace in Afghanistan. With old friends and former foes, we will work tirelessly tolessen the nuclear threat, and roll back the specter of a warming planet. We will not apologizefor our way of life, nor will we waver in its defense, and for those who seek to advance theiraims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit isstronger and cannot be broken. You cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you! For we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness. We are a nation ofChristians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus -- and non-believers. We are shaped by everylanguage and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth; and because we have tasted thebitter swill of civil war and segregation, and emerged from that dark chapter stronger andmore united, we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that thelines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as the world grows smaller, our common humanity shallreveal itself; and that America must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace. To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutualrespect. To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society'sills on the West -- know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what youdestroy. Transcription date 2015 by Michael E. Eidenmuller. Copyright Status: Property of To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, knowthat you are on the wrong side of history; but that we will extend a hand if you are willing tounclench your fist. To the people of poor nations, we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourishand let clean waters flow; to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds. And to thosenations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can no longer afford indifference to thesuffering outside our borders; nor can we consume the world's resources without regard toeffect. For the world has changed, and we must change with it. As we consider the road that unfolds before us, we remember with humble gratitude thosebrave Americans who, at this very hour, patrol far-off deserts and distant mountains. Theyhave something to tell us, just as the fallen heroes who lie in Arlington whisper through theages. We honor them not only because they are the guardians of our liberty, but because theyembody the spirit of service; a willingness to find meaning in something greater thanthemselves. And yet, at this moment -- a moment that will define a generation -- it isprecisely this spirit that must inhabit us all. For as much as government can do and must do, it is ultimately the faith and determination ofthe American people upon which this nation relies. It is the kindness to take in a strangerwhen the levees break, the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than seea friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours. It is the firefighter's courageto storm a stairway filled with smoke, but also a parent's willingness to nurture a child, thatfinally decides our fate. Our challenges may be new. The instruments with which we meet them may be new. Butthose values upon which our success depends -- honesty and hard work, courage and fairplay, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism -- these things are old. These things aretrue. They have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history. What is demandedthen is a return to these truths. What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility -- arecognition, on the part of every American, that we have duties to ourselves, our nation, andthe world, duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in theknowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit, so defining of our character, thangiving our all to a difficult task. This is the price and the promise of citizenship. This is the source of our confidence -- the knowledge that God calls on us to shape anuncertain destiny. This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed -- why men and women and children of everyrace and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall, and why a manwhose father less than sixty years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant cannow stand before you to take a most sacred Oath.

Inthe year of America's birth, in the coldest of months, a small band of patriots huddled bydying campfires on the shores of an icy river. The Capitol was abandoned. The enemy wasadvancing. The snow was stained with blood. At a moment when the outcome of ourrevolution was most in doubt, the father of our nation ordered these words be read to thepeople: Let it be told to the future world...that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hopeand virtue could survive...that the city and the country, alarmed at one commondanger, came forth to meet [it]. America: In the face of our common dangers, in this winter of our hardship, let us rememberthese timeless words. With hope and virtue, let us brave once more the icy currents, andendure what storms may come. Let it be said by our children's children that when we weretested we refused to let this journey end, that we did not turn back nor did we falter; and witheyes fixed on the horizon and God's grace upon us, we carried forth that great gift of freedomand delivered it safely to future generations.

"Let me first of all say how grateful I am for all of you being here, and how much weappreciate everything that you've done. I know that there are a lot of people here who havebeen so engaged in the campaign, have sacrificed so much, people who've been involved backsince 2007. And...so I...want all of you to know how appreciative I am. And I know many of you came here today for a campaign event. I was looking forward tohaving a fun conversation with you about some really important matters that we face as acountry and the differences between myself and my opponent in this election. But this morning, we woke up to news of a tragedy that reminds us of all the ways that weare united as one American family. By now, many of you know, many of you have heard that a few miles outside of Denver, in atown call Aurora, at least 12 people were killed when a gunman opened fire in a movietheater, and dozens more are being treated for injuries at a local hospital. Some of the victimsare being treated at a children   s hospital. Now, we   re still gathering all the facts about what happened in Aurora, but what we do knowis that the police have one suspect in custody. And the federal government stands ready to dowhatever is necessary to bring whoever is responsible for this heinous crime to justice -- andwe will take every step possible to ensure the safety of all of our people. We're going to stand by our neighbors in Colorado during this extraordinarily difficult time.And I had a chance to speak with the Mayor of Aurora as well as the Governor of Colorado toexpress, not just on behalf of Michelle and myself, but the entire American family, howheartbroken we are. Now, even as we learn how this happened and who's responsible, we may never understandwhat leads anybody to terrorize their fellow human beings like this. Such violence, such evil issenseless. It's beyond reason. But while we will never know fully what causes somebody to take the life of another, we doknow what makes life worth living. The people we lost in Aurora loved and they were loved.They were mothers and fathers; they were husbands and wives; sisters and brothers; sonsand daughters, friends and neighbors. They had hopes for the future and they had dreamsthat were not yet fulfilled. And if there   s anything to take away from this tragedy it   s the reminder that life is very fragile.Our time here is limited and it is precious. And what matters at the end of the day is not thesmall things; it   s not the trivial things, which so often consume us and our daily lives.Ultimately, it   s how we choose to treat one another and how we love one another. It's what we do on a daily basis to give our lives meaning and to give our lives purpose. That   swhat matters. At the end of the day, what we   ll remember will be those we loved and what wedid for others. That   s why we   re here. I   m sure that many of you who are parents here had the same reaction that I did when Iheard this news. My daughters go to the movies. What if Malia and Sasha had been at thetheater, as so many of our kids do every day? Michelle and I will be fortunate enough to hugour girls a little tighter tonight, and I   m sure you will do the same with your children. But forthose parents who may not be so lucky, we have to embrace them and let them know we willbe there for them as a nation. So, again, I am so grateful that all of you are here. I am...so moved by your support. Butthere are going to be other days for politics. This, I think, is a day for prayer and reflection. So what I   d ask everybody to do, I   d like us to pause in a moment of silence for the victims ofthis terrible tragedy, for the people who knew them and loved them, for those who are stillstruggling to recover, and for all the victims of less publicized acts of violence that plague ourcommunities every single day. So if everybody can just take a moment. [Silence observed] Thank you, everybody. I hope all of you will keep the people of Aurora in your hearts and minds today. May the Lordbring them comfort and healing in hard days to come. I am grateful to all of you, and I hope that as a consequence of today   s events, as you leavehere, you spend a little time thinking about the incredible blessings that God has given us.

"In short, if we do not act boldly and swiftly, a bad situation could become dramatically worse. That is why I have proposed an American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan to immediatelyjumpstart job creation as well as long-term economic growth. I am pleased to say that bothparties in Congress are already hard at work on this plan, and I hope to sign it into law in lessthan a month. It   s a plan that will save or create three to four million jobs over the next few years, and onethat recognizes both the paradox and the promise of this moment -- the fact that there aremillions of Americans trying to find work even as, all around the country, there   s so muchwork to be done. That   s why this is not just a short-term program to boost employment. It   sone that will invest in our most important priorities like energy and education; health care anda new infrastructure that are necessary to keep us strong and competitive in the 21st century. Today I   d like to talk specifically about the progress we expect to make in each of these areas. To accelerate the creation of a clean energy economy, we will double our capacity to generatealternative sources of energy like wind, solar, and biofuels over the next three years. We   llbegin to build a new electricity grid that lay down more than 3,000 miles of transmission linesto convey this new energy from coast to coast. We   ll save taxpayers $2 billion a year bymaking 75% of federal buildings more energy efficient, and save the average working family$350 on their energy bills by weatherizing 2.5 million homes. To lower health care cost, cut medical errors, and improve care, we   ll computerize the nation   shealth record in five years, saving billions of dollars in health care costs and countless lives.And we   ll protect health insurance for more than 8 million Americans who are in danger oflosing their coverage during this economic downturn. To ensure our children can compete and succeed in this new economy, we   ll renovate andmodernize 10,000 schools, building state-of-the-art classrooms, libraries, and labs to improvelearning for over five million students. We   ll invest more in Pell Grants to make collegeaffordable for seven million more students, provide a $2,500 college tax credit to four millionstudents, and triple the number of fellowships in science to help spur the next generation ofinnovation. Finally, we will rebuild and retrofit America to meet the demands of the 21st century. Thatmeans repairing and modernizing thousands of miles of America   s roadways and providingnew mass transit options for millions of Americans. It means protecting America by securing90 major ports and creating a better communications network for local law enforcement andpublic safety officials in the event of an emergency. And it means expanding broadbandaccess to millions of Americans, so business can compete on a level-playing field, whereverthey   re located. I know that some are skeptical about the size and scale of this recovery plan. I understandthat skepticism, which is why this recovery plan must and will include unprecedentedmeasures that will allow the American people to hold my Administration accountable for theseresults. We won   t just throw money at our problems -- we   ll invest in what works. Instead ofpoliticians doling out money behind a veil of secrecy, decisions about where we invest will bemade public, and informed by independent experts whenever possible. We   ll launch anunprecedented effort to root out waste, inefficiency, and unnecessary spending in ourgovernment, and every American will be able to see how and where we spend taxpayerdollars by going to a new website called recovery.gov. No one policy or program will solve the challenges we face right now, nor will this crisis recedein a short period of time. But if we act now and act boldly; if we start rewarding hard workand responsibility once more; if we act as citizens and not partisans and begin again the workof remaking America, then I have faith that we will emerge from this trying time evenstronger and more prosperous than we were before.

"Good morning President Taylor, Board of Trustees, faculty, parents, family, friends, thecommunity of Galesburg, the class of 1955 -- which I understand was out partying last night,and yet still showed up here on time -- and most of all, the Class of 2005. Congratulations onyour graduation, and thank you -- thank you for the honor of allowing me to be a part of it.Thank you also, Mr. President, for this honorary degree. It was only a couple of years ago thatI stopped paying my student loans in law school. Had I known it was this easy, I would haveran [sic] for the United States Senate earlier. You know, it has been about six months now since you sent me to Washington as your UnitedStates Senator. I recognize that not all of you voted for me, so for those of you mutteringunder your breath ""I didn   t send you anywhere,"" that's ok too. Maybe we   ll hold -- What doyou call it? -- a little Pumphandle after the ceremony. Change your mind for the next time. It has been a fascinating journey thus far. Each time I walk onto the Senate floor, I'mreminded of the history, for good and for ill, that has been made there. But there have been afew surreal moments. For example, I remember the day before I was sworn in, myself and my staff, we decided tohold a press conference in our office. Now, keep in mind that I am ranked 99th in seniority. Iwas proud that I wasn   t ranked dead last until I found out that it   s just because Illinois isbigger than Colorado. So I   m 99th in seniority, and all the reporters are crammed into the tinytransition office that I have, which is right next to the janitor   s closet in the basement of theDirksen Office Building. It   s my first day in the building, I have not taken a single vote, I havenot introduced one bill, had not even sat down in my desk, and this very earnest reporterraises his hand and says:    Senator Obama, what is your place in history?    I did what you just did, which is laugh out loud. I said, ""place in history?"" I thought he waskidding. At that point, I wasn   t even sure the other Senators would save a place for me at thecool kids    table. But as I was thinking about the words to share with this class, about what   s next, aboutwhat   s possible, and what opportunities lay ahead, I actually think it   s not a bad question foryou, the class of 2005, to ask yourselves: What will be your place in history? In other eras, across distant lands, this question could be answered with relative ease andcertainty. As a servant in Rome, you knew you   d spend your life forced to build somebodyelse   s Empire. As a peasant in 11th Century China, you knew that no matter how hard youworked, the local warlord might come and take everything you had -- and you also knew thatfamine might come knocking at the door. As a subject of King George, you knew that yourfreedom of worship and your freedom to speak and to build your own life would be ultimatelylimited by the throne. And then America happened. A place where destiny was not a destination, but a journey to be shared and shaped andremade by people who had the gall, the temerity to believe that, against all odds, they couldform    a more perfect union    on this new frontier. And as people around the world began to hear the tale of the lowly colonists who overthrewan empire for the sake of an idea, they started to come. Across oceans and the ages, theysettled in Boston and Charleston, Chicago and St. Louis, Kalamazoo and Galesburg, to try andbuild their own American Dream. This collective dream moved forward imperfectly -- it wasscarred by our treatment of native peoples, betrayed by slavery, clouded by the subjugationof women, shaken by war and depression. And yet, brick by brick, rail by rail, calloused handby calloused hand, people kept dreaming, and building, and working, and marching, andpetitioning their government, until they made America a land where the question of our placein history is not answered for us. It   s answered by us. Have we failed at times? Absolutely. Will you occasionally fail when you embark on your ownAmerican journey? You surely will. But the test is not perfection.The true test of the American ideal is whether we   re able to recognize our failings and thenrise together to meet the challenges of our time. Whether we allow ourselves to be shaped byevents and history, or whether we act to shape them. Whether chance of birth orcircumstance decides life   s big winners and losers, or whether we build a community where, atthe very least, everyone has a chance to work hard, get ahead, and reach their dreams. We have faced this choice before. At the end of the Civil War, when farmers and their families began moving into the cities towork in the big factories that were sprouting up all across America, we had to decide: Do wedo nothing and allow captains of industry and robber barons to run roughshod over theeconomy and workers by competing to see who can pay the lowest wages at the worstworking conditions? Or do we try to make the system work by setting up basic rules for themarket, instituting the first public schools, busting up monopolies, letting workers organizeinto unions? We chose to act, and we rose together. When the irrational exuberance of the Roaring Twenties came crashing down with the stockmarket, we had to decide: do we follow the call of leaders who would do nothing, or the call ofa leader who, perhaps because of his physical paralysis, refused to accept political paralysis? We chose to act -- regulating the market, putting people back to work, expanding bargainingrights to include health care and a secure retirement -- and together we rose. When World War II required the most massive home front mobilization in history and weneeded every single American to lend a hand, we had to decide: Do we listen to skeptics whotold us it wasn   t possible to produce that many tanks and planes? Or, did we build Roosevelt   sArsenal for Democracy and grow our economy even further by providing our returning heroeswith a chance to go to college and own their own home? Again, we chose to act, and again, we rose together. Today, at the beginning of this young century, we have to decide again. But this time, it isyour turn to choose. Here in Galesburg, you know what this new challenge is. You   ve seen it. All of you, your firstyear in college saw what happened at 9/11. It   s already been noted, the degree to which yourlives will be intertwined with the war on terrorism that currently is taking place. But whatyou   ve also seen, perhaps not as spectacularly, is the fact that when you drive by the oldMaytag plant around lunchtime, no one walks out anymore. I saw it during the campaign when I met union guys who worked at the plant for 20, 30 yearsand now wonder what they   re gonna do at the age of 55 without a pension or health care;when I met the man who   s son needed a new liver but because he   d been laid off, didn   t knowif he could afford to provide his child the care that he needed. It   s as if someone changed the rules in the middle of the game and no wonder -- no onebothered to tell these folks. And, in reality, the rules have changed. It started with technology and automation that rendered entire occupations obsolete. Whenwas the last time anybody here stood in line for the bank teller instead of going to the ATM, ortalked to a switchboard operator? Then it continued when companies like Maytag were able topick up and move their factories to some under developed country where workers were a lotcheaper than they are in the United States. As Tom Friedman points out in his new book, The World Is Flat, over the last decade or so,these forces -- technology and globalization -- have combined like never before. So that whilemost of us have been paying attention to how much easier technology has made our own lives-- sending e-mails back and forth on our blackberries, surfing the Web on our cell phones,instant messaging with friends across the world -- a quiet revolution has been breaking downbarriers and connecting the world   s economies. Now business not only has the ability to movejobs wherever there   s a factory, but wherever there   s an internet connection. Countries like India and China realized this. They understand that they no longer need to bejust a source of cheap labor or cheap exports. They can compete with us on a global scale.The one resource they needed were skilled, educated workers. So they started schooling theirkids earlier, longer, with a greater emphasis on math and science and technology, until theirmost talented students realized they don   t have to come to America to have a decent life --they can stay right where they are. The result? China is graduating four times the number of engineers that the United States isgraduating. Not only are those Maytag employees competing with Chinese and Indian andIndonesian and Mexican workers, you are too. Today, accounting firms are e-mailing your taxreturns to workers in India who will figure them out and send them back to you as fast as anyworker in Illinois or Indiana could. When you lose your luggage in Boston at an airport, tracking it down may involve a call to anagent in Bangalore, who will find it by making a phone call to Baltimore. Even the AssociatedPress has outsourced some of their jobs to writers all over the world who can send in a storyat a click of a mouse. As Prime Minister Tony Blair has said, in this new economy, ""Talent is the 21st centurywealth."" If you've got the skills, you've got the education, and you have the opportunity toupgrade and improve both, you   ll be able to compete and win anywhere. If not, the fall will befurther and harder than it ever was before. So what do we do about this? How does America find its way in this new, globaleconomy? What will our place in history be? Like so much of the American story, once again, we face a choice. Once again, there are thosewho believe that there isn   t much we can do about this as a nation. That the best idea is togive everyone one big refund on their government -- divvy it up by individual portions, in theform of tax breaks, hand it out, and encourage everyone to use their share to go buy theirown health care, their own retirement plan, their own child care, their own education, and soon. In Washington, they call this the Ownership Society. But in our past there has been anotherterm for it -- Social Darwinism -- every man or woman for him or herself. It   s a tempting idea,because it doesn   t require much thought or ingenuity. It allows us to say that those whosehealth care or tuition may rise faster than they can afford -- tough luck. It allows us to say tothe Maytag workers who have lost their job -- life isn   t fair. It let   s us say to the child who wasborn into poverty -- pull yourself up by your bootstraps. And it is especially tempting becauseeach of us believes we will always be the winner in life   s lottery, that we   re the one who will bethe next Donald Trump, or at least we won   t be the chump who Donald Trump says:    You   refired!    But there is a problem. It won   t work. It ignores our history. It ignores the fact that it   s beengovernment research and investment that made the railways possible and the internetpossible. It   s been the creation of a massive middle class, through decent wages and benefitsand public schools that allowed us all to prosper. Our economic dependence depended onindividual initiative. It depended on a belief in the free market; but it has also depended onour sense of mutual regard for each other, the idea that everybody has a stake in the country,that we   re all in it together and everybody   s got a shot at opportunity. That   s what   s producedour unrivaled political stability. And so if we do nothing in the face of globalization, more people will continue to lose theirhealth care. Fewer kids will be able to afford the diploma you   re about to receive. More companies like United Airlines won   t be able to provide pensions for their employees.And those Maytag workers will be joined in the unemployment line by any worker whose skillscan be bought and sold on the global market. So today I   m here to tell you what most of you already know. This is not us -- the option thatI just mentioned. Doing nothing. It   s not how our story ends -- not in this country. America isa land of big dreamers and big hopes. It is this hope that has sustained us through revolution and civil war, depression and worldwar, a struggle for civil and social rights and the brink of nuclear crisis. And it is because ourdreamers dreamed that we have emerged from each challenge more united, more prosperous,and more admired than before. So let   s dream. Instead of doing nothing or simply defending 20th century solutions, let   simagine together what we could do to give every American a fighting chance in the 21stcentury. What if we prepared every child in America with the education and skills they need to competein the new economy? If we made sure that college was affordable for everyone who wantedto go? If we walked up to those Maytag workers and we said    Your old job is not coming back,but a new job will be there because we   re going to seriously retrain you and there   s life-longeducation that   s waiting for you -- the sorts of opportunities that Knox has created with theStrong Futures scholarship program. What if no matter where you worked or how many times you switched jobs, you had healthcare and a pension that stayed with you always, so you all had the flexibility to move to abetter job or start a new business? What if instead of cutting budgets for research anddevelopment and science, we fueled the genius and the innovation that will lead to the newjobs and new industries of the future? Right now, all across America, there are amazing discoveries being made. If we supportedthese discoveries on a national level, if we committed ourselves to investing in thesepossibilities, just imagine what it could do for a town like Galesburg. Ten or twenty yearsdown the road, that old Maytag plant could re-open its doors as an Ethanol refinery thatturned corn into fuel. Down the street, a biotechnology research lab could open up on thecusp of discovering a cure for cancer. And across the way, a new auto company could be busychurning out electric cars. The new jobs created would be filled by American workers trainedwith new skills and a world-class education. All of that is possible but none of it will come easy. Every one of us is going to have to workmore, read more, train more, think more. We will have to slough off some bad habits -- likedriving gas guzzlers that weaken our economy and feed our enemies abroad. Our children willhave to turn off the TV set once in a while and put away the video games and start hitting thebooks. We   ll have to reform institutions, like our public schools, that were designed for anearlier time. Republicans will have to recognize our collective responsibilities, even asDemocrats recognize that we have to do more than just defend old programs. It won   t be easy, but it can be done. It can be our future. We have the talent and theresources and brainpower. But now we need the political will. We need a nationalcommitment. And we need each of you. Now, no one can force you to meet these challenges. If you want, it will be pretty easy for youto leave here today and not give another thought to towns like Galesburg and the challengesthey face. There is no community service requirement in the real world; no one is forcing youto care. You can take your diploma, walk off this stage, and go chasing after the big house, and thenice suits, and all the other things that our money culture says that you should want, that youshould aspire to, that you can buy. But I hope you don   t walk away from the challenge. Focusing your life solely on making a buckshows a certain poverty of ambition. It asks too little of yourself. You need to take up thechallenges that we face as a nation and make them your own. Not because you have a debt tothose who helped you get here, although you do have that debt. Not because you have anobligation to those who are less fortunate than you, although I do think you do have thatobligation. It   s primarily because you have an obligation to yourself. Because individualsalvation has always depended on collective salvation. Because it   s only when you hitch yourwagon to something larger than yourself that you realize your true potential. And I know that all of you are wondering how you   ll do this, the challenges seem so big. Theyseem so difficult for one person to make a difference. But we know it can be done. Because where you   re sitting, in this very place, in this town, it   shappened before. Nearly two centuries ago, before civil rights, before voting rights, before Abraham Lincoln,before the Civil War, before all of that, America was stained by the sin of slavery. In thesweltering heat of southern plantations, men and women who looked like me could not escapethe life of pain and servitude in which they were sold. And yet, year after year, as this moralcancer ate away at the American ideals of liberty and equality, the nation was silent. But its people didn   t stay silent for long. One by one, abolitionists emerged to tell their fellow Americans that this would not be ourplace in history -- that this was not the America that had captured the imagination of theworld. This resistance that they met was fierce, and some paid with their lives. But they would not bedeterred, and they soon spread out across the country to fight for their cause. One man fromNew York went west, all the way to the prairies of Illinois to start a colony. And here in Galesburg, freedom found a home. Here in Galesburg, the main depot for the Underground Railroad in Illinois, escaped slavescould roam freely on the streets and take shelter in people   s homes. And when their mastersor the police would come for them, the people of this town would help them escape north,some literally carrying them in their arms to freedom. Think about the risks that involved. If they were caught abetting a fugitive, you could   ve beenjailed or lynched. It would have been simple for these townspeople to turn the other way; togo live their lives in a private peace. And yet, they didn   t do that. Why? Because they knew that we were all Americans; that we were all brothers and sisters; thesame reason that a century later, young men and women your age would take Freedom Ridesdown south, to work for the Civil Rights movement. The same reason that black women wouldwalk instead of ride a bus after a long day of doing somebody else   s laundry and cleaningsomebody else   s kitchen. Because they were marching for freedom. Today, on this day of possibility, we stand in the shadow of a lanky, raw-boned man with littleformal education who once took the stage at Old Main and told the nation that if anyone didnot believe the American principles of freedom and equality, that those principles weretimeless and all-inclusive, they should go rip that page out of the Declaration ofIndependence. My hope for all of you is that as you leave here today, you decide to keep these principlesalive in your own life and in the life of this country. You will be tested. You won   t alwayssucceed. But know that you have it within your power to try. That generations who have comebefore you faced these same fears and uncertainties in their own time. And that through ourcollective labor, and through God   s providence, and our willingness to shoulder each other   sburdens, America will continue on its precious journey towards that distant horizon, and abetter day. Thank you so much class of 2005, and congratulations on your graduation. Thank you.",obama
"Thank you, Tim, for your hard work on this issue and on our economic recovery. The economic crisis we face is unlike any we've seen in our lifetime. It's a crisis of fallingconfidence and rising debt, of widely distributed risk and narrowly concentrated reward; acrisis written in the fine print of sub-prime mortgages, on the ledger lines of once mightyfinancial institutions, and on the pink slips that have upended the lives of so many peopleacross this country and cost the economy 2.6 million jobs last year alone.We know that even if we do everything that we should, this crisis was years in the making,and it will take more than weeks or months to turn things around.But make no mistake: A failure to act, and act now, will turn crisis into a catastrophe andguarantee a longer recession, a less robust recovery, and a more uncertain future. Millionsmore jobs will be lost. More businesses will be shuttered. More dreams will be deferred.And that's why I feel such a sense of urgency about the economic recovery and reinvestmentplan that is before Congress today. With it, we can save or create more than three millionjobs, doing things that will strengthen our country for years to come. It's not merely aprescription for short-term spending -- it's a strategy for long-term economic growth in areaslike renewable energy and health care and education.Now, in the past few days I've heard criticisms that this plan is somehow wanting, and thesecriticisms echo the very same failed economic theories that led us into this crisis in the firstplace -- the notion that tax cuts alone will solve all our problems; that we can ignorefundamental challenges like energy independence and the high cost of health care; that we can somehow deal with this in a piecemeal fashion and still expect our economy and ourcountry to thrive.I reject those theories. And so did the American people when they went to the polls inNovember and voted resoundingly for change. So I urge members of Congress to act withoutdelay. No plan is perfect, and we should work to make it stronger. No one is more committedto making it stronger than me. But let's not make the perfect the enemy of the essential. Let'sshow people all over the country who are looking for leadership in this difficult time that weare equal to the task.At the same time, we know that this recovery and reinvestment plan is only the first part ofwhat we need to do to restore prosperity and secure our future. We also need a strong andviable financial system to keep credit flowing to businesses and families alike. And myadministration will do whatever it takes to restore our financial system. Our recovery dependson it. And so in the next week, Secretary Geithner will release a new strategy to get creditmoving again -- a strategy that will reflect some of the lessons of past mistakes while layingthe foundation of the future.But in order to restore trust in our financial system, we're going to have to do more than justput forward our plans. In order to restore trust, we've got to make certain that taxpayer fundsare not subsidizing excessive compensation packages on Wall Street.We all need to take responsibility. And this includes executives at major financial firms whoturned to the American people, hat in hand, when they were in trouble, even as they paidthemselves customary lavish bonuses. As I said last week, this is the height of irresponsibility.It's shameful. And that's exactly the kind of disregard of the costs and consequences of theiractions that brought about this crisis: a culture of narrow self-interest and short-term gain atthe expense of everything else.This is America. We don't disparage wealth. We don't begrudge anybody for achievingsuccess. And we certainly believe that success should be rewarded. But what gets peopleupset -- and rightfully so -- are executives being rewarded for failure, especially when thoserewards are subsidized by U.S. taxpayers, many of whom are having a tough timethemselves.For top executives to award themselves these kinds of compensation packages in the midst ofthis economic crisis isn't just bad taste -- it's bad strategy -- and I will not tolerate it asPresident. We're going to be demanding some restraint in exchange for federal aid -- so thatwhen firms seek new federal dollars, we won't find them up to the same old tricks.As part of the reforms we're announcing today, top executives at firms receiving extraordinaryhelp from U.S. taxpayers will have their compensation capped at 500,000 dollars -- a fractionof the salaries that have been reported recently. And if these executives receive any additionalcompensation, it will come in the form of stock that can't be paid up until taxpayers are paidback for their assistance. Companies receiving federal aid are going to have to disclose publicly all the perks andluxuries bestowed upon senior executives, and provide an explanation to the taxpayers and toshareholders as to why these expenses are justified. And we're putting a stop to these kindsof massive severance packages we've all read about with disgust; we're taking the air out ofgolden parachutes.We're asking these firms to take responsibility, to recognize the nature of this crisis and theirrole in it. We believe that what we've laid out should be viewed as fair and embraced as basiccommon sense.And finally, these guidelines we're putting in place are only the beginning of a long-termeffort. We're going to examine the ways in which the means and manner of executivecompensation have contributed to a reckless culture and a quarter-by-quarter mentality thatin turn helped to wrought havoc in our financial system. We're going to be taking a look atbroader reforms so that executives are compensated for sound risk management, andrewarded for growth measured over years, not just days or weeks. We all have to pull together and take our share of responsibility. That's true here inWashington. That's true on Wall Street. The American people are carrying a huge burden as aresult of this economic crisis: bearing the brunt of its effects as well as the cost ofextraordinary measures we're taking to address them. The American people expect anddemand that we pursue policies that reflect the reality of this crisis -- and that will preventthese kinds of crises from occurring again in the future.Thank you very much.",obama
"Thank you so much. Thank you for this wonderful welcome. Thank you to the people of Prague. Thank youto the people of the Czech Republic. Today, I'm proud to stand here with you in the middle of this great city,in the center of Europe. And, to paraphrase one of my predecessors, I am also proud to be the man whobrought Michelle Obama to Prague.1 To Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, to all the dignitaries who are here, thank you for your extraordinaryhospitality. And to the people of the Czech Republic, thank you for your friendship to the United States. I've learned over many years to appreciate the good company and the good humor of the Czech people inmy hometown of Chicago. Behind me is a statue of a hero of the Czech people -- Tomas Masaryk. In 1918,after America had pledged its support for Czech independence, Masaryk spoke to a crowd in Chicago thatwas estimated to be over 100,000. I don't think I can match his record -- but I am honored to follow hisfootsteps from Chicago to Prague. For over a thousand years, Prague has set itself apart from any other city in any other place. You've knownwar and peace. You've seen empires rise and fall. You've led revolutions in the arts and science, in politicsand in poetry. Through it all, the people of Prague have insisted on pursuing their own path, and definingtheir own destiny. And this city -- this Golden City which is both ancient and youthful -- stands as a livingmonument to your unconquerable spirit. When I was born, the world was divided, and our nations were faced with very different circumstances. Fewpeople would have predicted that someone like me would one day become the President of the UnitedStates. Few people would have predicted that an American President would one day be permitted to speakto an audience like this in Prague. Few would have imagined that the Czech Republic would become a freenation, a member of NATO, a leader of a united Europe. Those ideas would have been dismissed asdreams. We are here today because enough people ignored the voices who told them that the world could notchange. We're here today because of the courage of those who stood up and took risks to say that freedom is a rightfor all people, no matter what side of a wall they live on, and no matter what they look like. We are here today because of the Prague Spring -- because the simple and principled pursuit of liberty andopportunity shamed those who relied on the power of tanks and arms to put down the will of a people. We are here today because 20 years ago, the people of this city took to the streets to claim the promise of anew day, and the fundamental human rights that had been denied them for far too long. Sametov   Revoluce-- the Velvet Revolution taught us many things. It showed us that peaceful protest could shake thefoundations of an empire, and expose the emptiness of an ideology. It showed us that small countries canplay a pivotal role in world events, and that young people can lead the way in overcoming old conflicts. Andit proved that moral leadership is more powerful than any weapon. That's why I'm speaking to you in the center of a Europe that is peaceful, united and free -- becauseordinary people believed that divisions could be bridged, even when their leaders did not. They believed thatwalls could come down; that peace could prevail. We are here today because Americans and Czechs believed against all odds that today could be possible. Now, we share this common history. But now this generation -- our generation -- cannot stand still. We, too,have a choice to make. As the world has become less divided, it has become more interconnected. Andwe've seen events move faster than our ability to control them -- a global economy in crisis, a changingclimate, the persistent dangers of old conflicts, new threats and the spread of catastrophic weapons. None of these challenges can be solved quickly or easily. But all of them demand that we listen to oneanother and work together; that we focus on our common interests, not on occasional differences; and thatwe reaffirm our shared values, which are stronger than any force that could drive us apart. That is the workthat we must carry on. That is the work that I have come to Europe to begin. To renew our prosperity, we need action coordinated across borders. That means investments to createnew jobs. That means resisting the walls of protectionism that stand in the way of growth. That means achange in our financial system, with new rules to prevent abuse and future crisis. And we have an obligation to our common prosperity and our common humanity to extend a hand to thoseemerging markets and impoverished people who are suffering the most, even though they may have hadvery little to do with financial crises, which is why we set aside over a trillion dollars for the InternationalMonetary Fund earlier this week, to make sure that everybody -- everybody -- receives some assistance. Now, to protect our planet, now is the time to change the way that we use energy. Together, we mustconfront climate change by ending the world's dependence on fossil fuels, by tapping the power of newsources of energy like the wind and sun, and calling upon all nations to do their part. And I pledge to youthat in this global effort, the United States is now ready to lead. To provide for our common security, we must strengthen our alliance. NATO was founded 60 years ago,after Communism took over Czechoslovakia. That was when the free world learned too late that it could notafford division. So we came together to forge the strongest alliance that the world has ever known. And weshould -- stood shoulder to shoulder -- year after year, decade after decade -- until an Iron Curtain waslifted, and freedom spread like flowing water. This marks the 10th year of NATO membership for the Czech Republic. And I know that many times in the20th century, decisions were made without you at the table. Great powers let you down, or determined yourdestiny without your voice being heard. I am here to say that the United States will never turn its back on thepeople of this nation. We are bound by shared values, shared history -- We are bound by shared values andshared history and the enduring promise of our alliance. NATO's Article V states it clearly: An attack on oneis an attack on all. That is a promise for our time, and for all time. The people of the Czech Republic kept that promise after America was attacked; thousands were killed onour soil, and NATO responded. NATO's mission in Afghanistan is fundamental to the safety of people onboth sides of the Atlantic. We are targeting the same al Qaeda terrorists who have struck from New York toLondon, and helping the Afghan people take responsibility for their future. We are demonstrating that freenations can make common cause on behalf of our common security. And I want you to know that we honorthe sacrifices of the Czech people in this endeavor, and mourn the loss of those you've lost. But no alliance can afford to stand still. We must work together as NATO members so that we havecontingency plans in place to deal with new threats, wherever they may come from. We must strengthen ourcooperation with one another, and with other nations and institutions around the world, to confront dangersthat recognize no borders. And we must pursue constructive relations with Russia on issues of commonconcern. Now, one of those issues that I'll focus on today is fundamental to the security of our nations and to thepeace of the world -- that's the future of nuclear weapons in the 21st century. The existence of thousands of nuclear weapons is the most dangerous legacy of the Cold War. No nuclearwar was fought between the United States and the Soviet Union, but generations lived with the knowledgethat their world could be erased in a single flash of light. Cities like Prague that existed for centuries, thatembodied the beauty and the talent of so much of humanity, would have ceased to exist. Today, the Cold War has disappeared but thousands of those weapons have not. In a strange turn ofhistory, the threat of global nuclear war has gone down, but the risk of a nuclear attack has gone up. Morenations have acquired these weapons. Testing has continued. Black market trade in nuclear secrets andnuclear materials abound. The technology to build a bomb has spread. Terrorists are determined to buy,build or steal one. Our efforts to contain these dangers are centered on a global non-proliferation regime,but as more people and nations break the rules, we could reach the point where the center cannot hold. Now, understand, this matters to people everywhere. One nuclear weapon exploded in one city -- be it NewYork or Moscow, Islamabad or Mumbai, Tokyo or Tel Aviv, Paris or Prague -- could kill hundreds ofthousands of people. And no matter where it happens, there is no end to what the consequences might be --for our global safety, our security, our society, our economy, to our ultimate survival. Some argue that the spread of these weapons cannot be stopped, cannot be checked -- that we aredestined to live in a world where more nations and more people possess the ultimate tools of destruction.Such fatalism is a deadly adversary, for if we believe that the spread of nuclear weapons is inevitable, thenin some way we are admitting to ourselves that the use of nuclear weapons is inevitable. Just as we stood for freedom in the 20th century, we must stand together for the right of people everywhereto live free from fear in the 21st century. And as nuclear power -- as a nuclear power, as the only nuclearpower to have used a nuclear weapon, the United States has a moral responsibility to act. We cannotsucceed in this endeavor alone, but we can lead it, we can start it. So today, I state clearly and with conviction America's commitment to seek the peace and security of aworld without nuclear weapons. I'm not naive. This goal will not be reached quickly -- perhaps not in mylifetime. It will take patience and persistence. But now we, too, must ignore the voices who tell us that theworld cannot change. We have to insist, ""Yes, we can."" Now, let me describe to you the trajectory we need to be on. First, the United States will take concrete stepstowards a world without nuclear weapons. To put an end to Cold War thinking, we will reduce the role ofnuclear weapons in our national security strategy, and urge others to do the same. Make no mistake: Aslong as these weapons exist, the United States will maintain a safe, secure and effective arsenal to deterany adversary, and guarantee that defense to our allies -- including the Czech Republic. But we will beginthe work of reducing our arsenal. To reduce our warheads and stockpiles, we will negotiate a new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with theRussians this year. President Medvedev and I began this process in London, and will seek a newagreement by the end of this year that is legally binding and sufficiently bold. And this will set the stage forfurther cuts, and we will seek to include all nuclear weapons states in this endeavor. To achieve a global ban on nuclear testing, my administration will immediately and aggressively pursue U.S.ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. After more than five decades of talks, it is time for thetesting of nuclear weapons to finally be banned. And to cut off the building blocks needed for a bomb, the United States will seek a new treaty that verifiablyends the production of fissile materials intended for use in state nuclear weapons. If we are serious aboutstopping the spread of these weapons, then we should put an end to the dedicated production of weapons- grade materials that create them. That's the first step. Second, together we will strengthen the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as a basis for cooperation. The basic bargain is sound: Countries with nuclear weapons will move towards disarmament, countrieswithout nuclear weapons will not acquire them, and all countries can access peaceful nuclear energy. Tostrengthen the treaty, we should embrace several principles. We need more resources and authority tostrengthen international inspections. We need real and immediate consequences for countries caughtbreaking the rules or trying to leave the treaty without cause. And we should build a new framework for civil nuclear cooperation, including an international fuel bank, sothat countries can access peaceful power without increasing the risks of proliferation. That must be the rightof every nation that renounces nuclear weapons, especially developing countries embarking on peacefulprograms. And no approach will succeed if it's based on the denial of rights to nations that play by the rules.We must harness the power of nuclear energy on behalf of our efforts to combat climate change, and toadvance peace opportunity for all people. But we go forward with no illusions. Some countries will break the rules. That's why we need a structure inplace that ensures when any nation does, they will face consequences. Just this morning, we were reminded again of why we need a new and more rigorous approach to addressthis threat. North Korea broke the rules once again by testing a rocket that could be used for long rangemissiles. This provocation underscores the need for action -- not just this afternoon at the U.N. SecurityCouncil, but in our determination to prevent the spread of these weapons. Rules must be binding. Violations must be punished. Words must mean something. The world must standtogether to prevent the spread of these weapons. Now is the time for a strong international response -- nowis the time for a strong international response, and North Korea must know that the path to security andrespect will never come through threats and illegal weapons. All nations must come together to build astronger, global regime. And that's why we must stand shoulder to shoulder to pressure the North Koreansto change course. Iran has yet to build a nuclear weapon. My administration will seek engagement with Iran based on mutualinterests and mutual respect. We believe in dialogue. But in that dialogue we will present a clear choice. Wewant Iran to take its rightful place in the community of nations, politically and economically. We will supportIran's right to peaceful nuclear energy with rigorous inspections. That's a path that the Islamic Republic cantake. Or the government can choose increased isolation, international pressure, and a potential nucleararms race in the region that will increase insecurity for all. So let me be clear: Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile activity poses a real threat, not just to the UnitedStates, but to Iran's neighbors and our allies. The Czech Republic and Poland have been courageous inagreeing to host a defense against these missiles. As long as the threat from Iran persists, we will goforward with a missile defense system that is cost-effective and proven. If the Iranian threat is eliminated, wewill have a stronger basis for security, and the driving force for missile defense construction in Europe willbe removed. So, finally, we must ensure that terrorists never acquire a nuclear weapon. This is the most immediate andextreme threat to global security. One terrorist with one nuclear weapon could unleash massive destruction.Al Qaeda has said it seeks a bomb and that it would have no problem with using it. And we know that thereis unsecured nuclear material across the globe. To protect our people, we must act with a sense of purposewithout delay. So today I am announcing a new international effort to secure all vulnerable nuclear material around theworld within four years. We will set new standards, expand our cooperation with Russia, pursue newpartnerships to lock down these sensitive materials. We must also build on our efforts to break up black markets, detect and intercept materials in transit, anduse financial tools to disrupt this dangerous trade. Because this threat will be lasting, we should cometogether to turn efforts such as the Proliferation Security Initiative and the Global Initiative to CombatNuclear Terrorism into durable international institutions. And we should start by having a Global Summit onNuclear Security that the United States will host within the next year. Now, I know that there are some who will question whether we can act on such a broad agenda. There arethose who doubt whether true international cooperation is possible, given inevitable differences amongnations. And there are those who hear talk of a world without nuclear weapons and doubt whether it's worthsetting a goal that seems impossible to achieve. But make no mistake: We know where that road leads. When nations and peoples allow themselves to bedefined by their differences, the gulf between them widens. When we fail to pursue peace, then it staysforever beyond our grasp. We know the path when we choose fear over hope. To denounce or shrug off acall for cooperation is an easy but also a cowardly thing to do. That's how wars begin. That's where humanprogress ends. There is violence and injustice in our world that must be confronted. We must confront it not by splittingapart but by standing together as free nations, as free people. I know that a call to arms can stir the souls ofmen and women more than a call to lay them down. But that is why the voices for peace and progress mustbe raised together. Those are the voices that still echo through the streets of Prague. Those are the ghosts of 1968. Thosewere the joyful sounds of the Velvet Revolution. Those were the Czechs who helped bring down a nuclear- armed empire without firing a shot. Human destiny will be what we make of it. And here in Prague, let us honor our past by reaching for a betterfuture. Let us bridge our divisions, build upon our hopes, accept our responsibility to leave this world moreprosperous and more peaceful than we found it. Together we can do it. Thank you very much. Thank you, Prague. 1 Reference to President John F. Kennedy's remark -- upon observing the overwhelmingly positive reception given his wife upon their first visit to France --as ""the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris.""",obama
"Mr. Speaker, Madam Deputy Speaker, distinguished members, I am honored to speak in this chamber, andI am committed to renewing the alliance between our nations and the friendship between our people. This is my first trip overseas as President of the United States. I've been to the G20 summit in London, andthe NATO summit in Strasbourg, and the European Union summit in Prague. Some people have asked meif I chose to continue my travels to Ankara and Istanbul to send a message to the world. And my answer issimple: Evet -- yes. Turkey is a critical ally. Turkey is an important part of Europe. And Turkey and theUnited States must stand together -- and work together -- to overcome the challenges of our time. This morning I had the great privilege of visiting the tomb of your extraordinary founder of your republic. AndI was deeply impressed by this beautiful memorial to a man who did so much to shape the course of history.But it is also clear that the greatest monument to Ataturk's life is not something that can be cast in stone andmarble. His greatest legacy is Turkey's strong, vibrant, secular democracy, and that is the work that thisassembly carries on today. This future was not easily assured, it was not guaranteed. At the end of World War I, Turkey could havesuccumbed to the foreign powers that were trying to claim its territory, or sought to restore an ancientempire. But Turkey chose a different future. You freed yourself from foreign control, and you founded arepublic that commands the respect of the United States and the wider world. And there is a simple truth to this story: Turkey's democracy is your own achievement. It was not forcedupon you by any outside power, nor did it come without struggle and sacrifice. Turkey draws strength fromboth the successes of the past, and from the efforts of each generation of Turks that makes new progressfor your people. Now, my country's democracy has its own story. The general who led America in revolution and governedas our first President was, as many of you know, George Washington. And like you, we built a grandmonument to honor our founding father -- a towering obelisk that stands in the heart of the capital city thatbears Washington's name. I can see the Washington Monument from the window of the White House everyday. It took decades to build. There were frequent delays. Over time, more and more people contributed to helpmake this monument the inspiring structure that still stands tall today. Among those who came to our aidwere friends from all across the world who offered their own tributes to Washington and the country hehelped to found. And one of those tributes came from Istanbul. Ottoman Sultan Abdulmecid sent a marble plaque that helpedto build the Washington Monument. Inscribed in the plaque was a poem that began with a few simple words:""So as to strengthen the friendship between the two countries."" Over 150 years have passed since thosewords were carved into marble. Our nations have changed in many ways. But our friendship is strong, andour alliance endures. It is a friendship that flourished in the years after World War II, when President Truman committed ournation to the defense of Turkey's freedom and sovereignty, and Turkey committed itself into the NATOAlliance. Turkish troops have served by our side from Korea to Kosovo to Kabul. Together, we withstood thegreat test of the Cold War. Trade between our nations has steadily advanced. So has cooperation inscience and research. The ties among our people have deepened, as well, and more and more Americans of Turkish origin liveand work and succeed within our borders. And as a basketball fan, I've even noticed that Hedo Turkogluand Mehmet Okur have got some pretty good basketball games. The United States and Turkey have not always agreed on every issue, and that's to be expected -- no twonations do. But we have stood together through many challenges over the last 60 years. And because of thestrength of our alliance and the endurance of our friendship, both America and Turkey are stronger and theworld is more secure. Now, our two democracies are confronted by an unprecedented set of challenges: An economic crisis thatrecognizes no borders; extremism that leads to the killing of innocent men and women and children; strainson our energy supply and a changing climate; the proliferation of the world's deadliest weapons; and thepersistence of tragic conflict. These are the great tests of our young century. And the choices that we make in the coming years willdetermine whether the future will be shaped by fear or by freedom; by poverty or by prosperity; by strife orby a just, secure and lasting peace. This much is certain: No one nation can confront these challenges alone, and all nations have a stake inovercoming them. That is why we must listen to one another, and seek common ground. That is why wemust build on our mutual interests, and rise above our differences. We are stronger when we act together. That is the message that I've carried with me throughout this trip to Europe. That is the message that Idelivered when I had the privilege of meeting with your President and with your Prime Minister. That will bethe approach of the United States of America going forward. Already, America and Turkey are working with the G20 on an unprecedented response to an unprecedentedeconomic crisis. Now, this past week, we came together to ensure that the world's largest economies takestrong and coordinated action to stimulate growth and restore the flow of credit; to reject the pressures ofprotectionism, and to extend a hand to developing countries and the people hit hardest by this downturn;and to dramatically reform our regulatory system so that the world never faces a crisis like this again. As we go forward, the United States and Turkey can pursue many opportunities to serve prosperity for ourpeople. The President and I this morning talked about expanding the ties of commerce and trade. There'senormous opportunity when it comes to energy to create jobs. And we can increase new sources to not onlyfree ourselves from dependence of other energies -- other countries' energy sources, but also to combatclimate change. We should build on our Clean Technology Fund to leverage efficiency and renewableenergy investments in Turkey. And to power markets in Turkey and Europe, the United States will continueto support your central role as an East-West corridor for oil and natural gas. This economic cooperation only reinforces the common security that Europe and the United States sharewith Turkey as a NATO ally, and the common values that we share as democracies. So in meeting thechallenges of the 21st century, we must seek the strength of a Europe that is truly united, peaceful and free. So let me be clear: The United States strongly supports Turkey's bid to become a member of the EuropeanUnion. We speak not as members of the EU, but as close friends of both Turkey and Europe. Turkey hasbeen a resolute ally and a responsible partner in transatlantic and European institutions. Turkey is bound toEurope by more than the bridges over the Bosphorous. Centuries of shared history, culture, and commercebring you together. Europe gains by the diversity of ethnicity, tradition and faith -- it is not diminished by it.And Turkish membership would broaden and strengthen Europe's foundation once more. Now, of course, Turkey has its own responsibilities. And you've made important progress towardsmembership. But I also know that Turkey has pursued difficult political reforms not simply because it's goodfor EU membership, but because it's right for Turkey. In the last several years, you've abolished state security courts, you've expanded the right to counsel.You've reformed the penal code and strengthened laws that govern the freedom of the press and assembly.You've lifted bans on teaching and broadcasting Kurdish, and the world noted with respect the importantsignal sent through a new state Kurdish television station. These achievements have created new laws that must be implemented, and a momentum that should besustained. For democracies cannot be static -- they must move forward. Freedom of religion and expressionlead to a strong and vibrant civil society that only strengthens the state, which is why steps like reopeningHalki Seminary will send such an important signal inside Turkey and beyond. An enduring commitment tothe rule of law is the only way to achieve the security that comes from justice for all people. Robust minorityrights let societies benefit from the full measure of contributions from all citizens. I say this as the President of a country that not very long ago made it hard for somebody who looks like meto vote, much less be President of the United States. But it is precisely that capacity to change that enrichesour countries. Every challenge that we face is more easily met if we tend to our own democratic foundation.This work is never over. That's why, in the United States, we recently ordered the prison at GuantanamoBay closed. That's why we prohibited -- without exception or equivocation -- the use of torture. All of us haveto change. And sometimes change is hard. Another issue that confronts all democracies as they move to the future is how we deal with the past. TheUnited States is still working through some of our own darker periods in our history. Facing the WashingtonMonument that I spoke of is a memorial of Abraham Lincoln, the man who freed those who were enslavedeven after Washington led our Revolution. Our country still struggles with the legacies of slavery andsegregation, the past treatment of Native Americans. Human endeavor is by its nature imperfect. History is often tragic, but unresolved, it can be a heavy weight.Each country must work through its past. And reckoning with the past can help us seize a better future. Iknow there's strong views in this chamber about the terrible events of 1915. And while there's been a gooddeal of commentary about my views, it's really about how the Turkish and Armenian people deal with thepast. And the best way forward for the Turkish and Armenian people is a process that works through thepast in a way that is honest, open and constructive. We've already seen historic and courageous steps taken by Turkish and Armenian leaders. These contactshold out the promise of a new day. An open border would return the Turkish and Armenian people to apeaceful and prosperous coexistence that would serve both of your nations. So I want you to know that theUnited States strongly supports the full normalization of relations between Turkey and Armenia. It is a causeworth working towards. It speaks to Turkey's leadership that you are poised to be the only country in the region to have normal andpeaceful relations with all the South Caucasus nations. And to advance that peace, you can play aconstructive role in helping to resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, which has continued for far too long. Advancing peace also includes the disputes that persist in the Eastern Mediterranean. And here there's acause for hope. The two Cypriot leaders have an opportunity through their commitment to negotiationsunder the United Nations Good Offices Mission. The United States is willing to offer all the help sought bythe parties as they work towards a just and lasting settlement that reunifies Cyprus into a bizonal andbicommunal federation. These efforts speak to one part of the critical region that surrounds Turkey. And when we consider thechallenges before us, on issue after issue, we share common goals. In the Middle East, we share the goalof a lasting peace between Israel and its neighbors. Let me be clear: The United States strongly supportsthe goal of two states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security. That is a goal sharedby Palestinians, Israelis, and people of goodwill around the world. That is a goal that the parties agreed to inthe road map and at Annapolis. That is a goal that I will actively pursue as President of the United States. We know the road ahead will be difficult. Both Israelis and Palestinians must take steps that are necessaryto build confidence and trust. Both Israelis and Palestinians, both must live up to the commitments they have made. Both must overcomelongstanding passions and the politics of the moment to make progress towards a secure and lasting peace. The United States and Turkey can help the Palestinians and Israelis make this journey. Like the UnitedStates, Turkey has been a friend and partner in Israel's quest for security. And like the United States, youseek a future of opportunity and statehood for the Palestinians. So now, working together, we must not giveinto pessimism and mistrust. We must pursue every opportunity for progress, as you've done by supportingnegotiations between Syria and Israel. We must extend a hand to those Palestinians who are in need, whilehelping them strengthen their own institutions. We must reject the use of terror, and recognize that Israel'ssecurity concerns are legitimate. The peace of the region will also be advanced if Iran forgoes any nuclear weapons ambitions. Now, as Imade clear in Prague yesterday, no one is served by the spread of nuclear weapons, least of all Turkey.You live in a difficult region and a nuclear arm race would not serve the security of this nation well. This partof the world has known enough violence. It has known enough hatred. It does not need a race for an ever- more powerful tool of destruction. Now, I have made it clear to the people and leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran that the United Statesseeks engagement based on mutual interest and mutual respect. We want Iran to play its rightful role in thecommunity of nations. Iran is a great civilization. We want them to engage in the economic and politicalintegration that brings prosperity and security. But Iran's leaders must choose whether they will try to build aweapon or build a better future for their people. So both Turkey and the United States support a secure and united Iraq that does not serve as a safe havenfor terrorists. I know there were differences about whether to go to war. There were differences within myown country, as well. But now we must come together as we end this war responsibly, because the future ofIraq is inseparable from the future of the broader region. As I've already announced, and many of you areaware, the United States will remove our combat brigades by the end of next August, while working with theIraqi government as they take responsibility for security. And we will work with Iraq, Turkey, and all Iraq'sneighbors, to forge a new dialogue that reconciles differences and advances our common security. Make no mistake, though: Iraq, Turkey, and the United States face a common threat from terrorism. Thatincludes the al Qaeda terrorists who have sought to drive Iraqis apart and destroy their country. Thatincludes the PKK. There is no excuse for terror against any nation. As President, and as a NATO ally, Ipledge that you will have our support against the terrorist activities of the PKK or anyone else. These effortswill be strengthened by the continued work to build ties of cooperation between Turkey, the Iraqigovernment, and Iraq's Kurdish leaders, and by your continued efforts to promote education and opportunityand democracy for the Kurdish population here inside Turkey. Finally, we share the common goal of denying al Qaeda a safe haven in Pakistan or Afghanistan. The worldhas come too far to let this region backslide, and to let al Qaeda terrorists plot further attacks. That's why weare committed to a more focused effort to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda. That is why we areincreasing our efforts to train Afghans to sustain their own security, and to reconcile former adversaries.That's why we are increasing our support for the people of Afghanistan and Pakistan, so that we stand onthe side not only of security, but also of opportunity and the promise of a better life. Turkey has been a true partner. Your troops were among the first in the International Security AssistanceForce. You have sacrificed much in this endeavor. Now we must achieve our goals together. I appreciatethat you've offered to help us train and support Afghan security forces, and expand opportunity across theregion. Together, we can rise to meet this challenge like we have so many before. I know there have been difficulties these last few years. I know that the trust that binds the United Statesand Turkey has been strained, and I know that strain is shared in many places where the Muslim faith ispracticed. So let me say this as clearly as I can: The United States is not, and will never be, at war withIslam. In fact, our partnership with the Muslim world is critical not just in rolling back the violent ideologiesthat people of all faiths reject, but also to strengthen opportunity for all its people. I also want to be clear that America's relationship with the Muslim community, the Muslim world, cannot, andwill not, just be based upon opposition to terrorism. We seek broader engagement based on mutual interestand mutual respect. We will listen carefully, we will bridge misunderstandings, and we will seek commonground. We will be respectful, even when we do not agree. We will convey our deep appreciation for theIslamic faith, which has done so much over the centuries to shape the world -- including in my own country.The United States has been enriched by Muslim Americans. Many other Americans have Muslims in theirfamilies or have lived in a Muslim-majority country. I know, because I am one of them. Above all, above all we will demonstrate through actions our commitment to a better future. I want to helpmore children get the education that they need to succeed. We want to promote health care in places wherepeople are vulnerable. We want to expand the trade and investment that can bring prosperity for all people.In the months ahead, I will present specific programs to advance these goals. Our focus will be on what wecan do, in partnership with people across the Muslim world, to advance our common hopes and ourcommon dreams. And when people look back on this time, let it be said of America that we extended thehand of friendship to all people. There's an old Turkish proverb: ""You cannot put out fire with flames."" America knows this. Turkey knowsthis. There's some who must be met by force, they will not compromise. But force alone cannot solve ourproblems, and it is no alternative to extremism. The future must belong to those who create, not those whodestroy. That is the future we must work for, and we must work for it together. I know there are those who like to debate Turkey's future. They see your country at the crossroads ofcontinents, and touched by the currents of history. They know that this has been a place where civilizationsmeet, and different peoples come together. They wonder whether you will be pulled in one direction oranother. But I believe here is what they don't understand: Turkey's greatness lies in your ability to be at the center ofthings. This is not where East and West divide -- this is where they come together. In the beauty of yourculture. In the richness of your history. In the strength of your democracy. In your hopes for tomorrow. I amhonored to stand here with you -- to look forward to the future that we must reach for together -- and toreaffirm America's commitment to our strong and enduring friendship. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.",obama
"Thank you very much, Mr. President. You know, four years ago, following the most devastating attack in our history, this Bodypassed the USA PATRIOT Act in order to give our Nation's law enforcement the tools theyneeded to track down terrorists who plot and lurk within our own borders and all over theworld; terrorists who, right now, are looking to exploit weaknesses in our laws and oursecurity to carry out attacks that may be even deadlier than those that took place onSeptember 11th. We all agree that we need legislation to make it harder for suspected terrorists to goundetected in this country. And we all agree that we needed to make it harder for them toorganize and strategize and get flight licenses and sneak across our borders. Americanseverywhere wanted to do that. But soon after the PATRIOT Act passed, a few years before I even arrived here in the Senate,I began hearing concerns from people of every background and political leaning that this law,the very purpose of which was to protect us, was also threatening to violate some of therights and freedoms that we hold most dear; that it didn't just provide law enforcement thepowers it needed to keep us safe but powers that it didn't need to invade our privacy withoutcause or suspicion. Now, in Washington, this issue has tended to degenerate into the typical either/or debate:Either we protect our people from terror or we protect our most cherished principles. I wouldsuggest, Mr. President, that this is a false choice. It asks too little of us and it assumes toolittle about America. That's why, as it's come to time to reauthorize the USA PATRIOT Act, we've been working in abipartisan way to do both -- to show American people that we can track down terroristswithout trampling on our civil liberties, to show the American people that the FederalGovernment will only issue warrants and execute searches because it needs to do so, notbecause it can do so. What we have been trying to achieve under the leadership of a bipartisan group of Senators issome accountability in this process to get answers and see evidence where there is suspicion. Several weeks ago, these efforts bore fruit. The Judiciary Committee and the U.S. -- U.S.Senate managed to pass a piece of bipartisan legislation that, while I can't say is perfect, wasable to address some of the most serious problems in the existing law. Unfortunately, that strong bipartisan legislation has been tossed aside in conference. Instead,we've been forced to consider a piece of rushed legislation that fails to address the concernsof Members of both parties as well as the American people. This is legislation that puts our own Justice Department above the law. When national securityletters are issued, they allow Federal agents to conduct any search on any American, nomatter how extensive, how wide ranging, without ever going before a judge to prove that thesearch is necessary. All that is needed is a signoff from a local FBI agent. That's it. Once a business or a person receives notification that they will be searched, they areprohibited from telling anyone about it and they're even prohibited from challenging thisautomatic gag order in court. Even though judges have already found that similar restrictionsviolate the first amendment, this conference report disregards the case law and the right tochallenge the gag order. If you do decide to consult an attorney for legal advice, hold on. You will have to tell the FBIthat you've done so. Think about that: You want to talk to a lawyer about whether or not youractions are going to be causing you to get into trouble, you've got to tell the FBI that you'reconsulting a lawyer. This is unheard of. There is no such requirement in any other area of thelaw. I see no reason why it's justified here. And if someone wants to know why their own Government has decided to go on a fishingexpedition through every personal record or private document, through the library books thatyou read, the phone calls that you've made, the e-mails that you've sent, this legislation givespeople no rights to appeal the need for such a search in a court of law. No judge will hear your plea; no jury will hear your case. This is just plain wrong. And thereare Republican Senators as well as Democratic Senators that recognize that it's plain wrong. Giving law enforcement the tools they need to investigate suspicious activities is one thingand it's the right thing; but doing it without any real oversight seriously jeopardizes the rightsof all Americans and the ideals America stands for. Now, supporters of this conference report have argued we should just hold our noses andsupport this legislation because it's not going to get any better. That is not a good argument.We can do better. We've got time to do better. It doesn't convince me that I should supportthis report. I believe we owe it to the Nation, we owe it to those who fought for our civilliberties, we owe it to the future and our children to make sure that we craft the kind oflegislation that would make us proud, not just legislation that we would settle for becausewe're in a rush. We don't have to settle for a PATRIOT Act that sacrifices our liberties or oursafety. We can have one that secures both. Now, there have been proposals on both sides of the aisle and in both Houses of Congress toextend the PATRIOT Act for three months so that we can reach an agreement on this bill thatis well thought through. I support these efforts and will oppose cloture on what I consider tobe this unacceptable conference report. Mr. President, I thank you. I yield the floor....",obama
"Thank you. Thank you, guys. Let me say Multinational Force Iraq, Multinational Corps Iraq,Multinational Security Transition Command Iraq First Corps, America's Corp Band: Thanks toall of you. Listen, I am so honored. Audience Member: We love you. President Obama: I love you back. I am honored -- I'm honored and grateful to be with all ofyou. And I'm not going to talk long because I want to shake as many hands as I can. And I'vebeen talking all week. But there's a couple of things I want to say. Number one, thank you. You know, when I was at Camp Lejeune I spoke about what it means for America to see ourbest and brightest, our finest young men and women serve us. And what I said then issomething that I want to repeat to you, which is: You have performed brilliantly in everymission that has been given to you. Under enormous strain and under enormous sacrifice, through controversy and difficulty andpolitics, you've kept your eyes focused on just doing your job. And because of that, everymission that's been assigned -- from getting rid of Saddam, to reducing violence, to stabilizingthe country, to facilitating elections -- you have given Iraq the opportunity to stand on its ownas a democratic country. That is an extraordinary achievement, and for that you have thethanks of the American people. That's point number one. Point number two is, this is going to be a critical period, these next 18 months. I was justdiscussing this with your commander, but I think it's something that all of you know. It istime for us to transition to the Iraqis. They need to take responsibility for their country and fortheir sovereignty. And in order for them to do that, they have got to make political accommodations. They'regoing to have to decide that they want to resolve their differences through constitutionalmeans and legal means. They are going to have to focus on providing government servicesthat encourage confidence among their citizens. All those things they have to do. We can't do it for them. But what we can do is make surethat we are a stalwart partner, that we are working alongside them, that we are committed totheir success, that in terms of training their security forces, training their civilian forces inorder to achieve a more effective government, they know that they have a steady partnerwith us. And so just as we thank you for what you've already accomplished, I want to say thank youbecause you will be critical in terms of us being able to make sure that Iraq is stable, that it isnot a safe haven for terrorists, that it is a good neighbor and a good ally, and we can startbringing our folks home. So now is not the time to lose focus. We have to be even morefocused than we've been in order to achieve success. The last point I want to make is I know how hard it's been on a lot of you. You've been awayfrom your families, many of you for multiple rotations. You've seen buddies of yours injuredand you remember those who have made the ultimate sacrifice. There are probably some people here who have seen children born and have been missingwatching them grow up. There are many of you who have listened to your spouse and theextraordinary sacrifices that they have to make when you're gone. And so I want you to know that Michelle and myself are doing everything -- are doingeverything we can to provide additional support for military families. The federal budget that Ihave introduced increases support for military families. We are going to do everythingrequired to make sure that the commitment we make to our veterans is met, and that peopledon't have to fight for what they have earned as a consequence of their service. The main point I want to make is we have not forgotten what you have already done, we aregrateful for what you will do, and as long as I am in the White House, you are going to get thesupport that you need and the thanks that you deserve from a grateful nation. So thank you very much everybody. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.",obama
"Thank you for the extraordinary welcome. And thanks for those of you who prepared, from the CIA gift shop, the t-shirts, the caps, the water bottles. Michelle and the girls willappreciate that very much. It is a great honor to be here with the men and women of the CIA. I   ve been eager to come out here to Langley for some time so I can deliver a simple message to you in person on behalf of the American people: Thank you. Thank you for all the work that you do to protectthe American people and the freedom that we all cherish. The CIA is fundamental to America   s national security. And I want you to know that that   s why I nominated such an outstanding public servant and close friend, Leon Panetta, to lead -- to lead the agency. He is one of our nation   s finest public servants. He has my complete confidence. And he is a strong voice in my national security team, as well as a strongadvocate for the men and women of the CIA. I also benefit from the counsel of several agency veterans -- chief among them, SteveKappes, who   s stayed on to serve as Leon   s deputy. He   s -- and he   s done outstanding work. I have to add, just as an aside, by the way, I just met with a smaller group of about 50, so we could have a dialogue. And all of you look really young. And so to have a graybeard literallyand figuratively like Steve Kappes here, I think, is absolutely critical. I also want you to know that we have one of your own, John Brennan, who is doing a terrific job as my adviser for counterterrorism and homeland security. And we are very grateful for the work that he does and the insights that he brings, from his long years of service here atthe CIA. And I would be remiss if I didn   t mention the extraordinary former CIA officer and Director of Central Intelligence, Bob Gates, who is also part of our Cabinet and every once in a whilegives me a few tips. So let me share with you just a few thoughts about the situation in which we find ourselves. First, I want to underscore the importance of the CIA. When the CIA was founded, you were focused on one overarching threat, the Soviet Union. And for decades, the CIA carried out a critically important mission. And with the end of the Cold War, some wondered how importantthe CIA would be to our future. Now we know. Here in the 21st century, we   ve learned that the CIA is more important than ever. For as Leon mentioned, we face a wide range of unconventional challenges: stateless terrorist networks like al-Qaeda, the spread of catastrophic weapons, cyberthreats, failed states, rogue regimes,persistent conflict. And now we have to add to our list piracy. The CIA is unique in the capabilities of collection, analysis and operation that you bring to bear. So you are an indispensable tool, the tip of the spear in America   s intelligence missionand our national security. It is because of you that I can make good decisions. You prove that the key to good intelligence is not simply technology. It   s the quality of the men and women who have signedup to serve. You   re on the front lines against unconventional challenges. You help us understand the world as it is. You support the work of our troops and our diplomats and law enforcement officers. You disrupt terrorist plots, and you   re critical to our efforts to destroy terrorist networks. You serve capably, courageously, and from here inVirginia to dangerous outposts around the globe, you make enormous sacrifices on our behalf. So you should be proud of what you do. Second, you need to know that you   ve got my full support. For decades, the American people have counted on you to protect them. I know that I   ve come to personally count on your services. I rely on your reporting and your analysis, which finds its way onto my desk everysingle day. And I know you   ve got a tough job. I know there   s no margin for error. And I know there are endless demands for intelligence. There is an urgent necessity to collect and analyzeinformation and to work seamlessly with other agencies to act on it. And -- And what makes it tougher is when you succeed, as you so often do, that success usually has to stay secret. So you don   t get credit when things go good, but you sure getsome blame when things don   t. Audience Member: [Words indistinct.] President Obama: Now -- I got an amen corner out there. Now, in that context, I know that the last few days have been difficult. As I made clear, in releasing the OLC memos as a consequence of a court case that was pending and to which it was very difficult for us to mount an effective legal defense, I acted primarily because of the exceptional circumstances that surrounded these memos, particularly the fact that so much of the information was public -- had been publicly acknowledged. Thecovert nature of the information had been compromised. I have fought to protect the integrity of classified information in the past, and I will do so in the future. And there is nothing more important than protecting the identities of CIA officers. So I need everybody to be clear: we will protect your identities and your security as you vigorously pursue your missions. I will be as vigorous in protecting you as you are vigorous inprotecting the American people. Now, I have put an end to the interrogation techniques described in those OLC memos. And I want to -- I want to be very clear and very blunt. I   ve done so for a simple reason: because I believe that our nation is stronger and more secure when we deploy the full measure of both our power and the power of our values, including the rule of law. I know I can count on you todo exactly that. You know, there have been some conversations that I   ve had with senior folks here at Langley in which I think people have expressed understandable anxiety and concern. So I -- I -- I want to make a point that I just made in the smaller group. I understand that it   s hard when you are asked to protect the American people against people who have no scruples and wouldwillingly and gladly kill innocents. Al-Qaeda   s not constrained by a constitution. Many of our adversaries are not constrained by a belief in freedom of speech or representation in court or rule of law. So I   m sure that sometimes it seems as if that means we   re operating with one hand tied behind our back or that those who would argue for a higher standard are naive. I understand that. You know, I   ve-- I watch the cable shows once in a while. What makes the United States special, and what makes you special, is precisely the fact that we are willing to uphold our values and ideals even when it   s hard -- not just when it   s easy; even when we are afraid and under threat -- not just when it   s expedient to do so. That   s whatmakes us different. So yes, you   ve got a harder job. And so do I. And that   s okay, because that   s why we can take such extraordinary pride in being Americans. And over the long term, that is why I believe wewill defeat our enemies: because we   re on the better side of history. So don   t be discouraged by what   s happened in the last few weeks. Don   t be discouraged that we have to acknowledge potentially we   ve made some mistakes. That   s how we learn. But the fact that we are willing to acknowledge them and then move forward, that is precisely why I am proud to be President of the United States, and that   s why you should be proud tobe members of the CIA. All right? Third point -- Third point -- I want you to know how much the American people appreciate your service. Sometimes it   s hard to acknowledge sacrifices made by the people whose work, or even identity, must remain secret, and that   s part of the enormous burden that you carry when you sign up. But you make the extraordinary sacrifice of giving up parts of your life in service to your country. Many of you take long deployments overseas. You miss seeing your families; you miss weekend barbecues and the birthday parties, watching your children grow up. You can   t even exchange in the simplest pleasures of talking about your job -- orcomplaining about your job openly. There are few signs of patriotism more powerful than offering to serve out of the limelight, and so many of you have signed up to serve after 9/11 -- that   s partly why you   re all so young -- fully aware of the dangers before you. You serve courageously, but your courage is only known to a few. You accomplish remarkable things, but the credit you receive is the private knowledge that you   ve done something to secure this country. That   s a sacrifice that   s carved into those marble walls. Those 89 stars stand as a testament to both the men and women of the CIA who gave their lives in service to their country, and to all who dedicate themselves tothe mission of this agency. Now we must look forward to the future with confidence. All that you   ve achieved, I believe that the CIA   s best days are still yet to come. And you will have my support and appreciationas you carry on this critical work. We live in dangerous times. I am going to need you more than ever, precisely because we   re seeing changes in our foreign policy, and we want to send a new message to the world. That requires better intelligence, not less of it. That means that we   re going to have to operate smarter and more effectively than ever. So I   m going to be relying on you, and the American people are going to rely on you. And I hope that you will continue to take extraordinary pridein the challenges that come with the job. Thank you very much. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America.",obama
"Thank you very much. To Sara Bloomfield, for the wonderful introduction and the outstandingwork she's doing; to Fred Zeidman; Joel Geiderman; Mr. Wiesel -- thank you for your wisdomand your witness; Speaker Nancy Pelosi; Senator Dick Durbin; members of Congress; ourgood friend the Ambassador of Israel; members of the United States Holocaust MemorialCouncil; and most importantly, the survivors and rescuers and their families who are heretoday. It is a great honor for me to be here, and I'm grateful that I have the opportunity toaddress you briefly. We gather today to mourn the loss of so many lives, and celebrate those who saved them;honor those who survived, and contemplate the obligations of the living. It is the grimmest of ironies that one of the most savage, barbaric acts of evil in history beganin one of the most modernized societies of its time, where so many markers of humanprogress became tools of human depravity: science that can heal used to kill; education thatcan enlighten used to rationalize away basic moral impulses; the bureaucracy that sustainsmodern life used as the machinery of mass death -- a ruthless, chillingly efficient systemwhere many were responsible for the killing, but few got actual blood on their hands. While the uniqueness of the Holocaust in scope and in method is truly astounding, theHolocaust was driven by many of the same forces that have fueled atrocities throughouthistory: the scapegoating that leads to hatred and blinds us to our common humanity; thejustifications that replace conscience and allow cruelty to spread; the willingness of those whoare neither perpetrators nor victims to accept the assigned role of bystander, believing the liethat good people are ever powerless or alone, the fiction that we do not have a choice. But while we are here today to bear witness to the human capacity to destroy, we are alsohere to pay tribute to the human impulse to save. In the moral accounting of the Holocaust,as we reckon with numbers like 6 million, as we recall the horror of numbers etched intoarms, we also factor in numbers like these: 7,200 -- the number of Danish Jews ferried tosafety, many of whom later returned home to find the neighbors who rescued them had alsofaithfully tended their homes and businesses and belongings while they were gone. We remember the number five -- the five righteous men and women who join us today fromPoland. We are awed by your acts of courage and conscience. And your presence todaycompels each of us to ask ourselves whether we would have done what you did. We can onlyhope that the answer is yes. We also remember the number 5,000 -- the number of Jews rescued by the villagers of LeChambon, France -- one life saved for each of its 5,000 residents. Not a single Jew who camethere was turned away, or turned in. But it was not until decades later that the villagers spokeof what they had done -- and even then, only reluctantly. The author of a book on the rescuefound that those he interviewed were baffled by his interest. ""How could you call us 'good'?""they said. ""We were doing what had to be done."" That is the question of the righteous -- those who would do extraordinary good atextraordinary risk not for affirmation or acclaim or to advance their own interests, but becauseit is what must be done. They remind us that no one is born a savior or a murderer -- theseare choices we each have the power to make. They teach us that no one can make us intobystanders without our consent, and that we are never truly alone -- that if we have thecourage to heed that ""still, small voice"" within us, we can form a minyan for righteousnessthat can span a village, even a nation. Their legacy is our inheritance. And the question is, how do we honor and preserve it? How dowe ensure that ""never again"" isn't an empty slogan, or merely an aspiration, but also a call toaction? I believe we start by doing what we are doing today -- by bearing witness, by fighting thesilence that is evil's greatest co-conspirator. In the face of horrors that defy comprehension, the impulse to silence is understandable. Myown great uncle returned from his service in World War II in a state of shock, saying little,alone with painful memories that would not leave his head. He went up into the attic,according to the stories that I've heard, and wouldn't come down for six months. He was oneof the liberators -- someone who at a very tender age had seen the unimaginable. And sosome of the liberators who are here today honor us with their presence -- all of whom wehonor for their extraordinary service. My great uncle was part of the 89th Infantry Division --the first Americans to reach a Nazi concentration camp. And they liberated Ohrdruf, part ofBuchenwald, where tens of thousands had perished. The story goes that when the Americans marched in, they discovered the starving survivorsand the piles of dead bodies. And General Eisenhower made a decision. He ordered Germansfrom the nearby town to tour the camp, so they could see what had been done in their name.And he ordered American troops to tour the camp, so they could see the evil they werefighting against. Then he invited congressmen and journalists to bear witness. And he orderedthat photographs and films be made. Some of us have seen those same images, whether inthe Holocaust Museum or when I visited Yad Vashem, and they never leave you. Eisenhowersaid that he wanted ""to be in a position to give firsthand evidence of these things, if ever, inthe future, there develops a tendency to charge these allegations merely to propaganda."" Eisenhower understood the danger of silence. He understood that if no one knew what hadhappened, that would be yet another atrocity -- and it would be the perpetrators' ultimatetriumph. What Eisenhower did to record these crimes for history is what we are doing here today.That's what Elie Wiesel and the survivors we honor here do by fighting to make theirmemories part of our collective memory. That's what the Holocaust Museum does every dayon our National Mall, the place where we display for the world our triumphs and failures andthe lessons we've learned from our history. It's the very opposite of silence. But we must also remember that bearing witness is not the end of our obligation -- it's justthe beginning. We know that evil has yet to run its course on Earth. We've seen it in thiscentury in the mass graves and the ashes of villages burned to the ground, and children usedas soldiers and rape used as a weapon of war. To this day, there are those who insist theHolocaust never happened; who perpetrate every form of intolerance -- racism and anti- Semitism, homophobia, xenophobia, sexism, and more -- hatred that degrades its victim anddiminishes us all. Today, and every day, we have an opportunity, as well as an obligation, to confront thesescourges -- to fight the impulse to turn the channel when we see images that disturb us, orwrap ourselves in the false comfort that others' sufferings are not our own. Instead we havethe opportunity to make a habit of empathy; to recognize ourselves in each other; to commitourselves to resisting injustice and intolerance and indifference in whatever forms they maytake -- whether confronting those who tell lies about history, or doing everything we can toprevent and end atrocities like those that took place in Rwanda, those taking place in Darfur.That is my commitment as President. I hope that is yours, as well. It will not be easy. At times, fulfilling these obligations require self-reflection. But in the finalanalysis, I believe history gives us cause for hope rather than despair -- the hope of a chosenpeople who have overcome oppression since the days of Exodus; of the nation of Israel risingfrom the destruction of the Holocaust; of the strong and enduring bonds between our nations. It is the hope, too, of those who not only survived, but chose to live, teaching us the meaningof courage and resilience and dignity. I'm thinking today of a study conducted after the warthat found that Holocaust survivors living in America actually had a higher birthrate thanAmerican Jews. What a stunning act of faith -- to bring a child in a world that has shown youso much cruelty; to believe that no matter what you have endured, or how much you havelost, in the end, you have a duty to life. We find cause for hope as well in Protestant and Catholic children attending school together inNorthern Ireland; in Hutus and Tutsis living side by side, forgiving neighbors who have donethe unforgivable; in a movement to save Darfur that has thousands of high school and collegechapters in 25 countries, and brought 70,000 people to the Washington Mall -- people ofevery age and faith and background and race united in common cause with suffering brothersand sisters halfway around the world. Those numbers can be our future -- our fellow citizens of the world showing us how to makethe journey from oppression to survival, from witness to resistance, and ultimately toreconciliation. That is what we mean when we say ""never again."" So today, during this season when we celebrate liberation, resurrection, and the possibility ofredemption, may each of us renew our resolve to do what must be done. And may we striveeach day, both individually and as a nation, to be among the righteous. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.",obama
"[Teleprompters rise.] Good evening. Pause for laughter. Wait a minute, this may not be working as well as I -- Letme try that again. Good evening, everybody. I would like to welcome you all to the 10-day anniversary of myfirst 100 days. I am Barack Obama. Most of you covered me. All of you voted for me.Apologies to the Fox table. They're -- Where are they? I have to confess I really did not wantto be here tonight, but I knew I had to come -- just one more problem that I've inherited fromGeorge W. Bush.But now that I'm here, it's great to be here. It's great to see all of you. Michelle Obama ishere, the First Lady of the United States. Hasn't she been an outstanding First Lady? She'seven begun to bridge the differences that have divided us for so long, because no matterwhich party you belong to we can all agree that Michelle has the right to bare arms.Now Sasha and Malia aren't here tonight because they're grounded. You can't just take AirForce One on a joy ride to Manhattan. I don't care whose kids you are. We've been settingsome ground rules here. They're starting to get a little carried away. Now, speaking -- when I think about children obviously I think about Michelle and it remindsme that tomorrow is Mother's Day. Happy Mother's Day to all the mothers in the audience. Ido have to say, though, that this is a tough holiday for Rahm Emanuel because he's not usedto saying the word ""day"" after ""mother."" That's true.David Axelrod is here. You know, David and I have been together for a long time. I can stillremember -- I got to sort of -- I tear up a little bit when I think back to that day that I calledAx so many years ago and said, you and I can do wonderful things together. And he said tome the same thing that partners all across America are saying to one another right now: Let'sgo to Iowa and make it official.Michael Steele is in the house tonight. Or as he would say, ""in the heezy."" What's up? Whereis Michael? Michael, for the last time, the Republican Party does not qualify for a bailout. RushLimbaugh does not count as a troubled asset, I'm sorry.Dick Cheney was supposed to be here but he is very busy working on his memoirs, tentativelytitled, ""How to Shoot Friends and Interrogate People.""You know, it's been a whirlwind of activity these first hundred days. We've enacted a majoreconomic recovery package, we passed a budget, we forged a new path in Iraq, and noPresident in history has ever named three Commerce Secretaries this quickly. Which remindsme, if Judd Gregg is here, your business cards are ready now.On top of that, I've also reversed the ban on stem cell research, signed an expansion --signed an expansion of the children's health insurance. Just last week, Car and Driver namedme auto executive of the year. Something I'm very proud of.We've also begun to change the culture in Washington. We've even made the White House aplace where people can learn and can grow. Just recently, Larry Summers asked if he couldchair the White House Council on Women and Girls. And I do appreciate that Larry is heretonight because it is seven hours past his bedtime. Gibbs liked that one. In the last hundred days, we've also grown the Democratic Party by infusing it with newenergy and bringing in fresh, young faces like Arlen Specter. Now, Joe Biden rightly deservesa lot of credit for convincing Arlen to make the switch, but Secretary Clinton actually had a lotto do with it too. One day she just pulled him aside and she said, Arlen, you know what Ialways say -- ""if you can't beat them, join them."" Which brings me to another thing that's changed in this new, warmer, fuzzier White House,and that's my relationship with Hillary. You know, we had been rivals during the campaign,but these days we could not be closer. In fact, the second she got back from Mexico shepulled into a hug and gave me a big kiss. Told me I'd better get down there myself. Which Ireally appreciated. I mean, it was -- it was nice. And of course we've also begun to change America's image in the world. We talked about thisduring this campaign and we're starting to execute. We've renewed alliances with importantpartners and friends. If you look on the screen there, there I am with Japanese Prime MinisterTaro Aso. There I am with Gordon Brown. But as I said during the campaign, we can't just talk to our friends. As hard as it is, we alsohave to talk to our enemies, and I've begun to do exactly that. Take a look at the monitorthere. Now, let me be clear, just because he handed me a copy of Peter Pan does not meanthat I'm going to read it -- but it's good diplomatic practice to just accept these gifts.All this change hasn't been easy. Change never is. So I've cut the tension by bringing a newfriend to the White House. He's warm, he's cuddly, loyal, enthusiastic. You just have to keephim on a tight leash. Every once in a while he goes charging off in the wrong direction andgets himself into trouble. But enough about Joe Biden. All in all, we're proud of the change we've brought to Washington in these first hundred daysbut we've got a lot of work left to do, as all of you know. So I'd like to talk a little bit aboutwhat my administration plans to achieve in the next hundred days.During the second hundred days, we will design, build and open a library dedicated to my firsthundred days. It's going to be big, folks. In the next hundred days, I will learn to go off theprompter and Joe Biden will learn to stay on the prompter. In the next hundred days, our bipartisan outreach will be so successful that even JohnBoehner will consider becoming a Democrat. After all, we have a lot in common. He is aperson of color. Although not a color that appears in the natural world. What's up, John?In the next hundred days, I will meet with a leader who rules over millions with an iron fist,who owns the airwaves and uses his power to crush all who would challenge his authority atthe ballot box. It's good to see you, Mayor Bloomberg. In the next hundred days, we will housetrain our dog, Bo, because the last thing Tim Geithnerneeds is someone else treating him like a fire hydrant. In the next hundred days, I willstrongly consider losing my cool.Finally, I believe that my next hundred days will be so successful I will be able to completethem in 72 days. And on the 73rd day, I will rest. I just -- I want to end by saying a few words about the men and women in this room whosejob it is to inform the public and pursue the truth. You know, we meet tonight at a moment ofextraordinary challenge for this nation and for the world, but it's also a time of real hardshipfor the field of journalism. And like so many other businesses in this global age, you've seensweeping changes and technology and communications that lead to a sense of uncertainty andanxiety about what the future will hold. Across the country, there are extraordinary, hardworking journalists who have lost their jobsin recent days, recent weeks, recent months. And I know that each newspaper and mediaoutlet is wrestling with how to respond to these changes, and some are struggling simply tostay open. And it won't be easy. Not every ending will be a happy one. But it's also true that your ultimate success as an industry is essential to the success of ourdemocracy. It's what makes this thing work. You know, Thomas Jefferson once said that if hehad the choice between a government without newspapers, or newspapers without agovernment, he would not hesitate to choose the latter. Clearly, Thomas Jefferson never had cable news to contend with -- but his central pointremains: A government without newspapers, a government without a tough and vibrantmedia of all sorts, is not an option for the United States of America.So I may not -- I may not agree with everything you write or report. I may even complain, ormore likely Gibbs will complain, from time to time about how you do your jobs, but I do sowith the knowledge that when you are at your best, then you help me be at my best. You helpall of us who serve at the pleasure of the American people do our jobs better by holding usaccountable, by demanding honesty, by preventing us from taking shortcuts and falling intoeasy political games that people are so desperately weary of. And that kind of reporting is worth preserving -- not just for your sake, but for the public's.We count on you to help us make sense of a complex world and tell the stories of our lives theway they happen, and we look for you for truth, even if it's always an approximation, even if - - This is a season of renewal and reinvention. That is what government must learn to do, that'swhat businesses must learn to do, and that's what journalism is in the process of doing. Andwhen I look out at this room and think about the dedicated men and women whose questionsI've answered over the last few years, I know that for all the challenges this industry faces,it's not short on talent or creativity or passion or commitment. It's not short of young peoplewho are eager to break news or the not-so-young who still manage to ask the tough onestime and time again. These qualities alone will not solve all your problems, but they certainlyprove that the problems are worth solving. And that is a good place as any to begin.So I offer you my thanks, I offer you my support, and I look forward to working with you andanswering to you and the American people as we seek a more perfect union in the monthsand years ahead.Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.",obama
"President  Obama:  Thank  you  very  much.  Thank  you,  Notre  Dame.  Thank  you.  Thank  you.   Please,  have  a  seat.  Thank  you...   Well  first  of  all,  congratulations,  Class  of  2009.  Congratulations  to  all  the  parents,  the  cousins,   the  aunts,  the  uncles        all  the  people  who  helped  to  bring  you  to  the  point  that  you  are  here   today.  Thank  you  so  much  to  Father  Jenkins  for  that  extraordinary  introduction,  even  though   you  said  what  I  want  to  say  much  more  elegantly.  You  are  doing  an  extraordinary  job  as   president  of  this  extraordinary  institution,  and  your  continued  and  courageous  and  contagious   commitment  to  honest,  thoughtful  dialogue  is  an  inspiration  to  us  all.   So,  good  afternoon,  to  Father  Hesburgh,  to  Notre  Dame  trustees,  to  faculty,  to  family.  I  am   honored  to  be  here  today.  And  I  am  grateful  to  all  of  you  for  allowing  me  to  be  a  part  of  your   graduation.  And  I  also  want  to  thank  you  for  the  honorary  degree  that  I  received.  I  know  it   has  not  been  without  controversy.  I  don't  know  if  you're  aware  of  this,  but  these  honorary   degrees  are  apparently  pretty  hard  to  come  by.  So  far  I'm  only  1  for  2  as  President.   Father...Hesburgh  is  150  for  150.  I  guess  that's  better.  So,  Father  Ted  after  the  ceremony   maybe  you  can  give  me  some  pointers  to  boost  my  average.   I  also  want  to  congratulate  the  Class  of  2009  for  all  your  accomplishments.  And  since         [Audience  member  interrupts  with  pro  life  slogans]   President  Obama:  And  since        this  is  Notre  Dame   That's...all  right.  And  since         [Audience  chants  ""We  are  ND!  We  are  ND!""] Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Property  of  .       Copyright  2009.  All  rights  reserved.   Page  1      President  Obama:  We're  fine,  everybody.  We're  following  Brennan's  adage  that  we  don't  do   things  easily.  We're  not  going  to  shy  away  from  things  that  are  uncomfortable  sometimes.   Now,  since        since  this  is  Notre  Dame  I  think  we  should  talk  not  only  about  your   accomplishments  in  the  classroom,  but  also  in  the  competitive  arena.  No,  don't  worry,  I'm  not   going  to  talk  about  that.  We  all  know  about  this  university's  proud  and  storied  football  team,   but  I  also  hear  that  Notre  Dame  holds  the  largest  outdoor  5  on  5  basketball  tournament  in   the  world        ""Bookstore  Basketball.""   Now  this  excites  me.  I  want  to  congratulate  the  winners  of  this  year's  tournament,  a  team  by   the  name  of  ""Hallelujah  Holla  Back.""  Congratulations.  Well  done.  Though  I  have  to  say,  I'm   personally  disappointed  that  the  ""Barack  O'Ballers""  did  not  pull  it  out  this  year.  So  next  year,   if  you  need  a  6'2""  forward  with  a  decent  jumper,  you  know  where  I  live.   Now,  every  one  of  you  should  be  proud  of  what  you've  achieved  at  this  institution.  One   hundred  and  sixty  three  classes  of  Notre  Dame  graduates  have  sat  where  you  sit  today.  Some   were  here  during  years  that  simply  rolled  into  the  next  without  much  notice  or  fanfare         periods  of  relative  peace  and  prosperity  that  required  little  by  way  of  sacrifice  or  struggle.   You,  however,  are  not  getting  off  that  easy.  You  have  a  different  deal.  Your  class  has  come  of   age  at  a  moment  of  great  consequence  for  our  nation  and  for  the  world        a  rare  inflection   point  in  history  where  the  size  and  scope  of  the  challenges  before  us  require  that  we  remake   our  world  to  renew  its  promise,  that  we  align  our  deepest  values  and  commitments  to  the   demands  of  a  new  age.  It's  a  privilege  and  a  responsibility  afforded  to  few  generations        and   a  task  that  you're  now  called  to  fulfill.   This  generation,  your  generation  is  the  one  that  must  find  a  path  back  to  prosperity  and   decide  how  we  respond  to  a  global  economy  that  left  millions  behind  even  before  the  most   recent  crisis  hit        an  economy  where  greed  and  short  term  thinking  were  too  often  rewarded   at  the  expense  of  fairness,  and  diligence,  and  an  honest  day's  work.   Your  generation  must  decide  how  to  save  God's  creation  from  a  changing  climate  that   threatens  to  destroy  it.  Your  generation  must  seek  peace  at  a  time  when  there  are  those  who   will  stop  at  nothing  to  do  us  harm,  and  when  weapons  in  the  hands  of  a  few  can  destroy  the   many.  And  we  must  find  a  way  to  reconcile  our  ever  shrinking  world  with  its  ever  growing   diversity        diversity  of  thought,  diversity  of  culture,  and  diversity  of  belief.   In  short,  we  must  find  a  way  to  live  together  as  one  human  family.  And  it's  this  last  challenge   that  I'd  like  to  talk  about  today,  despite  the  fact  that  Father  John  stole  all  my  best  lines.  For   the  major  threats  we  face  in  the  21st  century        whether  it's  global  recession  or  violent   extremism,  the  spread  of  nuclear  weapons  or  pandemic  disease        these  things  do  not   discriminate.  They  do  not  recognize  borders.  They  do  not  see  color.  They  do  not  target  specific   ethnic  groups.  Moreover,  no  one  person,  or  religion,  or  nation  can  meet  these  challenges   alone.  Our  very  survival  has  never  required  greater  cooperation  and  greater  understanding   among  all  people  from  all  places  than  at  this  moment  in  history. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Property  of  .       Copyright  2009.  All  rights  reserved.   Page  2      Unfortunately,  finding  that  common  ground        recognizing  that  our  fates  are  tied  up,  as  Dr.   King  said,  in  a  ""single  garment  of  destiny""        is  not  easy.  And  part  of  the  problem,  of  course,   lies  in  the  imperfections  of  man        our  selfishness,  our  pride,  our  stubbornness,  our   acquisitiveness,  our  insecurities,  our  egos        all  the  cruelties  large  and  small  that  those  of  us   in  the  Christian  tradition  understand  to  be  rooted  in  original  sin.  We  too  often  seek  advantage   over  others.  We  cling  to  outworn  prejudice  and  fear  those  who  are  unfamiliar.  Too  many  of  us   view  life  only  through  the  lens  of  immediate  self  interest  and  crass  materialism        in  which  the   world  is  necessarily  a  zero  sum  game.  The  strong  too  often  dominate  the  weak,  and  too  many   of  those  with  wealth  and  with  power  find  all  manner  of  justification  for  their  own  privilege  in   the  face  of  poverty  and  injustice.   And  so  for  all  our  technology  and  scientific  advances,  we  see  here  in  this  country  and  around   the  globe  violence  and  want  and  strife  that  would  seem  sadly  familiar  to  those  in  ancient   times.  We  know  these  things.  And  hopefully  one  of  the  benefits  of  the  wonderful  education   that  you  have  received  here  at  Notre  Dame  is  that  you've  had  time  to  consider  these  wrongs   in  the  world,  perhaps  recognized  impulses  in  yourself  that  you  want  to  leave  behind.  You've   grown  determined        each  in  your  own  way        to  right  them.  And  yet  one  of  the  vexing  things   for  those  of  us  interested  in  promoting  greater  understanding  and  cooperation  among  people   is  the  discovery  that  even  bringing  together  persons  of  good  will,  bringing  together  men  and   women  of  principle  and  purpose        even  accomplishing  that  can  be  difficult.   The  soldier  and  the  lawyer  may  both  love  this  country  with  equal  passion,  and  yet  reach  very   different  conclusions  on  the  specific  steps  needed  to  protect  us  from  harm.  The  gay  activist   and  the  evangelical  pastor  may  both  deplore  the  ravages  of  HIV/AIDS,  but  find  themselves   unable  to  bridge  the  cultural  divide  that  might  unite  their  efforts.  Those  who  speak  out  against   stem  cell  research  may  be  rooted  in  an  admirable  conviction  about  the  sacredness  of  life,  but   so  are  the  parents  of  a  child  with  juvenile  diabetes  who  are  convinced  that  their  son's  or   daughter's  hardships  might  be  relieved.   The  question,  then,  is  how  do  we  work  through  these  conflicts?  Is  it  possible  for  us  to  join   hands  in  common  effort?  As  citizens  of  a  vibrant  and  varied  democracy,  how  do  we  engage  in   vigorous  debate?  How  does  each  of  us  remain  firm  in  our  principles,  and  fight  for  what  we   consider  right,  without,  as  Father  John  said,  demonizing  those  with  just  as  strongly  held   convictions  on  the  other  side?  And  of  course,  nowhere  do  these  questions  come  up  more   powerfully  than  on  the  issue  of  abortion.   As  I  considered  the  controversy  surrounding  my  visit  here,  I  was  reminded  of  an  encounter  I   had  during  my  Senate  campaign,  one  that  I  describe  in  a  book  I  wrote  called  The  Audacity  of   Hope.  In  a  few  days  after  I  won  the  Democratic  nomination,  I  received  an  e  mail  from  a   doctor  who  told  me  that  while  he  voted  for  me  in  the  Illinois  primary,  he  had  a  serious   concern  that  might  prevent  him  from  voting  for  me  in  the  general  election.  He  described   himself  as  a  Christian  who  was  strongly  pro  life        but  that  was  not  what  was  preventing  him   potentially  from  voting  for  me. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Property  of  .       Copyright  2009.  All  rights  reserved.   Page  3      What  bothered  the  doctor  was  an  entry  that  my  campaign  staff  had  posted  on  my  website         an  entry  that  said  I  would  fight,  quote,  ""right  wing  ideologues  who  want  to  take  away  a   woman's  right  to  choose,""  unquote.  The  doctor  said  he  had  assumed  I  was  a  reasonable   person.  He  supported  my  policy  initiatives  to  help  the  poor  and  to  lift  up  our  educational   system,  but  that  if  I  truly  believed  that  every  pro  life  individual  was  simply  an  ideologue  who   wanted  to  inflict  suffering  on  women,  then  I  was  not  very  reasonable.  He  wrote,  ""I  do  not  ask   at  this  point  that  you  oppose  abortion,  only  that  you  speak  about  this  issue  in  fair  minded   words.""   Fair  minded  words.   After  I  read  the  doctor's  letter,  I  wrote  back  to  him  and  I  thanked  him.  And  I  didn't  change  my   underlying  position,  but  I  did  tell  my  staff  to  change  the  words  on  my  website.  And  I  said  a   prayer  that  night  that  I  might  extend  the  same  presumption  of  good  faith  to  others  that  the   doctor  had  extended  to  me    because  when  we  do  that        when  we  open  up  our  hearts  and  our   minds  to  those  who  may  not  think  precisely  like  we  do  or  believe  precisely  what  we  believe         that's  when  we  discover  at  least  the  possibility  of  common  ground.  That's  when  we  begin  to   say,  ""Maybe  we  won't  agree  on  abortion,  but  we  can  still  agree  that  this  heart  wrenching   decision  for  any  woman  is  not  made  casually,  and  it  has  both  moral  and  spiritual  dimensions.   So  let  us  work  together  to  reduce  the  number  of  women  seeking  abortions.  Let's  reduce   unintended  pregnancies.  Let's  make  adoption  more  available.  Let's  provide  care  and  support   for  women  who  do  carry  their  children  to  term.  Let's  honor  the  conscience  of  those  who   disagree  with  abortion,  and  draft  a  sensible  conscience  clause,  and  make  sure  that  all  of  our   health  care  policies  are  grounded  not  only  in  sound  science,  but  also  in  clear  ethics,  as  well  as   respect  for  the  equality  of  women.  Those  are  things  we  can  do.   Now,  understand,  Class  of  2009,  I  do  not  suggest  that  the  debate  surrounding  abortion  can  or   should  go  away,  because  no  matter  how  much  we  may  want  to  fudge  it        indeed,  while  we   know  that  the  views  of  most  Americans  on  the  subject  are  complex  and  even  contradictory         the  fact  is  that  at  some  level,  the  views  of  the  two  camps  are  irreconcilable.  Each  side  will   continue  to  make  its  case  to  the  public  with  passion  and  conviction.  But  surely  we  can  do  so   without  reducing  those  with  differing  views  to  caricature.   Open  hearts.  Open  minds.  Fair  minded  words.  It's  a  way  of  life  that  has  always  been  the   Notre  Dame  tradition.  Father  Hesburgh  has  long  spoken  of  this  institution  as  both  a  lighthouse   and  a  crossroads,  a  lighthouse  that  stands  apart,  shining  with  the  wisdom  of  the  Catholic   tradition,  while  the  crossroads  is  where  ""differences  of  culture  and  religion  and  conviction  can   co  exist  with  friendship,  civility,  hospitality,  and  especially  love.""  And  I  want  to  join  him  and   Father  John  in  saying  how  inspired  I  am  by  the  maturity  and  responsibility  with  which  this   class  has  approached  the  debate  surrounding  today's  ceremony.  You  are  an  example  of  what   Notre  Dame  is  about.   Now,  this  tradition  of  cooperation  and  understanding  is  one  that  I  learned  in  my  own  life  many   years  ago        also  with  the  help  of  the  Catholic  Church.

Page  4      You  see,  I  was  not  raised  in  a  particularly  religious  household,  but  my  mother  instilled  in  me  a   sense  of  service  and  empathy  that  eventually  led  me  to  become  a  community  organizer  after  I   graduated  college.  And  a  group  of  Catholic  churches  in  Chicago  helped  fund  an  organization   known  as  the  ""Developing  Communities  Project,""  and  we  worked  to  lift  up  South  Side   neighborhoods  that  had  been  devastated  when  the  local  steel  plant  closed.   And  it  was  quite  an  eclectic  crew        Catholic  and  Protestant  churches,  Jewish  and  African   American  organizers,  working  class  black,  white,  and  Hispanic  residents        all  of  us  with   different  experiences,  all  of  us  with  different  beliefs    but  all  of  us  learned  to  work  side  by  side   because  all  of  us  saw  in  these  neighborhoods  other  human  beings  who  needed  our  help  to  find   jobs  and  improve  schools.  We  were  bound  together  in  the  service  of  others.   And  something  else  happened  during  the  time  I  spent  in  these  neighborhoods,  perhaps   because  the  church  folks  I  worked  with  were  so  welcoming  and  understanding    perhaps   because  they  invited  me  to  their  services  and  sang  with  me  from  their  hymnals    perhaps   because  I  was  really  broke  and  they  fed  me    perhaps  because  I  witnessed  all  of  the  good   works  their  faith  inspired  them  to  perform,  I  found  myself  drawn  not  just  to  the  work  with  the   church    I  was  drawn  to  be  in  the  church.  It  was  through  this  service  that  I  was  brought  to   Christ.   And  at  the  time,  Cardinal  Joseph  Bernardin  was  the  Archbishop  of  Chicago.  And  for  those  of   you  too  young  to  have  known  him  or  known  of  him,  he  was  a  kind  and  good  and  wise  man    a   saintly  man.  I  can  still  remember  him  speaking  at  one  of  the  first  organizing  meetings  I   attended  on  the  South  Side.  He  stood  as  both  a  lighthouse  and  a  crossroads        unafraid  to   speak  his  mind  on  moral  issues  ranging  from  poverty  and  AIDS  and  abortion  to  the  death   penalty  and  nuclear  war.  And  yet,  he  was  congenial  and  gentle  in  his  persuasion,  always   trying  to  bring  people  together,  always  trying  to  find  common  ground.  And  just  before  he   died,  a  reporter  asked  Cardinal  Bernardin  about  this  approach  to  his  ministry.  And  he  said,   ""You  can't  really  get  on  with  preaching  the  Gospel  until  you've  touched  hearts  and  minds.""   My  heart  and  mind  were  touched  by  him.  They  were  touched  by  the  words  and  deeds  of  the   men  and  women  I  worked  alongside  in  parishes  across  Chicago.  And  I'd  like  to  think  that  we   touched  the  hearts  and  minds  of  the  neighborhood  families  whose  lives  we  helped  change.  For   this,  I  believe,  is  our  highest  calling.   Now,  you,  Class  of  2009,  are  about  to  enter  the  next  phase  of  your  life  at  a  time  of  great   uncertainty.  You'll  be  called  to  help  restore  a  free  market  that's  also  fair  to  all  who  are  willing   to  work.  You'll  be  called  to  seek  new  sources  of  energy  that  can  save  our  planet    to  give   future  generations  the  same  chance  that  you  had  to  receive  an  extraordinary  education.  And   whether  as  a  person  drawn  to  public  service,  or  simply  someone  who  insists  on  being  an   active  citizen,  you  will  be  exposed  to  more  opinions  and  ideas  broadcast  through  more  means   of  communication  than  ever  existed  before.  You'll  hear  talking  heads  scream  on  cable    and   you'll  read  blogs  that  claim  definitive  knowledge    and  you  will  watch  politicians  pretend  they   know  what  they're  talking  about. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Property  of  .       Copyright  2009.  All  rights  reserved.   Page  5      Occasionally,  you  may  have  the  great  fortune  of  actually  seeing  important  issues  debated  by   people  who  do  know  what  they're  talking  about        by  well  intentioned  people  with  brilliant   minds  and  mastery  of  the  facts.  In  fact,  I  suspect  that  some  of  you  will  be  among  those   brightest  stars.   And  in  this  world  of  competing  claims  about  what  is  right  and  what  is  true,  have  confidence  in   the  values  with  which  you've  been  raised  and  educated.  Be  unafraid  to  speak  your  mind  when   those  values  are  at  stake.  Hold  firm  to  your  faith  and  allow  it  to  guide  you  on  your  journey.  In   other  words,  stand  as  a  lighthouse.  But  remember,  too,  that  you  can  be  a  crossroads.   Remember,  too,  that  the  ultimate  irony  of  faith  is  that  it  necessarily  admits  doubt.  It's  the   belief  in  things  not  seen.  It's  beyond  our  capacity  as  human  beings  to  know  with  certainty   what  God  has  planned  for  us  or  what  He  asks  of  us.  And  those  of  us  who  believe  must  trust   that  His  wisdom  is  greater  than  our  own.   And  this  doubt  should  not  push  us  away  our  faith.  But  it  should  humble  us.  It  should  temper   our  passions,  cause  us  to  be  wary  of  too  much  self  righteousness.  It  should  compel  us  to   remain  open  and  curious  and  eager  to  continue  the  spiritual  and  moral  debate  that  began  for   so  many  of  you  within  the  walls  of  Notre  Dame.  And  within  our  vast  democracy,  this  doubt   should  remind  us  even  as  we  cling  to  our  faith  to  persuade  through  reason,  through  an   appeal,  whenever  we  can,  to  universal  rather  than  parochial  principles,  and  most  of  all   through  an  abiding  example  of  good  works  and  charity  and  kindness  and  service  that  moves   hearts  and  minds.   For  if  there  is  one  law  that  we  can  be  most  certain  of,  it  is  the  law  that  binds  people  of  all   faiths  and  no  faith  together.  It's  no  coincidence  that  it  exists  in  Christianity  and  Judaism,  in   Islam  and  Hinduism,  in  Buddhism  and  humanism.  It  is,  of  course,  the  Golden  Rule        the  call   to  treat  one  another  as  we  wish  to  be  treated.  The  call  to  love.  The  call  to  serve.  To  do  what   we  can  to  make  a  difference  in  the  lives  of  those  with  whom  we  share  the  same  brief  moment   on  this  Earth.  So  many  of  you  at  Notre  Dame        by  the  last  count,  upwards  of  80  percent         have  lived  this  law  of  love  through  the  service  you've  performed  at  schools  and  hospitals,   international  relief  agencies  and  local  charities.  Brennan  is  just  one  example  of  what  your   class  has  accomplished.  That's  incredibly  impressive,  a  powerful  testament  to  this  institution.   And  now  you  must  carry  the  tradition  forward.  Make  it  a  way  of  life.  Because  when  you  serve,   it  doesn't  just  improve  your  community,  it  makes  you  a  part  of  your  community.  It  breaks   down  walls.  It  fosters  cooperation.  And  when  that  happens        when  people  set  aside  their   differences,  even  for  a  moment,  to  work  in  common  effort  toward  a  common  goal    when  they   struggle  together,  and  sacrifice  together,  and  learn  from  one  another        then  all  things  are   possible.   After  all,  I  stand  here  today,  as  President  and  as  an  African  American,  on  the  55th  anniversary   of  the  day  that  the  Supreme  Court  handed  down  the  decision  in  Brown  versus  Board  of   Education.  Now,  Brown  was  of  course  the  first  major  step  in  dismantling  the  ""separate  but   equal""  doctrine.  But  it  would  take  a  number  of  years  and  a  nationwide  movement  to  fully   realize  the  dream  of  civil  rights  for  all  of  God's  children. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Property  of  .       Copyright  2009.  All  rights  reserved.   Page  6      There  were  freedom  rides  and  lunch  counters  and  Billy  clubs,  and  there  was  also  a  Civil  Rights   Commission  appointed  by  President  Eisenhower.  It  was  the  12  resolutions  recommended  by   this  commission  that  would  ultimately  become  law  in  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964.   There  were  six  members  of  this  commission.  It  included  five  whites  and  one  African  American,   Democrats  and  Republicans,  two  Southern  governors,  the  dean  of  a  Southern  law  school,  a   Midwestern  university  president,  and  your  own  Father  Ted  Hesburgh,  President  of  Notre   Dame.  So  they  worked  for  two  years,  and  at  times  President  Eisenhower  had  to  intervene   personally  since  no  hotel  or  restaurant  in  the  South  would  serve  the  black  and  white  members   of  the  commission  together.  And  finally  when  they  reached  an  impasse  in  Louisiana,  Father   Ted  flew  them  all  to  Notre  Dame's  retreat  in  Land  O'Lakes,  Wisconsin        where  they  eventually   overcame  their  differences  and  hammered  out  a  final  deal.   And  years  later,  President  Eisenhower  asked  Father  Ted  how  on  earth  he  was  able  to  broker   an  agreement  between  men  of  such  different  backgrounds  and  beliefs.  And  Father  Ted  simply   said  that  during  their  first  dinner  in  Wisconsin  they  discovered  they  were  all  fishermen.  And  so   he  quickly  readied  a  boat  for  a  twilight  trip  out  on  the  lake.  They  fished,  and  they  talked,  and   they  changed  the  course  of  history.   I  will  not  pretend  that  the  challenges  we  face  will  be  easy,  or  that  the  answers  will  come   quickly,  or  that  all  our  differences  and  divisions  will  fade  happily  away        because  life  is  not   that  simple.  It  never  has  been.  But  as  you  leave  here  today,  remember  the  lessons  of  Cardinal   Bernardin,  of  Father  Hesburgh,  of  movements  for  change  both  large  and  small.  Remember   that  each  of  us,  endowed  with  the  dignity  possessed  by  all  children  of  God,  has  the  grace  to   recognize  ourselves  in  one  another    to  understand  that  we  all  seek  the  same  love  of  family,   the  same  fulfillment  of  a  life  well  lived.  Remember  that  in  the  end,  in  some  way  we  are  all   fishermen.   If  nothing  else,  that  knowledge  should  give  us  faith  that  through  our  collective  labor,  and   God's  providence,  and  our  willingness  to  shoulder  each  other's  burdens,  America  will  continue   on  its  precious  journey  towards  that  more  perfect  union.  Congratulations,  Class  of  2009.   May  God  bless  you,  and  may  God  bless  the  United  States  of  America. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Property  of  .

"We meet today at a transformational moment -- a moment in history when our interconnectedworld presents us, at once, with great promise but also great peril. Now, over the past four months my Administration has taken decisive steps to seize thepromise and confront these perils. We're working to recover from a global recession whilelaying a new foundation for lasting prosperity. We're strengthening our armed forces as theyfight two wars, at the same time we're renewing American leadership to confrontunconventional challenges, from nuclear proliferation to terrorism, from climate change topandemic disease. And we're bringing to government -- and to this White House --unprecedented transparency and accountability and new ways for Americans to participate intheir democracy. But none of this progress would be possible, and none of these 21st century challenges can befully met, without America's digital infrastructure -- the backbone that underpins a prosperouseconomy and a strong military and an open and efficient government. Without that foundationwe can't get the job done. It's long been said that the revolutions in communications and information technology havegiven birth to a virtual world. But make no mistake: This world -- cyberspace -- is a world thatwe depend on every single day. It's our hardware and our software, our desktops and laptopsand cell phones and Blackberries that have become woven into every aspect of our lives. It's the broadband networks beneath us and the wireless signals around us, the local networksin our schools and hospitals and businesses, and the massive grids that power our nation. It'sthe classified military and intelligence networks that keep us safe, and the World Wide Webthat has made us more interconnected than at any time in human history. So cyberspace is real. And so are the risks that come with it. It's the great irony of our Information Age -- the very technologies that empower us to createand to build also empower those who would disrupt and destroy. And this paradox -- seen andunseen -- is something that we experience every day. It's about the privacy and the economic security of American families. We rely on the Internetto pay our bills, to bank, to shop, to file our taxes. But we've had to learn a whole newvocabulary just to stay ahead of the cyber criminals who would do us harm: spyware andmalware and spoofing and phishing and botnets. Millions of Americans have been victimized,their privacy violated, their identities stolen, their lives upended, and their walletsemptied. According to one survey, in the past two years alone cyber crime has cost Americansmore than 8 billion dollars. I know how it feels to have privacy violated because it has happened to me and the peoplearound me. It's no secret that my presidential campaign harnessed the Internet andtechnology to transform our politics. What isn't widely known is that during the generalelection hackers managed to penetrate our computer systems. To all of you who donated toour campaign, I want you to all rest assured, our fundraising website was untouched. So yourconfidential personal and financial information was protected. But between August and October, hackers gained access to emails and a range of campaignfiles, from policy position papers to travel plans. And we worked closely with the CIA, with theFBI and the Secret Service, and hired security consultants to restore the security of oursystems. It was a powerful reminder: In this Information Age, one of your greatest strengths-- in our case, our ability to communicate to a wide range of supporters through the Internet - - could also be one of your greatest vulnerabilities. This is a matter, as well, of America's economic competitiveness. The small businesswoman inSt. Louis, the bond trader in the New York Stock Exchange, the workers at a global shippingcompany in Memphis, the young entrepreneur in Silicon Valley -- they all need the networksto make the next payroll, the next trade, the next delivery, the next great breakthrough. E- commerce alone last year accounted for some 132 billion dollars in retail sales. But every day we see waves of cyber thieves trolling for sensitive information -- thedisgruntled employee on the inside, the lone hacker a thousand miles away, organized crime,the industrial spy and, increasingly, foreign intelligence services. In one brazen act last year,thieves used stolen credit card information to steal millions of dollars from 130 ATM machinesin 49 cities around the world -- and they did it in just 30 minutes. A single employee of an American company was convicted of stealing intellectual propertyreportedly worth 400 million dollars. It's been estimated that last year alone cyber criminalsstole intellectual property from businesses worldwide worth up to 1 trillion dollars. In short, America's economic prosperity in the 21st century will depend on cybersecurity. And this is also a matter of public safety and national security. We count on computernetworks to deliver our oil and gas, our power and our water. We rely on them for publictransportation and air traffic control. Yet we know that cyber intruders have probed ourelectrical grid and that in other countries cyber attacks have plunged entire cities intodarkness. Our technological advantage is a key to America's military dominance. But our defense andmilitary networks are under constant attack. Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups have spokenof their desire to unleash a cyber attack on our country -- attacks that are harder to detectand harder to defend against. Indeed, in today's world, acts of terror could come not onlyfrom a few extremists in suicide vests but from a few key strokes on the computer -- aweapon of mass disruption. In one of the most serious cyber incidents to date against our military networks, severalthousand computers were infected last year by malicious software -- malware. And while nosensitive information was compromised, our troops and defense personnel had to give upthose external memory devices -- thumb drives -- changing the way they used theircomputers every day. And last year we had a glimpse of the future face of war. As Russian tanks rolled into Georgia,cyber attacks crippled Georgian government websites. The terrorists that sowed so muchdeath and destruction in Mumbai relied not only on guns and grenades but also on GPS andphones using voice-over-the-Internet. For all these reasons, it's now clear this cyber threat is one of the most serious economic andnational security challenges we face as a nation. It's also clear that we're not as prepared as we should be, as a government or as a country. In recent years, some progress has been made at the federal level. But just as we failed in thepast to invest in our physical infrastructure -- our roads, our bridges and rails -- we've failedto invest in the security of our digital infrastructure. No single official oversees cybersecurity policy across the federal government, and no singleagency has the responsibility or authority to match the scope and scale of thechallenge. Indeed, when it comes to cybersecurity, federal agencies have overlappingmissions and don't coordinate and communicate nearly as well as they should -- with eachother or with the private sector. We saw this in the disorganized response to Conficker, theInternet worm that in recent months has infected millions of computers around the world. This status quo is no longer acceptable -- not when there's so much at stake. We can and wemust do better. And that's why shortly after taking office I directed my National Security Council andHomeland Security Council to conduct a top-to-bottom review of the federal government'sefforts to defend our information and communications infrastructure and to recommend thebest way to ensure that these networks are able to secure our networks as well as ourprosperity. Our review was open and transparent. I want to acknowledge, Melissa Hathaway -- who ishere -- who is the Acting Senior Director for Cyberspace on our National Security Council, wholed the review team, as well as the Center for Strategic and International Studies bipartisanCommission on Cybersecurity, and all who were part of our 60-day review team. They listenedto a wide variety of groups, many of which are represented here today and I want to thank fortheir input: industry and academia, civil liberties and private -- privacy advocates. We listenedto every level and branch of government -- from local to state to federal, civilian, military,homeland as well as intelligence, Congress and international partners, as well. I consultedwith my national security teams, my homeland security teams, and my economic advisors. Today I'm releasing a report on our review, and can announce that my Administration willpursue a new comprehensive approach to securing America's digital infrastructure. This new approach starts at the top, with this commitment from me: From now on, our digitalinfrastructure -- the networks and computers we depend on every day -- will be treated asthey should be: as a strategic national asset. Protecting this infrastructure will be a nationalsecurity priority. We will ensure that these networks are secure, trustworthy and resilient. Wewill deter, prevent, detect, and defend against attacks and recover quickly from anydisruptions or damage. To give these efforts the high-level focus and attention they deserve -- and as part of thenew, single National Security Staff announced this week -- I'm creating a new office here atthe White House that will be led by the Cybersecurity Coordinator. Because of the criticalimportance of this work, I will personally select this official. I'll depend on this official in allmatters relating to cybersecurity, and this official will have my full support and regular accessto me as we confront these challenges. Today, I want to focus on the important responsibilities this office will fulfill: orchestrating andintegrating all cybersecurity policies for the government; working closely with the Office ofManagement and Budget to ensure agency budgets reflect those priorities; and, in the eventof major cyber incident or attack, coordinating our response. To ensure that federal cyber policies enhance our security and our prosperity, myCybersecurity Coordinator will be a member of the National Security Staff as well as the staffof my National Economic Council. To ensure that policies keep faith with our fundamental values, this office will also include anofficial with a portfolio specifically dedicated to safeguarding the privacy and civil liberties ofthe American people. There's much work to be done, and the report we're releasing today outlines a range ofactions that we will pursue in five key areas. First, working in partnership with the communities represented here today, we will develop anew comprehensive strategy to secure America's information and communications networks.To ensure a coordinated approach across government, my Cybersecurity Coordinator will workclosely with my Chief Technology Officer, Aneesh Chopra, and my Chief Information Officer,Vivek Kundra. To ensure accountability in federal agencies, cybersecurity will be designated asone of my key management priorities. Clear milestones and performances metrics willmeasure progress. And as we develop our strategy, we will be open and transparent, which iswhy you'll find today's report and a wealth of related information on our Web site,www.whitehouse.gov. Second, we will work with all the key players -- including state and local governments and theprivate sector -- to ensure an organized and unified response to future cyber incidents. Giventhe enormous damage that can be caused by even a single cyber attack, ad hoc responses willnot do. Nor is it sufficient to simply strengthen our defenses after incidents or attacksoccur. Just as we do for natural disasters, we have to have plans and resources in placebeforehand -- sharing information, issuing warnings and ensuring a coordinated response. Third, we will strengthen the public/private partnerships that are critical to this endeavor. Thevast majority of our critical information infrastructure in the United States is owned andoperated by the private sector. So let me be very clear: My Administration will not dictatesecurity standards for private companies. On the contrary, we will collaborate with industry tofind technology solutions that ensure our security and promote prosperity. Fourth, we will continue to invest in the cutting-edge research and development necessary forthe innovation and discovery we need to meet the digital challenges of our time. And that'swhy my Administration is making major investments in our information infrastructure: layingbroadband lines to every corner of America; building a smart electric grid to deliver energymore efficiently; pursuing a next generation of air traffic control systems; and moving toelectronic health records, with privacy protections, to reduce costs and save lives. And finally, we will begin a national campaign to promote cybersecurity awareness and digitalliteracy from our boardrooms to our classrooms, and to build a digital workforce for the 21stcentury. And that's why we're making a new commitment to education in math and science,and historic investments in science and research and development. Because it's not enoughfor our children and students to master today's technologies -- social networking and e- mailing and texting and blogging -- we need them to pioneer the technologies that will allow us to work effectively through these new media and allow us to prosper in the future. Sothese are the things we will do. Let me also be clear about what we will not do. Our pursuit of cybersecurity will not -- Irepeat, will not include -- monitoring private sector networks or Internet traffic. We will preserve and protect the personal privacy and civil liberties that we cherish asAmericans. Indeed, I remain firmly committed to net neutrality so we can keep the Internet asit should be -- open and free. The task I have described will not be easy. Some 1.5 billion people around the world arealready online, and more are logging on every day. Groups and governments are sharpeningtheir cyber capabilities. Protecting our prosperity and security in this globalized world is goingto be a long, difficult struggle demanding patience and persistence over many years. But we need to remember: We're only at the beginning. The epochs of history are long -- theAgricultural Revolution; the Industrial Revolution. By comparison, our Information Age is stillin its infancy. We're only at Web 2.0. Now our virtual world is going viral. And we've only justbegun to explore the next generation of technologies that will transform our lives in ways wecan't even begin to imagine. So a new world awaits -- a world of greater security and greater potential prosperity -- if wereach for it, if we lead. So long as I'm President of the United States, we will do just that. Andthe United States -- the nation that invented the Internet, that launched an informationrevolution, that transformed the world -- will do what we did in the 20th century and leadonce more in the 21st. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.",obama
"Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  President.  Today,  we  mourn  the  passing  of  Coretta  Scott  King.   And  when  I  think  about  Coretta  Scott  King,  I  think  about  the  little  girl  who  walked  five  miles   to  school  on  those  rural  Alabama  roads  and  felt  the  heat  of  racism  each  day  she  passed  the   door  of  the  Whites  only  school,  so  much  closer  to  home.  It  didn't  matter,  because  she  studied   and  succeeded  and  excelled  beyond  most  of  her  classmates,  Black  and  White.  She  earned  a   college  degree,  and  an  acceptance  to  a  prestigious  graduate  school  up  North.   And  one  day  she  met  a  young  preacher  from  Atlanta,  and  she  fell  in  love  with  him.  And  he   told  her  his  dreams        and  she  believed  in  those  dreams.  And  she  decided  that  she  would  help   to  make  them  real        not  just  as  a  wife  or  as  a  friend,  but  as  a  partner  in  freedom's  cause.   Over  the  next  years,  Coretta  Scott  King  did  that  in  so  many  ways  we  can't  even  imagine.  She   raised  a  family,  she  marched  through  the  streets,  she  inspired  through  song,  she  led  through   speech        even  dodged  the  countless  attempts  on  her  family's  life.  And  when  one  of  those   attempts  finally  took  her  love  from  this  world,  she  made  the  selfless  decision  to  carry  on. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.

Page  1      With  no  time  to  even  cry  or  mourn,  to  wallow  in  anger  or  vengeance,  Coretta  Scott  King  took   to  the  streets  just  four  days  after  the  assassination  and  led  50,000  through  the  streets  of   Memphis  in  a  march  for  the  kind  of  justice  that  her  husband  had  given  his  life  for.  She  spent   the  rest  of  here  marching  for  that  same  justice        leading  the  King  Center  for  Nonviolent   Social  Change  in  Atlanta,  and  spreading  her  family's  message  of  hope  to  every  corner  of  this   world.   You  know,  I  had  the  great  honor  of  knowing  Mrs.  King,  and  the  occasion  to  visit  with  her  in   Atlanta  last  year.  She  was  an  extraordinarily  gracious  woman.  We  sat  and  chatted  in  her  living   room.  She  showed  me  an  album  of  photographs  of  her  and  Dr.  King  and  the  children.  And   then  she  told  me  what  her  husband  had  said  to  her  once,  at  a  time  when  she  was  feeling   burdened,  understandably,  by  all  the  stress  and  strain  that  had  been  placed  on  the  family  as  a   consequence  of  his  role  in  the  Civil  Rights  Movement.   She  said  her  husband  suggested  that:   When  you  are  willing  to  make  sacrifices  for  a  great  cause,  you  will  never  be  alone   because  you  will  have  divine  companionship  and  the  support  of  good  people.   That  was  her  husband's  advice  to  her        that  when  you  are  willing  to  make  sacrifices  for  a   great  cause,  you  will  never  be  alone.   Coretta  Scott  King  died  in  her  sleep  last  night.  She  certainly  was  not  alone.  She  was  joined  by   the  companionship  and  support  of  a  loving  family  and  a  grateful  Nation        inspired  by  her   cause,  dedicated  to  her  work,  and  mournful  of  her  passing.   My  thoughts,  condolences  today  are  with  her  children.   And  I  ask  that  she  and  her  husband  now  rest  together  in  eternal  peace. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.

"Chancellor Merkel and I have just finished our tour here at Buchenwald. I want to thank Dr. VolkhardKnigge, who gave an outstanding account of what we were witnessing. I am particularly grateful to beaccompanied by my friend Elie Wiesel, as well as Mr. Bertrand Herz, both of whom are survivors of thisplace. We saw the area known as Little Camp where Elie and Bertrand were sent as boys. In fact, at the place thatcommemorates this camp, there is a photograph in which we can see a 16-year-old Elie in one of the bunksalong with the others. We saw the ovens of the crematorium, the guard towers, the barbed wire fences, thefoundations of barracks that once held people in the most unimaginable conditions. We saw the memorial to all the survivors -- a steel plate, as Chancellor Merkel said, that is heated to 37degrees Celsius, the temperature of the human body; a reminder -- where people were deemed inhumanbecause of their differences -- of the mark that we all share. Now these sights have not lost their horror with the passage of time. As we were walking up, Elie said, ""ifthese trees could talk."" And there's a certain irony about the beauty of the landscape and the horror thattook place here. More than half a century later, our grief and our outrage over what happened have not diminished. I will notforget what I've seen here today. I've known about this place since I was a boy, hearing stories about my great uncle, who was a very youngman serving in World War II. He was part of the 89th Infantry Division, the first Americans to reach aconcentration camp. They liberated Ohrdruf, one of Buchenwald's sub-camps. And I told this story, he returned from his service in a state of shock saying little and isolating himself formonths on end from family and friends, alone with the painful memories that would not leave his head. Andas we see -- as we saw some of the images here, it's understandable that someone who witnessed whathad taken place here would be in a state of shock. My great uncle's commander, General Eisenhower, understood this impulse to silence. He had seen thepiles of bodies and starving survivors and deplorable conditions that the American soldiers found when theyarrived, and he knew that those who witnessed these things might be too stunned to speak about them orbe able -- be unable to find the words to describe them; that they might be rendered mute in the way mygreat uncle had. And he knew that what had happened here was so unthinkable that after the bodies hadbeen taken away, that perhaps no one would believe it. And that's why he ordered American troops and Germans from the nearby town to tour the camp. He invitedcongressmen and journalists to bear witness and ordered photographs and films to be made. And heinsisted on viewing every corner of these camps so that -- and I quote -- he could ""be in a position to givefirst-hand evidence of these things if ever in the future there develops a tendency to charge theseallegations merely to propaganda."" We are here today because we know this work is not yet finished. To this day, there are those who insistthat the Holocaust never happened -- a denial of fact and truth that is baseless and ignorant and hateful.This place is the ultimate rebuke to such thoughts; a reminder of our duty to confront those who would telllies about our history. Also to this day, there are those who perpetuate every form of intolerance -- racism, anti-Semitism,homophobia, xenophobia, sexism, and more -- hatred that degrades its victims and diminishes us all. In thiscentury, we've seen genocide. We've seen mass graves and the ashes of villages burned to the ground;children used as soldiers and rape used as a weapon of war. This places teaches us that we must be evervigilant about the spread of evil in our own time, that we must reject the false comfort that others' suffering isnot our problem and commit ourselves to resisting those who would subjugate others to serve their owninterests. But as we reflect today on the human capacity for evil and our shared obligation to defy it, we're alsoreminded of the human capacity for good. For amidst the countless acts of cruelty that took place here, weknow that there were many acts of courage and kindness, as well. The Jews who insisted on fasting on YomKippur. The camp cook who hid potatoes in the lining of his prison uniform and distributed them to his fellowinmates, risking his own life to help save theirs. The prisoners who organized a special effort to protect thechildren here, sheltering them from work and giving them extra food. They set up secret classrooms, someof the inmates, and taught history and math and urged the children to think about their future professions.And we were just hearing about the resistance that formed and the irony that the base for the resistancewas in the latrine areas because the guards found it so offensive that they wouldn't go there. And so out ofthe filth, that became a space in which small freedoms could thrive. When the American GIs arrived they were astonished to find more than 900 children still alive, and theyoungest was just three years old. And I'm told that a couple of the prisoners even wrote a Buchenwaldsong that many here sang. Among the lyrics were these: ""...whatever our fate, we will say yes to life, for the day will come when we arefree...in our blood we carry the will to live and in our hearts, in our hearts -- faith."" These individuals never could have known the world would one day speak of this place. They could nothave known that some of them would live to have children and grandchildren who would grow up hearingtheir stories and would return here so many years later to find a museum and memorials and the clock towerset permanently to 3:15, the moment of liberation. They could not have known how the nation of Israel would rise out of the destruction of the Holocaust andthe strong, enduring bonds between that great nation and my own. And they could not have known that oneday an American President would visit this place and speak of them and that he would do so standing sideby side with the German Chancellor in a Germany that is now a vibrant democracy and a valued Americanally. They could not have known these things. But still surrounded by death they willed themselves to hold fast tolife. In their hearts they still had faith that evil would not triumph in the end, that while history is unknowableit arches towards progress, and that the world would one day remember them. And it is now up to us, theliving, in our work, wherever we are, to resist injustice and intolerance and indifference in whatever formsthey may take, and ensure that those who were lost here did not go in vain. It is up to us to redeem thatfaith. It is up to us to bear witness; to ensure that the world continues to note what happened here; toremember all those who survived and all those who perished, and to remember them not just as victims, butalso as individuals who hoped and loved and dreamed just like us. And just as we identify with the victims, it's also important for us I think to remember that the perpetrators ofsuch evil were human, as well, and that we have to guard against cruelty in ourselves. And I want toexpress particular thanks to Chancellor Merkel and the German people, because it's not easy to look intothe past in this way and acknowledge it and make something of it, make a determination that they will standguard against acts like this happening again. Rather than have me end with my remarks I thought it was appropriate to have Elie Wiesel provide somereflection and some thought as he returns here so many years later to the place where his father died.",obama
"Good afternoon. Thank you, President Sarkozy, Prime Minister Brown, Prime Minister Harper,and Prince Charles for being here today. Thank you to our Secretary of Veterans Affairs,General Eric Shinseki, for making the trip out here to join us. Thanks also to SusanEisenhower, whose grandfather began this mission 65 years ago with a simple charge: ""Ok,let's go."" And to a World War II veteran who returned home from this war to serve a proudand distinguished career as a United States Senator and a national leader: Bob Dole. I'm not the first American President to come and mark this anniversary, and I likely will not bethe last. This is an event that has long brought to this coast both heads of state and gratefulcitizens; veterans and their loved ones; the liberated and their liberators. It's been writtenabout and spoken of and depicted in countless books and films and speeches. And long afterour time on this Earth has passed, one word will still bring forth the pride and awe of men andwomen who will never meet the heroes who sit before us: D-Day. Why is this? Of all the battles in all the wars across the span of human history, why does thisday hold such a revered place in our memory? What is it about the struggle that took placeon the sands a few short steps from here that brings us back to remember year after yearafter year? Part of it, I think, is the size of the odds that weighed against success. For three centuries, noinvader had ever been able to cross the English Channel into Normandy. And it had neverbeen more difficult than in 1944. That was the year that Hitler ordered his top field marshal to fortify the Atlantic Wall against aseaborne invasion. From the tip of Norway to southern France, the Nazis lined steep cliffswith machine guns and artillery. Low-lying areas were flooded to block passage. Sharpenedpoles awaited paratroopers. Mines were laid on the beaches and beneath the water. And bythe time of the invasion, half a million Germans waited for the Allies along the coast betweenHolland and northern France. At dawn on June 6th, the Allies came. The best chance for victory had been for the BritishRoyal Air Corps to take out the guns on the cliffs while airborne divisions parachuted behindenemy lines. But all did not go according to plan. Paratroopers landed miles from their mark,while the fog and clouds prevented Allied planes from destroying the guns on the cliffs. Sowhen the ships landed here at Omaha, an unimaginable hell rained down on the men inside. Many never made it out of the boats. And yet, despite all of this, one by one, the Allied forces made their way to shore -- here, andat Utah and Juno; Gold and Sword. They were American, British, and Canadian. Soon, theparatroopers found each other and fought their way back. The Rangers scaled the cliffs. Andby the end of the day, against all odds, the ground on which we stand was free once more. The sheer improbability of this victory is part of what makes D-Day so memorable. It alsoarises from the clarity of purpose with which this war was waged. We live in a world of competing beliefs and claims about what is true. It's a world of variedreligions and cultures and forms of government. In such a world, it's all too rare for astruggle to emerge that speaks to something universal about humanity. The Second World War did that. No man who shed blood or lost a brother would say that waris good. But all know that this war was essential. For what we faced in Nazi totalitarianismwas not just a battle of competing interests. It was a competing vision of humanity. Naziideology sought to subjugate and humiliate and exterminate. It perpetrated murder on amassive scale, fueled by a hatred of those who were deemed different and therefore inferior. It was evil. The nations that joined together to defeat Hitler's Reich were not perfect. They had madetheir share of mistakes, had not always agreed with one another on every issue. Butwhatever God we prayed to, whatever our differences, we knew that the evil we faced had tobe stopped. Citizens of all faiths and of no faith came to believe that we could not remain asbystanders to the savage perpetration of death and destruction. And so we joined and sentour sons to fight and often die so that men and women they never met might know what it isto be free. In America, it was an endeavor that inspired a nation to action. A President who asked hiscountry to pray on D-Day also asked its citizens to serve and sacrifice to make the invasionpossible. On farms and in factories, millions of men and women worked three shifts a day, month aftermonth, year after year. Trucks and tanks came from plants in Michigan and Indiana, NewYork and Illinois. Bombers and fighter planes rolled off assembly lines in Ohio and Kansas,where my grandmother did her part as an inspector. Shipyards on both coasts produced thelargest fleet in history, including the landing craft from New Orleans that eventually made ithere to Omaha. But despite all the years of planning and preparation, despite the inspiration of our leaders,the skill of our generals, the strength of our firepower and the unyielding support from ourhome front, the outcome of the entire struggle would ultimately rest on the success of oneday in June. Lyndon Johnson once said that there are certain moments when ""  history and fate meet at asingle time in a single place to shape a turning point in man's unending search for freedom."" D-Day was such a moment. One newspaper noted that ""we have come to the hour for whichwe were born."" Had the Allies failed here, Hitler's occupation of this continent might havecontinued indefinitely. Instead, victory here secured a foothold in France. It opened a path toBerlin. It made possible the achievements that followed the liberation of Europe: theMarshall Plan, the NATO alliance, the shared prosperity and security that flowed from each. It was unknowable then, but so much of the progress that would define the 20th century, onboth sides of the Atlantic, came down to the battle for a slice of beach only six miles long andtwo miles wide. More particularly, it came down to the men who landed here -- those who now rest in thisplace for eternity, and those who are with us here today. Perhaps more than any otherreason, you, the veterans of that landing, are why we still remember what happened on D- Day. You're why we keep coming back. For you remind us that in the end, human destiny is not determined by forces beyond ourcontrol. You remind us that our future is not shaped by mere chance or circumstance. Ourhistory has always been the sum total of the choices made and the actions taken by eachindividual man and woman. It has always been up to us. You could have done what Hitler believed you would do when you arrived here. In the face ofa merciless assault from these cliffs, you could have idled the boats offshore. Amid a barrageof tracer bullets that lit the night sky, you could have stayed in those planes. You could havehid in the hedgerows or waited behind the seawall. You could have done only what wasnecessary to ensure your own survival. But that's not what you did. That's not the story you told on D-Day. Your story was writtenby men like Zane Schlemmer of the 82nd Airborne, who parachuted into a dark marsh, farfrom his objective and his men. Lost and alone, he still managed to fight his way through the gunfire and help liberate thetown in which he landed -- a town where a street now bears his name. It's a story written by men like Anthony Ruggiero, an Army Ranger who saw half the men onhis landing craft drown when it was hit by shellfire just a thousand yards off this beach. Hespent three hours in freezing water, and was one of only 90 Rangers to survive out of the 225who were sent to scale the cliffs. And it's a story written by so many who are no longer with us, like Carlton Barrett. PrivateBarrett was only supposed to serve as a guide for the 1st Infantry Division, but he insteadbecame one of its heroes. After wading ashore in neck-deep water, he returned to the wateragain and again and again to save his wounded and drowning comrades. And under theheaviest possible enemy fire, he carried them to safety. He carried them in his own arms. This is the story of the Allied victory. It's the legend of units like Easy Company and the All- American 82nd. It's the tale of the British people, whose courage during the Blitz forced Hitlerto call off the invasion of England; the Canadians, who came even though they were neverattacked; the Russians, who sustained some of the war's heaviest casualties on the Easternfront; and all those French men and women who would rather have died resisting tyrannythan lived within its grasp. It is the memories that have been passed on to so many of us about the service or sacrifice ofa friend or relative. For me, it is my grandfather, Stanley Dunham, who arrived on this beachsix weeks after D-Day and marched across Europe in Patton's Army. And it is my great unclewho was part of the first American division to reach and liberate a Nazi concentration camp. His name is Charles Payne, and I'm so proud that he's with us here today. I know this trip doesn't get any easier as the years pass, but for those of you who make it,there's nothing that could keep you away. One such veteran, a man named Jim Norene, wasa member of the 502nd Parachute Infantry Division of the 101st Airborne. Last night, aftervisiting this cemetery for one last time, he passed away in his sleep. Jim was gravely ill whenhe left his home, and he knew that he might not return. But just as he did 65 years ago, hecame anyway. May he now rest in peace with the boys he once bled with, and may his familyalways find solace in the heroism he showed here. In the end, Jim Norene came back to Normandy for the same reason we all come back. Hecame for the reason articulated by Howard Huebner, another former paratrooper who is herewith us today. When asked why he made the trip, Howard said, ""It's important that we tellour stories. It doesn't have to be something big  just a little story about what happened -- sopeople don't forget."" So people don't forget. Friends and veterans, we cannot forget. What we must not forget is that D-Day was a timeand a place where the bravery and the selflessness of a few was able to change the course ofan entire century. At an hour of maximum danger, amid the bleakest of circumstances, menwho thought themselves ordinary found within themselves the ability to do somethingextraordinary. They fought for their moms and sweethearts back home, for the fellowwarriors they came to know as brothers. And they fought out of a simple sense of duty -- aduty sustained by the same ideals for which their countrymen had once fought and bled forover two centuries. That is the story of Normandy -- but also the story of America; of the Minutemen whogathered on a green in Lexington; of the Union boys from Maine who repelled a charge atGettysburg; of the men who gave their last full measure of devotion at Inchon and Khe San;of all the young men and women whose valor and goodness still carry forward this legacy ofservice and sacrifice. It's a story that has never come easy, but one that always gives ushope. For as we face down the hardships and struggles of our time, and arrive at that hourfor which we were born, we cannot help but draw strength from those moments in historywhen the best among us were somehow able to swallow their fears and secure a beachheadon an unforgiving shore. To those men who achieved that victory 65 years ago, we thank you for your service. May God bless you, and may God bless the memory of all those who rest here.",obama
"Good afternoon, everybody. Today I want to start by addressing three issues, and then I'lltake your questions. First, I'd like to say a few words about the situation in Iran. The United States and theinternational community have been appalled and outraged by the threats, the beatings, andimprisonments of the last few days. I strongly condemn these unjust actions, and I join withthe American people in mourning each and every innocent life that is lost. I've made it clear that the United States respects the sovereignty of the Islamic Republic ofIran, and is not interfering with Iran's affairs. But we must also bear witness to the courageand the dignity of the Iranian people, and to a remarkable opening within Iranian society. Andwe deplore the violence against innocent civilians anywhere that it takes place. The Iranian people are trying to have a debate about their future. Some in Iran -- Some in theIranian government, in particular, are trying to avoid that debate by accusing the UnitedStates and others in the West of instigating protests over the election. These accusations arepatently false. They're an obvious attempt to distract people from what is truly taking placewithin Iran's borders. This tired strategy of using old tensions to scapegoat other countrieswon't work anymore in Iran. This is not about the United States or the West; this is about thepeople of Iran, and the future that they -- and only they -- will choose. The Iranian people canspeak for themselves. That's precisely what's happened in the last few days. In 2009, no iron fist is strong enough to shut off the world from bearing witness to peacefulprotests of justice. Despite the Iranian government's efforts to expel journalists and isolateitself, powerful images and poignant words have made their way to us through cell phonesand computers, and so we've watched what the Iranian people are doing. This is what we've witnessed. We've seen the timeless dignity of tens of thousands of Iranians marching in silence. We'veseen people of all ages risk everything to insist that their votes are counted and that theirvoices are heard. Above all, we've seen courageous women stand up to the brutality andthreats, and we've experienced the searing image of a woman bleeding to death on thestreets. While this loss is raw and extraordinarily painful, we also know this: Those who standup for justice are always on the right side of history. As I said in Cairo, suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away. The Iranianpeople have a universal right to assembly and free speech. If the Iranian government seeksthe respect of the international community, it must respect those rights and heed the will ofits own people. It must govern through consent and not coercion. That's what Iran's ownpeople are calling for, and the Iranian people will ultimately judge the actions of their owngovernment.",obama
"Good morning. It is a great honor for me to join you at the New Economic School. Michelle and I are sopleased to be in Moscow. And as somebody who was born in Hawaii, I'm glad to be here in July instead ofJanuary. I know that NES is a young school, but I speak to you today with deep respect for Russia's timelessheritage. Russian writers have helped us understand the complexity of the human experience, andrecognize eternal truths. Russian painters, composers, and dancers have introduced us to new forms ofbeauty. Russian scientists have cured disease, sought new frontiers of progress, and helped us go tospace. These are contributions that are not contained by Russia's borders, as vast as those borders are. Indeed,Russia's heritage has touched every corner of the world, and speaks to the humanity that we share. Thatincludes my own country, which has been blessed with Russian immigrants for decades; we've beenenriched by Russian culture, and enhanced by Russian cooperation. And as a resident of Washington, D.C.,I continue to benefit from the contributions of Russians -- specifically, from Alexander Ovechkin. We're verypleased to have him in Washington, D.C. Here at NES, you have inherited this great cultural legacy, but your focus on economics is no lessfundamental to the future of humanity. As Pushkin said, ""Inspiration is needed in geometry just as much aspoetry."" And today, I want particularly to speak to those of you preparing to graduate. You're poised to beleaders in academia and industry; in finance and government. But before you move forward, it's worthreflecting on what has already taken place during your young lives. Like President Medvedev and myself, you're not old enough to have witnessed the darkest hours of theCold War, when hydrogen bombs were tested in the atmosphere, and children drilled in fallout shelters, andwe reached the brink of nuclear catastrophe. But you are the last generation born when the world wasdivided. At that time, the American and Soviet armies were still massed in Europe, trained and ready tofight. The ideological trenches of the last century were roughly in place. Competition in everything fromastrophysics to athletics was treated as a zero-sum game. If one person won, then the other person had tolose. And then, within a few short years, the world as it was ceased to be. Now, make no mistake: This changedid not come from any one nation. The Cold War reached a conclusion because of the actions of manynations over many years, and because the people of Russia and Eastern Europe stood up and decided thatits end would be peaceful. With the end of the Cold War, there were extraordinary expectations -- for peace and for prosperity; for newarrangements among nations, and new opportunities for individuals. Like all periods of great change, it wasa time of ambitious plans and endless possibilities. But, of course, things don't always work out exactly asplanned. Back in 1993, shortly after this school opened, one NES student summed up the difficulty ofchange when he told a reporter, and I quote him: ""The real world is not so rational as on paper."" The realworld is not so rational as on paper. Over two tumultuous decades, that truth has been borne out around the world. Great wealth has beencreated, but it has not eliminated vast pockets of crushing poverty. Poverty exists here, it exists in the UnitedStates, and it exists all around the world. More people have gone to the ballot box, but too manygovernments still fail to protect the rights of their people. Ideological struggles have diminished, but they'vebeen replaced by conflicts over tribe and ethnicity and religion. A human being with a computer can hold thesame amount of information stored in the Russian State Library, but that technology can also be used to dogreat harm. In a new Russia, the disappearance of old political and economic restrictions after the end of the SovietUnion brought both opportunity and hardship. A few prospered, but many more did not. There were toughtimes. But the Russian people showed strength and made sacrifices, and you achieved hard-earnedprogress through a growing economy and greater confidence. And despite painful times, many in EasternEurope and Russia are much better off today than 20 years ago. We see that progress here at NES -- a school founded with Western support that is now distinctly Russian;a place of learning and inquiry where the test of an idea is not whether it is Russian or American orEuropean, but whether it works. Above all, we see that progress in all of you -- young people with a youngcentury to shape as you see fit. Your lifetime coincides with this era of transition. But think about the fundamental questions asked when thisschool was founded. What kind of future is Russia going to have? What kind of future are Russia andAmerica going to have together? What world order will replace the Cold War? Those questions still don'thave clear answers, and so now they must be answered by you -- by your generation in Russia, in America,and around the world. You get to decide. And while I cannot answer those questions for you, I can speakplainly about the future that America is seeking. To begin with, let me be clear: America wants a strong, peaceful, and prosperous Russia. This belief isrooted in our respect for the Russian people, and a shared history between our nations that goes beyondcompetition. Despite our past rivalry, our people were allies in the greatest struggle of the last century.Recently, I noted this when I was in Normandy -- for just as men from Boston and Birmingham risked all thatthey had to storm those beaches and scale those cliffs, Soviet soldiers from places like Kazan and Kievendured unimaginable hardships to repeal -- to repel an invasion, and turn the tide in the east. As PresidentJohn Kennedy said, ""No nation in history of battle ever suffered more than the Soviet Union in the SecondWorld War."" So as we honor this past, we also recognize the future benefit that will come from a strong and vibrantRussia. Think of the issues that will define your lives: security from nuclear weapons and extremism; accessto markets and opportunity; health and the environment; an international system that protects sovereigntyand human rights, while promoting stability and prosperity. These challenges demand global partnership,and that partnership will be stronger if Russia occupies its rightful place as a great power. Yet unfortunately, there is sometimes a sense that old assumptions must prevail, old ways of thinking; aconception of power that is rooted in the past rather than in the future. There is the 20th century view thatthe United States and Russia are destined to be antagonists, and that a strong Russia or a strong Americacan only assert themselves in opposition to one another. And there is a 19th century view that we aredestined to vie for spheres of influence, and that great powers must forge competing blocs to balance oneanother. These assumptions are wrong. In 2009, a great power does not show strength by dominating or demonizingother countries. The days when empires could treat sovereign states as pieces on a chess board are over.As I said in Cairo, given our independence, any world order that -- given our interdependence, any worldorder that tries to elevate one nation or one group of people over another will inevitably fail. The pursuit ofpower is no longer a zero-sum game -- progress must be shared. That's why I have called for a ""reset"" in relations between the United States and Russia. This must be morethan a fresh start between the Kremlin and the White House -- though that is important and I've hadexcellent discussions with both your President and your Prime Minister. It must be a sustained effort amongthe American and Russian people to identify mutual interests, and expand dialogue and cooperation thatcan pave the way to progress. This will not be easy. It's difficult to forge a lasting partnership between former adversaries, it's hard tochange habits that have been ingrained in our governments and our bureaucracies for decades. But Ibelieve that on the fundamental issues that will shape this century, Americans and Russians share commoninterests that form a basis for cooperation. It is not for me to define Russia's national interests, but I can tellyou about America's national interests, and I believe that you will see that we share common ground. First, America has an interest in reversing the spread of nuclear weapons and preventing their use. In the last century, generations of Americans and Russians inherited the power to destroy nations, and theunderstanding that using that power would bring about our own destruction. In 2009, our inheritance isdifferent. You and I don't have to ask whether American and Russian leaders will respect a balance of terror-- we understand the horrific consequences of any war between our two countries. But we do have to askthis question: We have to ask whether extremists who have killed innocent civilians in New York and inMoscow will show that same restraint. We have to ask whether 10 or 20 or 50 nuclear-armed nations willprotect their arsenals and refrain from using them. This is the core of the nuclear challenge in the 21st century. The notion that prestige comes from holdingthese weapons, or that we can protect ourselves by picking and choosing which nations can have theseweapons, is an illusion. In the short period since the end of the Cold War, we've already seen India,Pakistan, and North Korea conduct nuclear tests. Without a fundamental change, do any of us truly believethat the next two decades will not bring about the further spread of these nuclear weapons? That's why America is committed to stopping nuclear proliferation, and ultimately seeking a world withoutnuclear weapons. That is consistent with our commitment under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Thatis our responsibility as the world's two leading nuclear powers. And while I know this goal won't be metsoon, pursuing it provides the legal and moral foundation to prevent the proliferation and eventual use ofnuclear weapons. We're already taking important steps to build this foundation. Yesterday, President Medvedev and I madeprogress on negotiating a new treaty that will substantially reduce our warheads and delivery systems. Werenewed our commitment to clean, safe and peaceful nuclear energy, which must be a right for all nationsthat live up to their responsibilities under the NPT. And we agreed to increase cooperation on nuclearsecurity, which is essential to achieving the goal of securing all vulnerable nuclear material within four years. As we keep our own commitments, we must hold other nations accountable for theirs. Whether America orRussia, neither of us would benefit from a nuclear arms race in East Asia or the Middle East. That's why weshould be united in opposing North Korea's efforts to become a nuclear power, and opposing Iran's effortsto acquire a nuclear weapon. And I'm pleased that President Medvedev and I agreed upon a joint threatassessment of the ballistic challenges -- ballistic missile challenges of the 21st century, including from Iranand North Korea. This is not about singling out individual nations -- it's about the responsibilities of all nations. If we fail tostand together, then the NPT and the Security Council will lose credibility, and international law will give wayto the law of the jungle. And that benefits no one. As I said in Prague, rules must be binding, violations mustbe punished, and words must mean something. The successful enforcement of these rules will remove causes of disagreement. I know Russia opposes theplanned configuration for missile defense in Europe. And my administration is reviewing these plans toenhance the security of America, Europe and the world. And I've made it clear that this system is directed atpreventing a potential attack from Iran. It has nothing to do with Russia. In fact, I want to work together withRussia on a missile defense architecture that makes us all safer. But if the threat from Iran's nuclear andballistic missile program is eliminated, the driving force for missile defense in Europe will be eliminated, andthat is in our mutual interests. Now, in addition to securing the world's most dangerous weapons, a second area where America has acritical national interest is in isolating and defeating violent extremists. For years, al Qaeda and its affiliates have defiled a great religion of peace and justice, and ruthlesslymurdered men, women and children of all nationalities and faiths. Indeed, above all, they have murderedMuslims. And these extremists have killed in Amman and Bali; Islamabad and Kabul; and they have theblood of Americans and Russians on their hands. They're plotting to kill more of our people, and they benefitfrom safe havens that allow them to train and operate -- particularly along the border of Pakistan andAfghanistan. And that's why America has a clear goal: to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda and its allies inAfghanistan and Pakistan. We seek no bases, nor do we want to control these nations. Instead, we want towork with international partners, including Russia, to help Afghans and Pakistanis advance their ownsecurity and prosperity. And that's why I'm pleased that Russia has agreed to allow the United States tosupply our coalition forces through your territory. Neither America nor Russia has an interest in anAfghanistan or Pakistan governed by the Taliban. It's time to work together on behalf of a different future -- afuture in which we leave behind the great game of the past and the conflict of the present; a future in whichall of us contribute to the security of Central Asia. Now, beyond Afghanistan, America is committed to promoting the opportunity that will isolate extremists.We are helping the Iraqi people build a better future, and leaving Iraq to the Iraqis. We're pursuing the goalof two states, Israel and Palestine, living in peace and security. We're partnering with Muslim communitiesaround the world to advance education, health, and economic development. In each of these endeavors, Ibelieve that the Russian people share our goals, and will benefit from success -- and we need to partnertogether. Now, in addition to these security concerns, the third area that I will discuss is America's interest in globalprosperity. And since we have so many economists and future businessmen and women in the room, I knowthis is of great interest to you. We meet in the midst of the worst global recession in a generation. I believe that the free market is thegreatest force for creating and distributing wealth that the world has known. But wherever the market isallowed to run rampant -- through excessive risk-taking, a lack of regulation, or corruption -- then all areendangered, whether we live on the Mississippi or on the Volga. In America, we're now taking unprecedented steps to jumpstart our economy and reform our system ofregulation. But just as no nation can wall itself off from the consequences of a global crisis, no one canserve as the sole engine of global growth. You see, during your lives, something fundamental has changed.And while this crisis has shown us the risks that come with change, that risk is overwhelmed by opportunity. Think of what's possible today that was unthinkable two decades ago. A young woman with an Internetconnection in Bangalore, India can compete with anybody anywhere in the world. An entrepreneur with astart-up company in Beijing can take his business global. An NES professor in Moscow can collaborate withcolleagues at Harvard or Stanford. That's good for all of us, because when prosperity is created in India,that's a new market for our goods; when new ideas take hold in China, that pushes our businesses toinnovate; when new connections are forged among people, all of us are enriched. There is extraordinary potential for increased cooperation between Americans and Russians. We canpursue trade that is free and fair and integrated with the wider world. We can boost investment that createsjobs in both our countries, we can forge partnerships on energy that tap not only traditional resources, likeoil and gas, but new sources of energy that will drive growth and combat climate change. All of that,Americans and Russians can do together. Now, government can promote this cooperation, but ultimately individuals must advance this cooperation,because the greatest resource of any nation in the 21st century is you. It's people; it's young peopleespecially. And the country which taps that resource will be the country that will succeed. That successdepends upon economies that function within the rule of law. As President Medvedev has rightly said, amature and effective legal system is a condition for sustained economic development. People everywhereshould have the right to do business or get an education without paying a bribe. Whether they are inAmerica or Russia or Africa or Latin America, that's not a American idea or a Russian idea -- that's howpeople and countries will succeed in the 21st century. And this brings me to the fourth issue that I will discuss -- America's interest in democratic governments thatprotect the rights of their people. By no means is America perfect. But it is our commitment to certain universal values which allows us tocorrect our imperfections, to improve constantly, and to grow stronger over time. Freedom of speech andassembly has allowed women, and minorities, and workers to protest for full and equal rights at a time whenthey were denied. The rule of law and equal administration of justice has busted monopolies, shut downpolitical machines that were corrupt, ended abuses of power. Independent media have exposed corruptionat all levels of business and government. Competitive elections allow us to change course and hold ourleaders accountable. If our democracy did not advance those rights, then I, as a person of African ancestry,wouldn't be able to address you as an American citizen, much less a President. Because at the time of ourfounding, I had no rights -- people who looked like me. But it is because of that process that I can now standbefore you as President of the United States. So around the world, America supports these values because they are moral, but also because they work.The arc of history shows that governments which serve their own people survive and thrive; governmentswhich serve only their own power do not. Governments that represent the will of their people are far lesslikely to descend into failed states, to terrorize their citizens, or to wage war on others. Governments thatpromote the rule of law, subject their actions to oversight, and allow for independent institutions are moredependable trading partners. And in our own history, democracies have been America's most enduringallies, including those we once waged war with in Europe and Asia -- nations that today live with greatsecurity and prosperity. Now let me be clear: America cannot and should not seek to impose any system of government on anyother country, nor would we presume to choose which party or individual should run a country. And wehaven't always done what we should have on that front. Even as we meet here today, America supportsnow the restoration of the democratically-elected President of Honduras, even though he has stronglyopposed American policies. We do so not because we agree with him. We do so because we respect theuniversal principle that people should choose their own leaders, whether they are leaders we agree with ornot. And that leads me to the final area that I will discuss, which is America's interest in an international systemthat advances cooperation while respecting the sovereignty of all nations. State sovereignty must be a cornerstone of international order. Just as all states should have the right tochoose their leaders, states must have the right to borders that are secure, and to their own foreign policies.That is true for Russia, just as it is true for the United States. Any system that cedes those rights will lead toanarchy. That's why we must apply this principle to all nations -- and that includes nations like Georgia andUkraine. America will never impose a security arrangement on another country. For any country to becomea member of an organization like NATO, for example, a majority of its people must choose to; they mustundertake reforms; they must be able to contribute to the Alliance's mission. And let me be clear: NATOshould be seeking collaboration with Russia, not confrontation. And more broadly, we need to foster cooperation and respect among all nations and peoples. As Presidentof the United States, I will work tirelessly to protect America's security and to advance our interests. But noone nation can meet the challenges of the 21st century on its own, nor dictate its terms to the world. That issomething that America now understands, just as Russia understands. That's why America seeks aninternational system that lets nations pursue their interests peacefully, especially when those interestsdiverge; a system where the universal rights of human beings are respected, and violations of those rightsare opposed; a system where we hold ourselves to the same standards that we apply to other nations, withclear rights and responsibilities for all. There was a time when Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin could shape the world in one meeting. Those daysare over. The world is more complex today. Billions of people have found their voice, and seek their ownmeasure of prosperity and self-determination in every corner of the planet. Over the past two decades,we've witnessed markets grow, wealth spread, and technology used to build -- not destroy. We've seen oldhatreds pass, illusions of differences between people lift and fade away; we've seen the human destiny inthe hands of more and more human beings who can shape their own destinies. Now, we must see that theperiod of transition which you have lived through ushers in a new era in which nations live in peace, andpeople realize their aspirations for dignity, security, and a better life for their children. That is America'sinterest, and I believe that it is Russia's interest as well. I know that this future can seem distant. Change is hard. In the words of that NES student back in 1993, thereal world is not so rational as on paper. But think of the change that has unfolded with the passing of time.One hundred years ago, a czar ruled Russia, and Europe was a place of empire. When I was born,segregation was still the law of the land in parts of America, and my father's Kenya was still a colony. Whenyou were born, a school like this would have been impossible, and the Internet was only known to aprivileged few. You get to decide what comes next. You get to choose where change will take us, because the future doesnot belong to those who gather armies on a field of battle or bury missiles in the ground; the future belongsto young people with an education and the imagination to create. That is the source of power in this century.And given all that has happened in your two decades on Earth, just imagine what you can create in theyears to come. Every country charts its own course. Russia has cut its way through time like a mighty river through acanyon, leaving an indelible mark on human history as it goes. As you move this story forward, look to thefuture that can be built if we refuse to be burdened by the old obstacles and old suspicions; look to thefuture that can be built if we partner on behalf of the aspirations we hold in common. Together, we can builda world where people are protected, prosperity is enlarged, and our power truly serves progress. And it is allin your hands. Good luck to all of you. Thank you very much.",obama
"I like this. Thank you. Thank you. I think Congress needs one of those horns. That soundspretty good. Sounds like Louis Armstrong back there. Good afternoon, everybody. It is a great honor for me to be in Accra and to speak to the representatives of the people of Ghana. I am deeply grateful for the welcome that I've received, as are Michelle and Malia and Sasha Obama. Ghana's history is rich, the ties between our two countries are strong, and I am proud that this is my first visit to sub- Saharan Africa as President of the United States of America. I want to thank Madam Speaker and all the members of the House of Representatives for hosting us today. I want to thank President Mills for his outstanding leadership. To the former Presidents -- Jerry Rawlings, former President Kufuor -- Vice President, Chief Justice -- thanks to all of you for your extraordinary hospitality and the wonderful institutions that you've builthere in Ghana. I'm speaking to you at the end of a long trip. I began in Russia for a summit between two great powers. I traveled to Italy for a meeting of the world's leading economies. And I've come here to Ghana for a simple reason: The 21st century will be shaped by what happensnot just in Rome or Moscow or Washington, but by what happens in Accra, as well. This is the simple truth of a time when the boundaries between people are overwhelmed by our connections. Your prosperity can expand America's prosperity. Your health and security can contribute to the world's health and security. And the strength of your democracy canhelp advance human rights for people everywhere. So I do not see the countries and peoples of Africa as a world apart; I see Africa as a fundamental part of our interconnected world -- as partners with America on behalf of the future we want for all of our children. That partnership must be grounded in mutualresponsibility and mutual respect. And that is what I want to speak with you about today. We must start from the simple premise that Africa's future is up to Africans. I say this knowing full well the tragic past that has sometimes haunted this part of the world. After all, I have the blood of Africa within me, and my family's -- my family's own storyencompasses both the tragedies and triumphs of the larger African story. Some you know my grandfather was a cook for the British in Kenya, and though he was a respected elder in his village, his employers called him ""boy"" for much of his life. He was on the periphery of Kenya's liberation struggles, but he was still imprisoned briefly during repressive times. In his life, colonialism wasn't simply the creation of unnatural borders or unfair terms of trade -- it was something experienced personally, day after day, year afteryear. My father grew up herding goats in a tiny village, an impossible distance away from the American universities where he would come to get an education. He came of age at a moment of extraordinary promise for Africa. The struggles of his own father's generation were giving birth to new nations, beginning right here in Ghana. Africans were educating and assertingthemselves in new ways, and history was on the move. But despite the progress that has been made -- and there has been considerable progress in many parts of Africa -- we also know that much of that promise has yet to be fulfilled. Countries like Kenya had a per capita economy larger than South Korea's when I was born. They have badly been outpaced. Disease and conflict have ravaged parts of the Africancontinent. In many places, the hope of my father's generation gave way to cynicism, even despair. Now, it's easy to point fingers and to pin the blame of these problems on others. Yes, a colonial map that made little sense helped to breed conflict. The West has often approached Africa as a patron or a source of resources rather than a partner. But the West is not responsible for the destruction of the Zimbabwean economy over the last decade, or wars in which children are enlisted as combatants. In my father's life, it was partly tribalism and patronage and nepotism in an independent Kenya that for a long stretch derailed his career, and we knowthat this kind of corruption is still a daily fact of life for far too many. Now, we know that's also not the whole story. Here in Ghana, you show us a face of Africa that is too often overlooked by a world that sees only tragedy or a need for charity. The people of Ghana have worked hard to put democracy on a firmer footing, with repeated peaceful transfers of power even in the wake of closely contested elections. And by the way, can I say that for that the minority deserves as much credit as the majority. And with improved governance and an emerging civil society, Ghana's economy has shown impressiverates of growth. This progress may lack the drama of 20th century liberation struggles, but make no mistake: It will ultimately be more significant. For just as it is important to emerge from thecontrol of other nations, it is even more important to build one's own nation. So I believe that this moment is just as promising for Ghana and for Africa as the moment when my father came of age and new nations were being born. This is a new moment of great promise. Only this time, we've learned that it will not be giants like Nkrumah and Kenyatta who will determine Africa's future. Instead, it will be you -- the men and women in Ghana's parliament -- the people you represent. It will be the young people brimming with talent and energy and hope who can claim the future that so many in previous generations neverrealized. Now, to realize that promise, we must first recognize the fundamental truth that you have given life to in Ghana: Development depends on good governance. That is the ingredient which has been missing in far too many places, for far too long. That's the change that canunlock Africa's potential. And that is a responsibility that can only be met by Africans. As for America and the West, our commitment must be measured by more than just the dollars we spend. I've pledged substantial increases in our foreign assistance, which is in Africa's interests and America's interests. But the true sign of success is not whether we are a source of perpetual aid that helps people scrape by -- it's whether we are partners in buildingthe capacity for transformational change. This mutual responsibility must be the foundation of our partnership. And today, I'll focus on four areas that are critical to the future of Africa and the entire developing world: democracy,opportunity, health, and the peaceful resolution of conflict. First, we must support strong and sustainable democratic governments. As I -- As I said in Cairo, each nation gives life to democracy in its own way, and in line with its own traditions. But history offers a clear verdict: Governments that respect the will of their own people, that govern by consent and not coercion, are more -- more prosperous, they aremore stable, and more successful than governments that do not. This is about more than just holding elections. It's also about what happens between elections. Repression can take many forms, and too many nations, even those that have elections, are plagued by problems that condemn their people to poverty. No country is going to create wealth if its leaders exploit the economy to enrich themselves -- or -- or if police -- if police can be bought off by drug traffickers. No business -- No business wants to invest in a place where the government skims 20 percent off the top -- or the head of the Port Authority is corrupt. No person wants to live in a society where the rule of law gives way to the rule of brutality and bribery. That is not democracy, that is tyranny, even if occasionally you sprinklean election in there. And now is the time for that style of governance to end. In the 21st century, capable, reliable, and transparent institutions are the key to success -- strong parliaments; honest police forces; independent judges; an independent press; a vibrant private sector; a civil society. Those are the things that give life to democracy,because that is what matters in people's everyday lives. Now, time and again, Ghanaians have chosen constitutional rule over autocracy, and shown a democratic spirit that allows the energy of your people to break through. We see that in leaders who accept defeat graciously -- the fact that President Mills' opponents were standing beside him last night to greet me when I came off the plane spoke volumes about Ghana; victors who resist calls to wield power against the opposition in unfair ways. We see that spirit in courageous journalists like Anas Aremeyaw Anas, who risked his life to report the truth. We see it in police like Patience Quaye, who helped prosecute the first human trafficker in Ghana. We see it in the young people who are speaking up against patronage, andparticipating in the political process. Across Africa, we've seen countless examples of people taking control of their destiny, and making change from the bottom up. We saw it in Kenya, where civil society and business came together to help stop post-election violence. We saw it in South Africa, where over three-quarters of the country voted in the recent election -- the fourth since the end of Apartheid. We saw it in Zimbabwe, where the Election Support Network braved brutalrepression to stand up for the principle that a person's vote is their sacred right. Now, make no mistake: History is on the side of these brave Africans, not with those who use coups or change constitutions to stay in power. Africa -- Africa doesn't need strongmen; itneeds strong institutions. Now, America will not seek to impose any system of government on any other nation. The essential truth of democracy is that each nation determines its own destiny. But what America will do is increase assistance for responsible individuals and responsible institutions, with a focus on supporting good governance -- on parliaments, which check abuses of power and ensure that opposition voices are heard; on the rule of law, which ensures the equal administration of justice; on civic participation, so that young people get involved; and on concrete solutions to corruption like forensic accounting and automating services -- strengthening hotlines, protecting whistle-blowers to advance transparency andaccountability. And we provide this support. I have directed my Administration to give greater attention to corruption in our human rights reports. People everywhere should have the right to start a business or get an education without paying a bribe. We have a responsibility to support those who act responsibly and to isolate those who don't, and that is exactly what America willdo. Now, this leads directly to our second area of partnership: supporting development thatprovides opportunity for more people. With better governance, I have no doubt that Africa holds the promise of a broader base of prosperity. Witness the extraordinary success of Africans in my country, America. They're doing very well. So they've got the talent, they've got the entrepreneurial spirit. The question is, how do we make sure that they're succeeding here in their home countries? The continent is rich in natural resources. And from cell phone entrepreneurs to small farmers, Africans have shown the capacity and commitment to create their own opportunities. But old habits must also be broken. Dependence on commodities -- or a single export -- has a tendency toconcentrate wealth in the hands of the few, and leaves people too vulnerable to downturns. So in Ghana, for instance, oil brings great opportunities, and you have been very responsible in preparing for new revenue. But as so many Ghanaians know, oil cannot simply become the new cocoa. From South Korea to Singapore, history shows that countries thrive when they invest in their people and in their infrastructure; when they promote multiple export industries, develop a skilled workforce, and create space for small and medium-sizedbusinesses that create jobs. As Africans reach for this promise, America will be more responsible in extending our hand. By cutting costs that go to Western consultants and administration, we want to put more resources in the hands of those who need it, while training people to do more for themselves. That's why our 3.5 billion dollar food security initiative is focused on new methods and technologies for farmers -- not simply sending American producers or goods to Africa. Aid is not an end in itself. The purpose of foreign assistance must be creating the conditions where it's no longer needed. I want to see Ghanaians not only self-sufficient infood, I want to see you exporting food to other countries and earning money. You can do that. Now, America can also do more to promote trade and investment. Wealthy nations must open our doors to goods and services from Africa in a meaningful way. That will be a commitment of my Administration. And where there is good governance, we can broaden prosperity through public-private partnerships that invest in better roads and electricity; capacity- building that trains people to grow a business; financial services that reach not just the cities but also the poor and rural areas. This is also in our own interests -- for if people are lifted out of poverty and wealth is created in Africa, guess what? New markets will open up for our owngoods. So it's good for both. One area that holds out both undeniable peril and extraordinary promise is energy. Africa gives off less greenhouse gas than any other part of the world, but it is the most threatened by climate change. A warming planet will spread disease, shrink water resources, and deplete crops, creating conditions that produce more famine and more conflict. All of us -- particularly the developed world -- have a responsibility to slow these trends -- through mitigation, and by changing the way that we use energy. But we can also work with Africans to turn this crisisinto opportunity. Together, we can partner on behalf of our planet and prosperity, and help countries increase access to power while skipping -- leapfrogging the dirtier phase of development. Think about it: Across Africa, there is bountiful wind and solar power; geothermal energy and biofuels. From the Rift Valley to the North African deserts; from the Western coasts to South Africa's crops -- Africa's boundless natural gifts can generate its own power, while exportingprofitable, clean energy abroad. These steps are about more than growth numbers on a balance sheet. They're about whether a young person with an education can get a job that supports a family; a farmer can transfer their goods to market; an entrepreneur with a good idea can start a business. It's about thedignity of work; it's about the opportunity that must exist for Africans in the 21st century. Just as governance is vital to opportunity, it's also critical to the third area I want to talkabout: strengthening public health. In recent years, enormous progress has been made in parts of Africa. Far more people are living productively with HIV/AIDS, and getting the drugs they need. I just saw a wonderful clinic and hospital that is focused particularly on maternal health. But too many still die from diseases that shouldn't kill them. When children are being killed because of a mosquito bite,and mothers are dying in childbirth, then we know that more progress must be made. Yet because of incentives -- often provided by donor nations -- many African doctors and nurses go overseas, or work for programs that focus on a single disease. And this creates gaps in primary care and basic prevention. Meanwhile, individual Africans also have to make responsible choices that prevent the spread of disease, while promoting public health in theircommunities and countries. So across Africa, we see examples of people tackling these problems. In Nigeria, an Interfaith effort of Christians and Muslims has set an example of cooperation to confront malaria. Here in Ghana and across Africa, we see innovative ideas for filling gaps in care -- for instance,through E-Health initiatives that allow doctors in big cities to support those in small towns. America will support these efforts through a comprehensive, global health strategy, because in the 21st century, we are called to act by our conscience but also by our common interest, because when a child dies of a preventable disease in Accra, that diminishes us everywhere. And when disease goes unchecked in any corner of the world, we know that itcan spread across oceans and continents. And that's why my Administration has committed 63 billion dollars to meet these challenges -- 63 billion dollars. Building on the strong efforts of President Bush, we will carry forward the fight against HIV/AIDS. We will pursue the goal of ending deaths from malaria and tuberculosis, and we will work to eradicate polio. We will fight -- we will fight neglected tropical disease. And we won't confront illnesses in isolation -- we will invest in public healthsystems that promote wellness and focus on the health of mothers and children. Now, as we partner on behalf of a healthier future, we must also stop the destruction that comes not from illness, but from human beings -- and so the final area that I will address isconflict. Let me be clear: Africa is not the crude caricature of a continent at perpetual war. But if we are honest, for far too many Africans, conflict is a part of life, as constant as the sun. There are wars over land and wars over resources. And it is still far too easy for those withoutconscience to manipulate whole communities into fighting among faiths and tribes. These conflicts are a millstone around Africa's neck. Now, we all have many identities -- of tribe and ethnicity; of religion and nationality. But defining oneself in opposition to someone who belongs to a different tribe, or who worships a different prophet, has no place in the 21st century. Africa's diversity should be a source of strength, not a cause for division. We are all God's children. We all share common aspirations -- to live in peace and security; to access education and opportunity; to love our families and our communities and our faith. That is ourcommon humanity. That is why we must stand up to inhumanity in our midst. It is never justified -- never justifiable to target innocents in the name of ideology. It is the death sentence of a society to force children to kill in wars. It is the ultimate mark of criminality and cowardice to condemn women to relentless and systemic rape. We must bear witness to the value of every child in Darfur and the dignity of every woman in the Congo. No faith or culture should condone the outrages against them. And all of us must strive for the peace and security necessary forprogress. Africans are standing up for this future. Here, too, in Ghana we are seeing you help point the way forward. Ghanaians should take pride in your contributions to peacekeeping from Congo to Liberia to Lebanon -- and your efforts to resist the scourge of the drug trade. We welcome the steps that are being taken by organizations like the African Union and ECOWAS to better resolve conflicts, to keep the peace, and support those in need. And we encourage the vision of a strong, regional security architecture that can bring effective, transnational forces to bearwhen needed. America has a responsibility to work with you as a partner to advance this vision, not just with words, but with support that strengthens African capacity. When there's a genocide in Darfur or terrorists in Somalia, these are not simply African problems -- they are global securitychallenges, and they demand a global response. And that's why we stand ready to partner through diplomacy and technical assistance and logistical support, and we will stand behind efforts to hold war criminals accountable. And let me be clear: Our Africa Command is focused not on establishing a foothold in the continent, but on confronting these common challenges to advance the security of America, Africa, andthe world. In Moscow, I spoke of the need for an international system where the universal rights of human beings are respected, and violations of those rights are opposed. And that must include a commitment to support those who resolve conflicts peacefully, to sanction and stop those who don't, and to help those who have suffered. But ultimately, it will be vibrant democracies like Botswana and Ghana which roll back the causes of conflict and advance thefrontiers of peace and prosperity. As I said earlier, Africa's future is up to Africans. The people of Africa are ready to claim that future. And in my country, African Americans -- including so many recent immigrants -- have thrived in every sector of society. We've done so despite a difficult past, and we've drawn strength from our African heritage. With strong institutions and a strong will, I know that Africans can live their dreams in Nairobi and Lagos,Kigali, Kinshasa, Harare, and right here in Accra. You know, 52 years ago, the eyes of the world were on Ghana. And a young preacher named Martin Luther King traveled here, to Accra, to watch the Union Jack come down and the Ghanaian flag go up. This was before the march on Washington or the success of the civil rights movement in my country. Dr. King was asked how he felt while watching the birth of anation. And he said: ""It renews my conviction in the ultimate triumph of justice.""1 Now that triumph must be won once more, and it must be won by you. And I am particularly speaking to the young people all across Africa and right here in Ghana. In places like Ghana,young people make up over half of the population. And here is what you must know: The world will be what you make of it. You have the power to hold your leaders accountable, and to build institutions that serve the people. You can serve in your communities, and harness your energy and education to create new wealth and build new connections to the world. You can conquer disease, and end conflicts, and make change from the bottom up. You can dothat. Yes you can -- because in this moment, history is on the move. But these things can only be done if all of you take responsibility for your future. And it won't be easy. It will take time and effort. There will be suffering and setbacks. But I can promise you this: America will be with you every step of the way -- as a partner, as a friend. Opportunity won't come from any other place, though. It must come from thedecisions that all of you make, the things that you do, the hope that you hold in your heart. Ghana, freedom is your inheritance. Now, it is your responsibility to build upon freedom's foundation. And if you do, we will look back years from now to places like Accra and say this was the time when the promise was realized; this was the moment when prosperity was forged, when pain was overcome, and a new era of progress began. This can be the time when we witness the triumph of justice once more. Yes we can. Thank you very much. God bless you. Thank you. 1 King, M.L. (1957). Interview by Etta Moten Barnett.

"Mr. President, I rise today both humbled and honored by the opportunity to express mysupport for renewal of the expiring provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. I want to thank the many people inside and outside Congress who have worked so hard overthe past year to get us here. We owe a great debt of gratitude to the leadership on both sidesof the aisle. And we owe special thanks to Chairmen Sensenbrenner and Specter, RankingMembers Conyers and Leahy, and Representative Mel Watt. Without their work anddedication, and the support of voting rights advocates across the country, I doubt that this billwould have come before us so soon. I want to thank both Chambers and both sides of the aisle, as well, for getting this done withthe same broad support that drove the original act 40 years ago. At a time when Americansare frustrated with the partisan bickering that too often stalls our work, the refreshing displayof bipartisanship we're seeing today reflects our collective belief in the success of the act andreminds us of how effective we can be when we work together. Nobody can deny that we've come a long way since 1965. Look at the registration numbers.Only two years after the passage of the original Act, registration numbers for minority votersin some States doubled. Soon after, not a single State covered by the Voting Rights Act hadregistered less than half of its minority voting age population. Look at the influence of African-American elected officials at every single level of government.There are African-American Members of Congress. Since 2001, our Nation's top diplomat1 hasbeen African American. In fact, most of America's elected African-American officials comefrom States covered by section 5 of the Voting Rights Act -- States like Mississippi, andAlabama, Louisiana, and Georgia. But to me, the most striking evidence of our progress can be found right across this buildingin my dear friend Congressman John Lewis, who was on the front lines of the Civil RightsMovement, risking life and limb for freedom. And on March 7th, 1965, he led 600 peacefulprotesters, demanding the right to vote, across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama.Now, I've often thought about the people on the Edmund Pettus Bridge that day, not onlyJohn Lewis and Hosea Williams, who led the march, but the hundreds of everyday Americanswho left their homes and their churches to join it -- Blacks and Whites, teenagers, children,teachers, bankers, shopkeepers -- what Dr. King called a beloved community of God's childrenready to stand for freedom. And I wonder sometimes -- Where did they find that kind of courage? You know, when you'refacing row after row of State troopers on horseback, armed with billy clubs and tear gas --when they're coming toward you spewing hatred and violence, how do you simply stop, kneeldown, and pray to the Lord for salvation? But the most amazing thing of all is that after that day, after John Lewis was beaten within aninch of his life, after people's heads were gashed open and their eyes were burned, and theywatched their children's innocence literally beaten out of them -- after all that, they went backand marched again. They marched again. They crossed the bridge. They awakened a nation'sconscience. And not five months later the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was signed into law. Itwas reauthorized in 1970, in 1975, and 1982. Now, in 2006 John Lewis, the physical scars of those marches still visible, is an originalcosponsor of the fourth reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act. And he was joined last weekby 389 of his House colleagues in voting for its passage. There were some in the House, and there may be some in the Senate, who argue that the Actis no longer needed, that the protections of section 5's ""preclearance'' requirement"" -- arequirement that ensures certain States are upholding the right to vote -- are targeting thewrong States. Unfortunately, the evidence refutes that notion. Of the 1100 objections issuedby the Department of Justice since 1965, 56 [percent] occurred since the last reauthorizationin 1982. Over half have occurred since 1982. So despite the progress these States have madein upholding the right to vote, it's clear that problems still exist. Now, there are others who would argue that we shouldn't renew section 203's protection oflanguage minorities. These arguments have been tied to debates over immigration and theytend to muddle a noncontroversial issue -- protecting the right to vote -- with one of today'smost contentious debates. But let's remember, you can't request language assistance if you'renot a voter. And you can't be a voter if you are not a citizen. And while voters, as citizens,must be proficient in English, many are simply more confident that they can cast ballotsprinted in their native languages without making errors. It's not an unreasonable assumption. A representative of the Southwestern Voter Registration Project is quoted as saying, (quote): Citizens who prefer Spanish registration cards do so because they feel more connectedto the process. They also feel they trust the process more when they [fully] understandit.2 These sentiments, connection to and trust in our democratic process, are exactly what wewant from our voting rights legislation. Our challenges, of course, don't end at reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act. We have toprevent the problems we've seen in recent elections from happening again. We've seenpolitical operatives purge voters from registration rolls for no legitimate reason, preventeligible ex-felons from casting ballots, distribute polling equipment unevenly, and deceivevoters about the time, location, and rules of elections. And unfortunately, these efforts havebeen directed primarily at minority voters -- the disabled, low-income individuals, and otherhistorically disenfranchised groups. The Help America Vote Act, or HAVA, was a big step in the right direction. But we've got to domore. We need to fully fund HAVA if we're going to move forward in the next stage of securingthe right to vote for every citizen. We need to enforce critical requirements like statewideregistration databases. We need to make sure polling equipment is distributed equitably andequipment actually works. And we need to work on getting more people to the polls onelection day. We need to make sure that minority voters are not the subject of some deplorableintimidation tactics when they do go to the polls. You know, in 2004 Native American voters in South Dakota were confronted by men posing aslaw enforcement. These hired intimidators joked about jail time for ballot missteps andfollowed voters to their cars to record their license plates. [""]In Lake County, Ohio, some voters received a memo on bogus Board of Election[s]letterhead, informing voters who registered through Democratic and NAACP drives that theycould not vote.[""]3 In Wisconsin, a flier purporting to be from the ""Milwaukee Black Voters League"" was circulatedin predominantly African-American neighborhoods with the following message: ""If you'vealready voted in any election this year, you can't vote in the presidential election. ""If youviolate any of these laws, you can get ten years in prison and your children will get takenaway from you.""4 Now, think about that. We've got a lot more work to do. This occasion is a cause forcelebration. But it's also an opportunity to renew our commitment to voting rights. AsCongressman Lewis said last week: It's clear that we've come a great distance, but we stillhave a great distance to go.5,6 Now, the memory of Selma still lives on in the spirit of theVoting Rights Act. Since that day, the Voting Rights Act has been a critical tool in ensuringthat all Americans not only have the right to vote but have the right to have their votecounted. And those of us concerned about protecting those rights can't afford to sit on our laurels uponreauthorization of this bill. We need to take advantage of this rare, united front and continueto fight to ensure unimpeded access to the polls of all Americans. In other words, we need totake the spirit that existed on that bridge, and we have to spread it across this country. You know, two weeks after the first march was turned back, Dr. King spoke, and he told agathering of organizers and activists and community members -- he said that they should notdespair because ""the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice."" The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice. That's because of the workthat each of us do that it bends toward justice. It's because of people like John Lewis andFannie Lou Hamer and Coretta Scott King and Rosa Parks -- all the giants upon whoseshoulders we stand -- that we are beneficiaries of that arc bending toward justice. That's why I stand here today. I would not be in the United States Senate had it not been forthe efforts and courage of so many parents and grandparents and ordinary people who werewilling to reach up and bend that arc in the direction of justice. I hope we continue to see that spirit live on not just during this debate but throughout all ourwork here in the Senate. Thank you, Mr. President.

"Good morning, everybody. Before I introduce America's next Surgeon General, I'd like to saya few words about our ongoing efforts to reform the health care system that she will helpoversee. We are now closer to the goal of health care reform than we have ever been. Over the lastseveral weeks, key committees in the House and the Senate have made important andunprecedented progress on a plan that will lower costs, provide better care for patients, andcurb the worst practices of the insurance companies. It's a plan that will not add to our deficitover the next decade. Let me repeat that: It is a plan that will not add to our deficit over thenext decade -- and eventually will help lower our deficit by slowing the skyrocketing cost ofMedicare and Medicaid. Even though we are close, I've got no illusions that it's going to be easy to get over the finishline. There are going to be more debates and more disagreements before all is said anddone. But health care reform must be done. I know there are those who believe we should wait to solve this problem, or take a moreincremental approach, or simply do nothing. But this is the kind of criticism we heard whenthe country tried to pass Medicare, a program that is now providing quality care togenerations of American seniors. It's the kind of criticism we heard when we tried to pass theChildren's Health Insurance Program, which has provided quality care and coverage to millionsof kids. It's the same Washington thinking that has ignored big challenges and put off toughdecisions for decades. And it is precisely that kind of small thinking that has led us into thecurrent predicament. So make no mistake: The status quo on health care is no longer an option for the UnitedStates of America. If we step back from this challenge right now, we will leave our children alegacy of debt -- a future of crushing costs that bankrupt our families, our businesses, andbecause we will have done nothing to bring down the cost of Medicare and Medicaid, will crushour government. Premiums will continue to skyrocket -- placing what amounts to another taxon American families struggling to pay bills. The insurance companies and special intereststhat have killed reform in the past will only continue to benefit even more -- and they'llcontinue to deny coverage to Americans with pre-existing medical conditions. People willcontinue to lose health insurance just because they lose their job or they change jobs. This is a future that we cannot afford. This country can't afford to have health care premiumsrise three times faster than people's wages, as they did over the last decade. We can't afford14,000 Americans losing their health care every single day. We can't afford a future whereour government will eventually spend more on Medicare and Medicaid than what we spend oneverything else. And during the campaign, I promised health care reform that would control costs, expandcoverage, and ensure choice. And I promised that Americans making $250,000 a year or lesswould not pay more in taxes. These are promises that we're keeping as reform movesforward. This is no longer a problem we can wait to fix. This is about who we are as a country. Healthcare reform is about every family's health, but it's also about the health of the economy. So I just want to put everybody on notice, because there was a lot of chatter during the weekthat I was gone: We are going to get this done. Inaction is not an option. And for those nay- sayers and cynics who think that this is not going to happen, don't bet against us. We aregoing to make this thing happen, because the American people desperately need it. And even those who are satisfied with their health care right now, they understand that ifpremiums keep on doubling and if employers keep on shedding health insurance because it'sunsustainable and if you look at the trajectory of where Medicare and Medicaid are going, theninaction will create the biggest crisis of all. And so I understand people are a little nervous and a little scared about making change. Themuscles in this town to bring about big changes are a little atrophied, but we're whipping folksback into shape. We are going to get this done. And if there's anyone who understands theurgency of meeting this challenge in a personal and powerful way, it's the woman who willbecome our nation's next Surgeon General, Dr. Regina Benjamin. The list of qualifications that make Dr. Benjamin an outstanding candidate to be America'sleading spokesperson on issues of public health are long indeed. She was in the second classat Morehouse School of Medicine and went on to earn an MD from the University of Alabamaat Birmingham and an MBA from Tulane. She served as Associate Dean for Rural Health atthe University of South Alabama College of Medicine, and in 1995, she became the firstphysician under 40 and the first African American woman to be named to the AmericanMedical Association's Board of Trustees. In 2002, she became President of Alabama's StateMedical Association. And she has received numerous awards and recognitions, including theMacArthur Genius Award. It's very impressive. But of all these achievements and experience, none has been more pertinent to today'schallenges or closer to Regina's heart than the rural health clinic that she has built and rebuiltin Bayou La Batre -- did I say that right? Well, tell me how to say it. Dr. Benjamin: Bayou La Batre. President Obama: Bayou La Batre. That's in Alabama, people. Bayou La Batre is a rural town of about 2,500 people. It's a shrimping town, where a lot offolks work for themselves, scrape by, and can't usually afford health insurance. And by theway, Dr. Benjamin, while we were talking in the Oval Office, described for me thedemographics of this town are actually very interesting, because you've got whites, blacks,and Asians in this community. There are a lot of Laotians and Cambodians who have movedthere and are part of this shrimping town, so it's a diverse but very poor rural community. And like so many other rural communities, doctors and hospitals are hard to come by. Andthat's why, even though she could have left the state to make more money as a specialist oras a doctor in a wealthier community, Regina Benjamin returned to Alabama and opened asmall clinic in Bayou La Batre. When people couldn't pay, she didn't charge them. When the clinic wasn't making money,she didn't take a salary for herself. When Hurricane George destroyed the clinic in 1998, shemade house calls to all her patients while it was rebuilt. When Hurricane Katrina destroyed itagain and left most of her town homeless, she mortgaged her house and maxed out her creditcards to rebuild that clinic for a second time. She tended to those who had been wounded inthe storm, and when folks needed medicine, she asked the pharmacist to send the bill herway. And when Regina's clinic was about to open for the third time, and a fire burned it to theground before it could serve the first patient, well, you can guess what Dr. Benjamin did. With help from her community, she is rebuilding it again. One disabled patient brought her anenvelope with $20 inside. Another elderly man said simply, ""Maybe I can help. I got ahammer."" For nearly two decades, Dr. Regina Benjamin has seen in a very personal way what is brokenabout our health care system. She's seen an increasing number of patients who've had healthinsurance their entire lives suddenly lose it because they lost their jobs or because it's simplybecome too expensive. She's been a relentless promoter of prevention and wellnessprograms, having treated too many costly and -- diseases and complications that didn't haveto happen. And she's witnessed the shortage of primary care physicians in the rural andunderserved areas where she works. But for all that she's seen and all the tremendous obstacles that she has overcome, ReginaBenjamin also represents what's best about health care in America -- doctors and nurses whogive and care and sacrifice for the sake of their patients; those Americans who would doanything to heal a fellow citizen. Through floods and fires and severe want, Regina Benjaminhas refused to give up. Her patients have refused to give up. And when we were talking inthe Oval Office, she said: The one thing I want to do is make sure that this Surgeon General'sOffice gives voice to patients, that patients have a seat at the table; somebody is advocatingfor them and speaking for them. And now we in Washington and across America have to refuse to give up on the goal of healthcare that is affordable and accessible for every last one of us. We don't have to deal withhurricanes and we don't have to deal with floods and we don't have to deal with fires; all wehave to do is pass a bill to make sure that the American people have a decent shot at gettingthe kind of choice and high-quality health care that's affordable. And I know that Dr. Benjamin is going to help us get there as the next Surgeon General. AndI am truly honored to nominate her for that post, and Secretary Sebelius is equally excited,even though she's just standing here. With that, let me introduce the next Surgeon General of the United States, Dr. ReginaBenjamin.",obama
"Hello, Michigan! Thank you. Thank you so much. First of all, give Joe a big round of applausefor the wonderful introduction. We've got some special guests here -- now, if everybody haschairs, go ahead and use them. Feel free. We've got some special guests here today that Ijust want to acknowledge. All of you are special, but these folks I want to make sure that youhave a chance to see them. First of all, one of the best governors in the country, please give Jennifer Granholm a biground of applause. Lieutenant Governor John Cherry -- give John a big round of applause. One of my favorite people, a former colleague of mine, still just a fighter on behalf of workingfamilies each and every day -- Senator Debbie Stabenow. We've got Speaker of the House,Andy Dillon, in the house. We've got a lot of other local elected officials, and I just want tothank them. A couple of people who are missing: Carl Levin, who is doing great work. He's in the Senateright now fighting on behalf of a bill to make sure that we're not loading up a bunch ofnecessary defense spending with unnecessary defense spending. So he's the point person onit. The only reason he's not here is because he is working alongside the administration to getthis bill done. Please give him a big round of applause. Congressman Sandy Levin, alsoworking hard on your behalf each and every day, but is not here today. I want to go aheadand acknowledge the new mayor, since he's the new mayor -- Mayor Dave Bing, great ballplayer. My game is a little like Dave Bing's -- except I don't have the jump shot or the speedor the ball handling skills -- or the endurance. Also don't have the afro. Don't think I forgotthat, Dave. I remember. I remember that. I also want to acknowledge that we've got the Executive Director of the White House Councilon Auto Communities and Workers, who's working hard, has a direct line to me each andevery day. He's traveling constantly back here -- Ed Montgomery. Please give Ed a big roundof applause. And the Chairman of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indian Tribe, DerekBailey is here. Please give Derek a big round of applause. And finally, the president of the college where we are here, Jim Jacobs. Give Jim Jacobs a biground of applause. And those of you who I've missed, you know how grateful I am that you're here. And thankyou all. It is wonderful to be back at Macomb. It was terrific visiting this campus as acandidate, but I have to admit, it's even better visiting as a President. Now, this is a place where anyone -- anyone with a desire to learn and to grow, to take theircareer to a new level or start a new career altogether -- has the opportunity to pursue theirdream, right here in Macomb. This is a place where people of all ages and all backgrounds --even in the face of obstacles, even in the face of very difficult personal challenges -- can takea chance on a brighter future for themselves and their families. There are folks like Joe, who just told us his story. When Joe lost his job, he decided to takeadvantage of assistance for displaced workers. He earned his associate degree here atMacomb, and with a pretty impressive GPA, I might add. And with the help of that degree,Joe found a new job, working for the new Henry Ford West Bloomfield Hospital as amaintenance mechanic, using the skills he learned here and the talents that he brought tomake a fresh start. There are workers like Kellie Kulman, who is here today. Where's Kellie? Raise your hand,Kellie. Where are you? There you are. There's Kellie right there. Kellie is a UAW worker at aFord plant in Sterling Heights, Michigan. She used to drive a fork lift, right? But then shedecided to train here at Macomb for a job that required new skills, and now she's anapprentice pipe fitter. It's a telling example: Even as this painful restructuring takes place inour auto industry, workers are seeking out training for new auto jobs. And Joe and Kellie'sstory make clear what all of you know: Community colleges are an essential part of ourrecovery in the present -- and our prosperity in the future. This place can make the futurebetter, not just for these individuals but for America. Now, since this recession began 20 months ago, 6.5 million Americans have lost their jobs,and I don't have to tell you Michigan in particular has been hard-hit. Now, I -- the statisticsare daunting. The whole country now, the unemployment rate is approaching 10 percent. Here in Michigan, it's about five points higher. And new jobs of course are going to be comingout and we're going to see continuing job loss even as the economy is beginning to stabilize. Now, that's not just abstractions. Those just aren't numbers on a page. Those areextraordinary hardships, tough times, for families and individuals who've worked hard all theirlives and have done the right things all their lives. If you haven't lost a job, chances are youknow somebody who has: a family member, a neighbor, a friend, a coworker. And you knowthat as difficult as the financial struggle can be, the sense of loss is about more than just apaycheck, because most of us define ourselves by the work we do. That's part of what itmeans to be an American. We take pride in work -- that sense that you're contributing,supporting your family, meeting your responsibilities. People need work not just for income,but because it makes you part of that fabric of a community that's so important. And so whenyou lose your job, and when entire communities are losing thousands of jobs, that's a heavyburden, that's a heavy weight. Now, my administration has a job to do, as well, and that job is to get this economy back onits feet. That's my job. And it's a job I gladly accept. I love these folks who helped get us inthis mess and then suddenly say, well, this is Obama's economy. That's fine. Give it to me. My job is to solve problems, not to stand on the sidelines and harp and gripe. So I welcome the job. I want the responsibility. And I know that -- let's just take anexample. Many questioned our efforts to help save GM and Chrysler from collapse earlier thisyear. Their feeling was these companies were driven to the brink by poor managementdecisions over a long period of time, and like any business they should be held accountable forthose decisions. I agree that they should be held accountable. But I also recognize thehistoric significance and economic prominence of these companies in communities all acrossMichigan and all across the country. I thought about the hundreds of thousands of Americans whose livelihoods are still connectedto the American auto industry, and the impact on an already struggling economy, especiallyright here in Michigan. So I said that if Chrysler and GM were willing to fundamentallyrestructure their businesses and make the hard choices necessary to become competitive nowand in the future, it was a process worth supporting. Now today, after a painful period of soul-searching and sacrifice, both GM and Chrysler haveemerged from bankruptcy. Remember, folks said there was no way they could do it? They'vegotten it done already, in record time -- far faster than anybody thought possible. They'vegot a leaner structure, they've got new management, and a viable vision of how to competeand win in the 21st century. Those sacrifices were shared among all the stakeholders: workers and management; creditors and shareholders; retirees and communities. Andtogether, they've made the rebirth of Chrysler and GM possible. It was the right thing to do. But even with this positive news, the hard truth is, is that some of the jobs that have beenlost in the auto industry and elsewhere won't be coming back. They're the casualties of achanging economy. In some cases, just increased productivity in the plants themselvesmeans that some jobs aren't going to return. And that only underscores the importance ofgenerating new businesses and new industries to replace the ones that we've lost, and ofpreparing our workers to fill the jobs they create. For even before this recession hit, we werefaced with an economy that was simply not creating or sustaining enough new, well-payingjobs. So now is the time to change all that. What we face is far more than a passing crisis. This isa transformative moment. And in this moment we must do what other generations havedone. It's not the time to shrink from the challenges we face or put off tough decisions. That's what Washington has done for decades, and it's exactly why I ran for President -- tochange that mindset. Now is the time to build a firmer, stronger foundation for growth thatwill not only withstand future economic storms, but that will help us thrive and compete in aglobal economy. To build that foundation, we have to slow the growth of health care coststhat are driving us into debt. We're going to have to do that, and there's going to be a majordebate over the next three weeks. And don't be fooled by folks trying to scare you, saying wecan't change the health care system. We have no choice but to change the health caresystem, because right now it's broken for too many Americans. We're going to have to make tough choices necessary to bring down deficits. But don't letfolks fool you -- the best way to start bringing down deficits is to get control of our health carecosts, which is why we need reform. Now is the time to create the jobs of the future by growing industries, including a new cleanenergy economy. And Jennifer Granholm has been all on top of this as the governor ofMichigan. She is bring cleaning [sic] energy jobs right here to Michigan, and we've got tosupport her in that effort. I want Michigan to build windmills and wind turbines and solar panels and biofuel plants andenergy-efficient light bulbs and weatherize all our -- because, Michigan, you know badweather. So you can be all on top of weatherizing. You need to weatherize. I know aboutthat in Chicago too. But we also have to ensure that we're educating and preparing our people for the new jobs ofthe 21st century. We've got to prepare our people with the skills they need to compete in thisglobal economy. Time and again, when we placed our bet for the future on education, wehave prospered as a result -- by tapping the incredible innovative and generative potential ofa skilled American workforce. That's what happened when President Lincoln signed into lawlegislation creating the land grant colleges, which not only transformed higher education, butalso our entire economy. That's what took place when President Roosevelt signed the GI Billwhich helped educate a generation, and ushered in an era of unprecedented prosperity. Thatwas the foundation for the American middle class. And that's why, at the start of my administration I set a goal for America: By 2020, thisnation will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world. We usedto have that. We're going to have it again. And we've begun to take historic steps to achievethis goal. Already we've increased Pell grants by $500. We've created a $2,500 tax credit forfour years of college tuition. We've simplified student aid applications and ensured that aid isnot based on the income of a job that you just lost. A new GI Bill of Rights for the 21stcentury is beginning to help soldiers coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan to begin a newlife -- in a new economy. And the recovery plan has helped close state budget shortfalls --which put enormous pressure on public universities and community colleges -- at the sametime making historic investments in school libraries and classrooms and facilities all acrossAmerica. So we've already taken some steps that are building the foundation for a 21stcentury education system here in America, one that will allow us to compete with China andIndia and everybody else all around the world. But today I'm announcing the most significant down payment yet on reaching the goal ofhaving the highest college graduation rate of any nation in the world. We're going to achievethis in the next 10 years. And it's called the American Graduation Initiative. It will reformand strengthen community colleges like this one from coast to coast so they get the resourcesthat students and schools need -- and the results workers and businesses demand. Throughthis plan, we seek to help an additional 5 million Americans earn degrees and certificates inthe next decade -- 5 million. Not since the passage of the original GI Bill and the work of President Truman's Commissionon Higher Education -- which helped to double the number of community colleges andincrease by seven-fold enrollment in those colleges -- have we taken such a historic step onbehalf of community colleges in America. And let me be clear: We pay for this plan -- thisisn't adding to the deficit; we're paying for this plan -- by ending the wasteful subsidies wecurrently provide to banks and private lenders for student loans. That will save tens of billionsof dollars over the next 10 years. Instead of lining the pockets of special interests, it's timethis money went towards the interests of higher education in America. That's what myadministration is committed to doing. Now, I know that for a long time there have been politicians who have spoken of training as asilver bullet and college as a cure-all. It's not, and we know that. I can't tell you how manyworkers who've been laid off, you talk to them about training and they say, ""Training forwhat?"" So I understand the frustrations that a lot of people have, especially if the training isnot well designed for the specific jobs that are being created out there. But we know that in the coming years, jobs requiring at least an associate degree areprojected to grow twice as fast as jobs requiring no college experience. We will not fill thosejobs -- or even keep those jobs here in America -- without the training offered by communitycolleges. That's why I want to applaud Governor Granholm for the No Worker Left Behindprogram. It's providing up to two years' worth of free tuition at community colleges anduniversities across the state. The rest of the country should learn from the effort. This is training to become a medical technician, or a health IT worker, or a lab specialist, or anurse. In fact, 59 percent of all new nurses come from community colleges. This is trainingto install solar panels and build those wind turbines we were talking about and develop asmarter electricity grid. And this is the kind of education that more and more Americans areusing to improve their skills and broaden their horizons. Many young people are savingmoney by spending two years at community college before heading to a four-year college. And more workers who have lost their jobs -- or fear losing a job -- are seeking an edge atschools like this one. At the same time, community colleges are under increasing pressure to cap enrollments andscrap courses and cut costs as states and municipalities face budget shortfalls. And this is inaddition to the challenges you face in the best of times, as these schools receive far lessfunding per student than typical four-year colleges and universities. So community collegesare an undervalued asset in our country. Not only is that not right, it's not smart. That's whyI've asked Dr. Jill Biden -- who happens to be a relation of the Vice President, Joe Biden, butwho is also a community college educator for more than 16 years -- to promote communitycolleges and help us make community colleges stronger. And that's why we're putting inplace this American Graduation Initiative. Let me describe for you the specifics of what we're going to do. Number one, we will offercompetitive grants, challenging community colleges to pursue innovative, results-orientedstrategies in exchange for federal funding. We'll fund programs that connect students lookingfor jobs with businesses that are looking to hire. We'll challenge these schools to find newand better ways to help students catch up on the basics, like math and science, that areessential to our competitiveness. We'll put colleges and employers together to createprograms that match curricula in the classroom with the needs of the boardroom. These are all kinds of -- there are all kinds of examples of what's possible. We've seen Cisco,for example, working with community colleges to prepare students and workers for jobsranging from work in broadband to health IT. We know that the most successful communitycolleges are those that partner with the private sector. So we want to encourage morecompanies to work with schools to build these type of relationships. That way, whensomebody goes through a training program, they know that there's a job at the end of thattraining. We'll also create a new research center with a simple mission: to measure what works andwhat doesn't. All too often, we don't know what happens when somebody walks out of aclassroom and onto the factory floor or into the library or -- the laboratory or the office. Andthat means businesses often can't be sure what a degree is really worth. And schoolsthemselves don't have the facts to make informed choices about which programs receive --achieve results and which programs don't. And this is important, not just for businesses andcolleges, but for students and workers, as well. If a parent is going to spend time in theclassroom and away from his or her family -- especially after a long day at work -- thatdegree really has to mean something. They have to know that when they get that degree, this is going to help advance their goals. If a worker is going to spend two years training to enter into a whole new profession, thatcertificate has to mean that he or she is ready, and that businesses are ready to hire. In addition, we want to propose new funding for innovative strategies that promote not justenrollment in a community college program, but completion of that program. See, more thanhalf -- more than half of all students who enter community college to earn an associatedegree, or transfer to a four-year school to earn a bachelor's degree, unfortunately fail toreach their goal. That's not just a waste of a valuable resource, that's a tragedy for thesestudents. Oftentimes they've taken out debt and they don't get the degree, but they still haveto pay back the debt. And it's a disaster for our economy. So we'll fund programs that track student progress inside and outside the classroom. Let'sfigure out what's keeping students from crossing that finish line, and then put in place reformsthat will remove those barriers. Maybe it becomes too difficult for a parent to be away fromhome, or too expensive for a waiter or a nurse to miss a shift. Maybe a young student justisn't sure if her education will lead to employment. The point is, we need to figure outsolutions for these kinds of challenges -- because facing these impediments shouldn't preventyou from reaching your potential. All right, so that's a big chunk of this first part of this initiative. The second part: We're goingto back $10 billion in loans to renovate and rebuild college classrooms and buildings all acrossthe country. All too often, community colleges are treated like the stepchild of the highereducation system; they're an afterthought, if they're thought of at all. And that meansschools are often years behind in the facilities they provide, which means, in a 21st centuryeconomy, they're years behind in the education they can offer. That's a mistake and it's onethat we'll help to correct. Through this fund, schools will have the chance to borrow at a moreaffordable rate to modernize facilities, and they'll be building on the funds in the recovery planthat are already helping to renovate schools, including community colleges all across thecountry. And by the way, not only does this improve the schools and the training that they'reproviding, guess what? You also have to hire some workers and some tradesmen and womento do the work on those schools. So it means it's putting people to work in Michigan righthere right now. Number three: Even as we repair bricks and mortar, we have an opportunity to build a newvirtual infrastructure to complement the education and training community colleges can offer. So we're going to support the creation of a new online, open-source clearinghouse of coursesso that community colleges across the country can offer more classes without building moreclassrooms. And this will make a big difference especially for rural campuses that a lot oftimes have struggled -- attract -- have to struggle to attract students and faculty. And thiswill make it possible for a professor to complement his lecture with an online exercise, or for astudent who can't be away from her family to still keep up with her coursework. We don't know where this kind of experiment will lead, but that's exactly why we ought to tryit because I think there's a possibility that online education can provide especially for peoplewho are already in the workforce and want to retrain the chance to upgrade their skillswithout having to quit their job. So let me say this more: The road to recovery, the road to prosperity, is going to be hard. Itwas never going to be easy. When I was sworn in, we were seeing 700 [thousand] jobs lostthat month. Then we had the same amount lost for two more consecutive months. Nowwe've got an average of about 400,000 jobs lost -- but we're still losing too many jobs. Wewill get to the point where we're not losing jobs, but then we've got to start getting to thepoint where we're actually creating jobs. And it's going to take time. There are going to be false starts and there are going to besetbacks. But I am confident that we can meet the challenges we face, because that's whatwe've always done. That's what America does. We hit some challenges, we fuss and argueabout it, and then we go ahead and go about the business of solving our problems. That'swhat we see on display right here at Macomb Community College. That's what I've seen atcolleges and universities all across this country. At every juncture in our history when we'vebeen challenged, we have summoned the resilience and the industriousness -- that can-doAmerican spirit -- that has allowed us to succeed in the face of even the toughest odds. That's what we can and must do now, not just to overcome this crisis, but to leave somethingbetter behind, to lay a foundation on which our children and our grandchildren can prosperand take responsibility for their future -- just as the students at this school, at this difficultmoment, are taking responsibility for theirs. I am absolutely confident that if I've got your help, that we can make it happen, and we aregoing to see a stronger, more prosperous Michigan in the years to come. Thank you very much, Warren. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.",obama
"Today we say goodbye to the youngest child of Rose and Joseph Kennedy. The world will long remembertheir son Edward as the heir to a weighty legacy; a champion for those who had none; the soul of theDemocratic Party; and the lion of the U.S. Senate -- a man whose name graces nearly one thousand laws,and who penned more than three hundred himself. But those of us who loved him, and ache with his passing, know Ted Kennedy by the other titles he held:Father. Brother. Husband. Uncle Teddy, or as he was often known to his younger nieces and nephews,""The Grand Fromage,"" or ""The Big Cheese."" I, like so many others in the city where he worked for nearlyhalf a century, knew him as a colleague, a mentor, and above all, a friend. Ted Kennedy was the baby of the family who became its patriarch; the restless dreamer who became itsrock. He was the sunny, joyful child, who bore the brunt of his brothers' teasing, but learned quickly how tobrush it off. When they tossed him off a boat because he didn't know what a jib was, six-year-old Teddy gotback in and learned to sail. When a photographer asked the newly-elected Bobby to step back at a pressconference because he was casting a shadow on his younger brother, Teddy quipped, ""It'll be the same inWashington."" This spirit of resilience and good humor would see Ted Kennedy through more pain and tragedy than mostof us will ever know. He lost two siblings by the age of sixteen. He saw two more taken violently from thecountry that loved them. He said goodbye to his beloved sister, Eunice, in the final days of his own life. Henarrowly survived a plane crash, watched two children struggle with cancer, buried three nephews, andexperienced personal failings and setbacks in the most public way possible. It is a string of events that would have broken a lesser man. And it would have been easy for Teddy to lethimself become bitter and hardened; to surrender to self-pity and regret; to retreat from public life and liveout his years in peaceful quiet. No one would have blamed him for that. But that was not Ted Kennedy. As he told us, ""...[I]ndividual faults and frailties are no excuse to give in - andno exemption from the common obligation to give of ourselves."" Indeed, Ted was the ""Happy Warrior"" thatthe poet William Wordsworth spoke of when he wrote: As tempted more; more able to endure, As more exposed to suffering and distress; Thence, also, more alive to tenderness. Through his own suffering, Ted Kennedy became more alive to the plight and suffering of others -- the sickchild who could not see a doctor; the young soldier sent to battle without armor; the citizen denied her rightsbecause of what she looks like or who she loves or where she comes from. The landmark laws that hechampioned -- the Civil Rights Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, immigration reform, children's healthcare, the Family and Medical Leave Act -- all have a running thread. Ted Kennedy's life's work was not tochampion those with wealth or power or special connections. It was to give a voice to those who were notheard; to add a rung to the ladder of opportunity; to make real the dream of our founding. He was given thegift of time that his brothers were not, and he used that gift to touch as many lives and right as many wrongsas the years would allow. We can still hear his voice bellowing through the Senate chamber, face reddened, fist pounding the podium,a veritable force of nature, in support of health care or workers' rights or civil rights. And yet, while hiscauses became deeply personal, his disagreements never did. While he was seen by his fiercest critics as apartisan lightning rod, that is not the prism through which Ted Kennedy saw the world, nor was it the prismthrough which his colleagues saw him. He was a product of an age when the joy and nobility of politicsprevented differences of party and philosophy from becoming barriers to cooperation and mutual respect --a time when adversaries still saw each other as patriots. And that's how Ted Kennedy became the greatest legislator of our time. He did it by hewing to principle, butalso by seeking compromise and common cause -- not through deal-making and horse-trading alone, butthrough friendship, and kindness, and humor. There was the time he courted Orrin Hatch's support for theChildren's Health Insurance Program by having his Chief of Staff serenade the Senator with a song Orrinhad written himself; the time he delivered shamrock cookies on a china plate to sweeten up a crustyRepublican colleague; and the famous story of how he won the support of a Texas Committee Chairman onan immigration bill. Teddy walked into a meeting with a plain manila envelope, and showed only theChairman that it was filled with the Texan's favorite cigars. When the negotiations were going well, he wouldinch the envelope closer to the Chairman. When they weren't, he would pull it back. Before long, the dealwas done. It was only a few years ago, on St. Patrick's Day, when Teddy buttonholed me on the floor of the Senate formy support on a certain piece of legislation that was coming up for vote. I gave him my pledge, butexpressed my skepticism that it would pass. But when the roll call was over, the bill garnered the votes itneeded, and then some. I looked at Teddy with astonishment and asked how he had pulled it off. He justpatted me on the back, and said ""Luck of the Irish!"" Of course, luck had little to do with Ted Kennedy's legislative success, and he knew that. A few years ago,his father-in-law told him that he and Daniel Webster just might be the two greatest senators of all time.Without missing a beat, Teddy replied, ""What did Webster do?"" But though it is Ted Kennedy's historic body of achievements we will remember, it is his giving heart that wewill miss. It was the friend and colleague who was always the first to pick up the phone and say, ""I'm sorryfor your loss,"" or ""I hope you feel better,"" or ""What can I do to help?"" It was the boss who was so adored byhis staff that over five hundred spanning five decades showed up for his 75th birthday party. It was the manwho sent birthday wishes and thank you notes and even his own paintings to so many who never imaginedthat a U.S. Senator would take the time to think about someone like them. I have one of those paintings inmy private study -- a Cape Cod seascape that was a gift to a freshman legislator who happened to admire itwhen Ted Kennedy welcomed him into his office the first week he arrived in Washington; by the way, that'smy second favorite gift from Teddy and Vicki after our dog Bo. And it seems like everyone has one of thosestories - the ones that often start with ""You wouldn't believe who called me today."" Ted Kennedy was the father who looked after not only his own three children, but John's and Bobby's aswell. He took them camping and taught them to sail. He laughed and danced with them at birthdays andweddings; cried and mourned with them through hardship and tragedy; and passed on that same sense ofservice and selflessness that his parents had instilled in him. Shortly after Ted walked Caroline down theaisle and gave her away at the altar, he received a note from Jackie that read, ""On you the carefreeyoungest brother fell a burden a hero would have begged to be spared. We are all going to make it becauseyou were always there with your love."" Not only did the Kennedy family make it because of Ted's love -- he made it because of theirs; andespecially because of the love and the life he found in Vicki. After so much loss and so much sorrow, itcould not have been easy for Ted Kennedy to risk his heart again. That he did is a testament to how deeplyhe loved this remarkable woman from Louisiana. And she didn't just love him back. As Ted would oftenacknowledge, Vicki saved him. She gave him strength and purpose; joy and friendship; and stood by himalways, especially in those last, hardest days. We cannot know for certain how long we have here. We cannot foresee the trials or misfortunes that will testus along the way. We cannot know God's plan for us. What we can do is to live out our lives as best we can with purpose, and love, and joy. We can use eachday to show those who are closest to us how much we care about them, and treat others with the kindnessand respect that we wish for ourselves. We can learn from our mistakes and grow from our failures. And wecan strive at all costs to make a better world, so that someday, if we are blessed with the chance to lookback on our time here, we can know that we spent it well; that we made a difference; that our fleetingpresence had a lasting impact on the lives of other human beings. This is how Ted Kennedy lived. This is his legacy. He once said of his brother Bobby that he need not beidealized or enlarged in death beyond what he was in life, and I imagine he would say the same abouthimself. The greatest expectations were placed upon Ted Kennedy's shoulders because of who he was, buthe surpassed them all because of who he became. We do not weep for him today because of the prestigeattached to his name or his office. We weep because we loved this kind and tender hero who perseveredthrough pain and tragedy -- not for the sake of ambition or vanity; not for wealth or power; but only for thepeople and the country he loved. In the days after September 11th, Teddy made it a point to personally call each one of the 177 families ofthis state who lost a loved one in the attack. But he didn't stop there. He kept calling and checking up onthem. He fought through red tape to get them assistance and grief counseling. He invited them sailing,played with their children, and would write each family a letter whenever the anniversary of that terrible daycame along. To one widow, he wrote the following: As you know so well, the passage of time never really heals the tragic memory of such a great loss,but we carry on, because we have to, because our loved one would want us to, and because thereis still light to guide us in the world from the love they gave us. We carry on. Ted Kennedy has gone home now, guided by his faith and by the light of those he has loved and lost. At lasthe is with them once more, leaving those of us who grieve his passing with the memories he gave, the goodhe did, the dream he kept alive, and a single, enduring image -- the image of a man on a boat; white manetousled; smiling broadly as he sails into the wind, ready for what storms may come, carrying on towardsome new and wondrous place just beyond the horizon. May God Bless Ted Kennedy, and may he rest ineternal peace.",obama
"Hello, everybody! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. All right, everybody goahead and have a seat. How is everybody doing today? How about Tim Spicer? I am here withstudents at Wakefield High School in Arlington, Virginia. And we've got students tuning infrom all across America, from kindergarten through 12th grade. And I am just so glad that allcould join us today. And I want to thank Wakefield for being such an outstanding host. Giveyourselves a big round of applause. I know that for many of you, today is the first day of school. And for those of you inkindergarten, or starting middle or high school, it's your first day in a new school, so it'sunderstandable if you're a little nervous. I imagine there are some seniors out there who arefeeling pretty good right now -- with just one more year to go. And no matter what gradeyou're in, some of you are probably wishing it were still summer and you could've stayed inbed just a little bit longer this morning. I know that feeling. When I was young, my family lived overseas. I lived in Indonesia for afew years. And my mother, she didn't have the money to send me where all the American kidswent to school, but she thought it was important for me to keep up with an Americaneducation. So she decided to teach me extra lessons herself, Monday through Friday. Butbecause she had to go to work, the only time she could do it was at 4:30 in the morning. Now, as you might imagine, I wasn't too happy about getting up that early. And a lot of times,I'd fall asleep right there at the kitchen table. But whenever I'd complain, my mother wouldjust give me one of those looks and she'd say, ""This is no picnic for me either, buster."" So I know that some of you are still adjusting to being back at school. But I'm here todaybecause I have something important to discuss with you. I'm here because I want to talk withyou about your education and what's expected of all of you in this new school year. Now, I've given a lot of speeches about education. And I've talked about responsibility a lot. I've talked about teachers' responsibility for inspiring students and pushing you to learn. I've talked about your parents' responsibility for making sure you stay on track, and you getyour homework done, and don't spend every waking hour in front of the TV or with the Xbox. I've talked a lot about your government's responsibility for setting high standards, andsupporting teachers and principals, and turning around schools that aren't working, wherestudents aren't getting the opportunities that they deserve. But at the end of the day, we can have the most dedicated teachers, the most supportiveparents, the best schools in the world -- and none of it will make a difference, none of it willmatter unless all of you fulfill your responsibilities, unless you show up to those schools,unless you pay attention to those teachers, unless you listen to your parents andgrandparents and other adults and put in the hard work it takes to succeed. That's what Iwant to focus on today: the responsibility each of you has for your education. I want to start with the responsibility you have to yourself. Every single one of you hassomething that you're good at. Every single one of you has something to offer. And you havea responsibility to yourself to discover what that is. That's the opportunity an education canprovide. Maybe you could be a great writer -- maybe even good enough to write a book or articles in anewspaper -- but you might not know it until you write that English paper -- that English classpaper that's assigned to you. Maybe you could be an innovator or an inventor -- maybe evengood enough to come up with the next iPhone or the new medicine or vaccine -- but youmight not know it until you do your project for your science class. Maybe you could be amayor or a senator or a Supreme Court justice -- but you might not know that until you joinstudent government or the debate team. And no matter what you want to do with your life, I guarantee that you'll need an education todo it. You want to be a doctor, or a teacher, or a police officer? You want to be a nurse or anarchitect, a lawyer or a member of our military? You're going to need a good education forevery single one of those careers. You cannot drop out of school and just drop into a good job.You've got to train for it and work for it and learn for it. And this isn't just important for your own life and your own future. What you make of youreducation will decide nothing less than the future of this country. The future of Americadepends on you. What you're learning in school today will determine whether we as a nationcan meet our greatest challenges in the future. You'll need the knowledge and problem-solving skills you learn in science and math to curediseases like cancer and AIDS, and to develop new energy technologies and protect ourenvironment. You'll need the insights and critical-thinking skills you gain in history and socialstudies to fight poverty and homelessness, crime and discrimination, and make our nationmore fair and more free. You'll need the creativity and ingenuity you develop in all yourclasses to build new companies that will create new jobs and boost our economy. We need every single one of you to develop your talents and your skills and your intellect soyou can help us old folks solve our most difficult problems. If you don't do that -- if you quiton school -- you're not just quitting on yourself, you're quitting on your country. Now, I know it's not always easy to do well in school. I know a lot of you have challenges inyour lives right now that can make it hard to focus on your schoolwork. I get it. I know what it's like. My father left my family when I was two years old, and I wasraised by a single mom who had to work and who struggled at times to pay the bills andwasn't always able to give us the things that other kids had. There were times when I missedhaving a father in my life. There were times when I was lonely and I felt like I didn't fit in. So I wasn't always as focused as I should have been on school, and I did some things I'm notproud of, and I got in more trouble than I should have. And my life could have easily taken aturn for the worse. But I was -- I was lucky. I got a lot of second chances, and I had the opportunity to go tocollege and law school and follow my dreams. My wife, our First Lady Michelle Obama, she hasa similar story. Neither of her parents had gone to college, and they didn't have a lot ofmoney. But they worked hard, and she worked hard, so that she could go to the best schoolsin this country. Some of you might not have those advantages. Maybe you don't have adults in your life whogive you the support that you need. Maybe someone in your family has lost their job andthere's not enough money to go around. Maybe you live in a neighborhood where you don'tfeel safe, or have friends who are pressuring you to do things you know aren't right. But at the end of the day, the circumstances of your life -- what you look like, where youcome from, how much money you have, what you've got going on at home -- none of that isan excuse for neglecting your homework or having a bad attitude in school. That's no excusefor talking back to your teacher, or cutting class, or dropping out of school. There is no excusefor not trying. Where you are right now doesn't have to determine where you'll end up. No one's written yourdestiny for you, because here in America, you write your own destiny. You make your ownfuture. That's what young people like you are doing every day, all across America. Young people like Jazmin Perez, from Roma, Texas. Jazmin didn't speak English when she firststarted school. Neither of her parents had gone to college. But she worked hard, earned goodgrades, and got a scholarship to Brown University -- is now in graduate school, studyingpublic health, on her way to becoming Dr. Jazmin Perez. I'm thinking about Andoni Schultz, from Los Altos, California, who's fought brain cancer sincehe was three. He's had to endure all sorts of treatments and surgeries, one of which affectedhis memory, so it took him much longer -- hundreds of extra hours -- to do his schoolwork.But he never fell behind. He's headed to college this fall. And then there's Shantell Steve, from my hometown of Chicago, Illinois. Even when bouncingfrom foster home to foster home in the toughest neighborhoods in the city, she managed toget a job at a local health care center, start a program to keep young people out of gangs,and she's on track to graduate high school with honors and go on to college. And Jazmin, Andoni, and Shantell aren't any different from any of you. They face challenges intheir lives just like you do. In some cases they've got it a lot worse off than many of you. Butthey refused to give up. They chose to take responsibility for their lives, for their education,and set goals for themselves. And I expect all of you to do the same. That's why today I'm calling on each of you to set your own goals for your education -- and doeverything you can to meet them. Your goal can be something as simple as doing all yourhomework, paying attention in class, or spending some time each day reading a book. Maybeyou'll decide to get involved in an extracurricular activity, or volunteer in your community.Maybe you'll decide to stand up for kids who are being teased or bullied because of who theyare or how they look, because you believe, like I do, that all young people deserve a safeenvironment to study and learn. Maybe you'll decide to take better care of yourself so you canbe more ready to learn. And along those lines, by the way, I hope all of you are washing yourhands a lot, and that you stay home from school when you don't feel well, so we can keeppeople from getting the flu this fall and winter. But whatever you resolve to do, I want you to commit to it. I want you to really work at it. I know that sometimes you get that sense from TV that you can be rich and successfulwithout any hard work -- that your ticket to success is through rapping or basketball or beinga reality TV star. Chances are you're not going to be any of those things. The truth is, being successful is hard. You won't love every subject that you study. You won'tclick with every teacher that you have. Not every homework assignment will seem completelyrelevant to your life right at this minute. And you won't necessarily succeed at everything thefirst time you try. That's okay. Some of the most successful people in the world are the ones who've had themost failures. J.K. Rowling's -- who wrote Harry Potter -- her first Harry Potter book wasrejected 12 times before it was finally published. Michael Jordan was cut from his high schoolbasketball team. He lost hundreds of games and missed thousands of shots during his career.But he once said, ""I have failed over and over and over again in my life. And that's why Isucceed."" These people succeeded because they understood that you can't let your failures define you --you have to let your failures teach you. You have to let them show you what to do differentlythe next time. So if you get into trouble, that doesn't mean you're a troublemaker, it meansyou need to try harder to act right. If you get a bad grade, that doesn't mean you're stupid, itjust means you need to spend more time studying. No one's born being good at all things. You become good at things through hard work. You'renot a varsity athlete the first time you play a new sport. You don't hit every note the first timeyou sing a song. You've got to practice. The same principle applies to your schoolwork. Youmight have to do a math problem a few times before you get it right. You might have to readsomething a few times before you understand it. You definitely have to do a few drafts of apaper before it's good enough to hand in. Don't be afraid to ask questions. Don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it. I do thatevery day. Asking for help isn't a sign of weakness, it's a sign of strength because it showsyou have the courage to admit when you don't know something, and that then allows you tolearn something new. So find an adult that you trust -- a parent, a grandparent or teacher, acoach or a counselor -- and ask them to help you stay on track to meet your goals. And even when you're struggling, even when you're discouraged, and you feel like otherpeople have given up on you, don't ever give up on yourself, because when you give up onyourself, you give up on your country. The story of America isn't about people who quit when things got tough. It's about people whokept going, who tried harder, who loved their country too much to do anything less than theirbest. It's the story of students who sat where you sit 250 years ago, and went on to wage arevolution and they founded this nation. Young people. Students who sat where you sit 75years ago who overcame a Depression and won a world war; who fought for civil rights andput a man on the moon. Students who sat where you sit 20 years ago who founded Googleand Twitter and Facebook and changed the way we communicate with each other. So today, I want to ask all of you, what's your contribution going to be? What problems areyou going to solve? What discoveries will you make? What will a President who comes here in20 or 50 or 100 years say about what all of you did for this country? Now, your families, your teachers, and I are doing everything we can to make sure you havethe education you need to answer these questions. I'm working hard to fix up your classroomsand get you the books and the equipment and the computers you need to learn. But you'vegot to do your part, too. So I expect all of you to get serious this year. I expect you to putyour best effort into everything you do. I expect great things from each of you. So don't let usdown. Don't let your family down or your country down. Most of all, don't let yourself down.Make us all proud. Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. God bless America. Thank you.",obama
"To Chip, Kathy, and Nancy, who graciously shared your father with a nation that loved him; toWalter's friends, colleagues, prot  g  s, and all who considered him a hero; to the men of theIntrepid; to all of you who are gathered here today; I am honored to be here to pay tribute tothe life and times of the man who chronicled our time. I did not know Mr. Cronkite personally. And my regret is made more acute by the stories thathave been shared here today. Nor, for that matter, did I know him any better than the tens ofmillions who turned to him each night in search of the answer to a simple question: ""Whathappened today?"" But like them and like all of you, I have benefited as a citizen from hisdogged pursuit of the truth, his passionate defense of objective reporting, and his view thatjournalism is more than just a profession; it is a public good vital to our democracy. Even in his early career, Walter Cronkite resisted the temptation to get the story first in favorof getting it right. He wanted to get it first, but he understood the importance of getting itright. During one of his first jobs in Kansas City, Walter's program manager urged him to goon the air reporting a massive blaze -- and we just heard how much he loved fires -- amassive blaze at city hall that had already claimed lives. When Walter reached for thetelephone, his boss asked, ""What are you doing; get on the air!"" Walter replied that he wascalling the fire department to confirm the story. ""You don't need to confirm it,"" the managershouted, ""My wife is watching the whole thing!"" Needless to say, Walter made the call, and even as the program manager took to the airhimself to broadcast the unfolding tragedy, Walter discovered that it had been nothing morethan a small fire that hadn't resulted in any injuries. He lost his job -- but he got the storyright. Walter wasn't afraid to rattle the high and the mighty, either; but he never dared tocompromise his integrity. He got along with elected officials, even if they were wary of oneanother's motives. One politician once remarked, ""Walter, my friend, you've got to believeme, fully 85 percent of everything I told you today is the absolute truth."" He shared a complicated relationship with Presidents of both parties, who wanted him on theirside even as they were convinced that he wasn't. President Johnson called Walter after theevening news from time to time to voice his displeasure over a certain story. But Walter knewthat if he was receiving vociferous complaints from both sides, he must be doing his job. His endless inquisitiveness about our world, I can imagine, came from a mother who soldencyclopedias for a living. As a boy, Walter spent countless hours getting lost within theirpages, endlessly sidetracked by new and interesting entries that branched off from oneanother, fascinated by the world around us and how it worked. And that's the way he lived his life -- with curiosity, exploring our planet, seeking to makesense of it and explaining it to others. He went everywhere and he did everything. He racedcars and boats; he traveled everywhere from the Amazon to the Arctic; he plunged 8,000 feetbelow the sea, trekked 18,000 feet up into the Himalayas, and experienced weightlessness inthe upper reaches of our atmosphere -- all with one mission: to make it come alive for therest of us. And as our world began to change, he helped us understand those changes. He was foreverthere, reporting through world war and cold war; marches and milestones; scandal andsuccess; calmly and authoritatively telling us what we needed to know. He was a voice ofcertainty in a world that was growing more and more uncertain. And through it all, he neverlost the integrity or the plainspoken speaking style that he gained growing up in theheartland. He was a familiar and welcome voice that spoke to each and every one of uspersonally. So it may have seemed inevitable that he was named the most trusted man in America. Buthere's the thing: That title wasn't bestowed on him by a network. We weren't told to believeit by some advertising campaign. It was earned. It was earned by year after year anddecade after decade of painstaking effort; a commitment to fundamental values; his beliefthat the American people were hungry for the truth, unvarnished and unaccompanied bytheatre or spectacle. He didn't believe in dumbing down. He trusted us. When he was told of this extraordinary honor that he was the most trusted man in America,he naturally downplayed it by saying the people had not polled his wife. When people of bothpolitical parties actually tried to recruit him to run for office, without even asking for hisstances on the issues, he said no -- to the relief of all potential opponents. And when, even adecade and a half after his retirement, he still ranked first in seven of eight categories fortelevision journalists, he was disbelieving that he hadn't won the eighth category,""attractiveness."" Through all the events that came to define the 20th century, through all our moments ofdeepest hurt and brightest hope, Walter Cronkite was there, telling the story of the Americanage. And this is how we remember him today. But we also remember and celebrate the journalismthat Walter practiced -- a standard of honesty and integrity and responsibility to which somany of you have committed your careers. It's a standard that's a little bit harder to findtoday. We know that this is a difficult time for journalism. Even as appetites for news andinformation grow, newsrooms are closing. Despite the big stories of our era, seriousjournalists find themselves all too often without a beat. Just as the news cycle has shrunk, sohas the bottom line. And too often, we fill that void with instant commentary and celebrity gossip and the softerstories that Walter disdained, rather than the hard news and investigative journalism hechampioned. ""What happened today?"" is replaced with ""Who won today?"" The public debatecheapens. The public trust falters. We fail to understand our world or one another as well aswe should    - and that has real consequences in our own lives and in the life of our nation. Weseem stuck with a choice between what cuts to our bottom line and what harms us as asociety. Which price is higher to pay? Which cost is harder to bear? ""This democracy,"" Walter said, ""cannot function without a reasonably well-informedelectorate."" That's why the honest, objective, meticulous reporting that so many of youpursue with the same zeal that Walter did is so vital to our democracy and our society: Ourfuture depends on it. Walter was no naive idealist. He understood the challenges and the pressures and thetemptations facing journalism in this new era. He believed that a media company has anobligation to pursue a profit, but also an obligation to invest a good chunk of that profit backinto news and public affairs. He was excited about all the stories that a high-tech world ofjournalism would be able to tell, and all the newly-emerging means with which to tell it. Naturally, we find ourselves wondering how he would have covered the monumental stories ofour time. In an era where the news that city hall is on fire can sweep around the world at thespeed of the Internet, would he still have called to double-check? Would he have been able to cut through the murky noise of the blogs and the tweets and thesound bites to shine the bright light on substance? Would he still offer the perspective thatwe value? Would he have been able to remain a singular figure in an age of dwindlingattention spans and omnipresent media? And somehow, we know that the answer is yes. The simple values Walter Cronkite set out inpursuit of -- to seek the truth, to keep us honest, to explore our world the best he could --they are as vital today as they ever were. Our American story continues. It needs to be told. And if we choose to live up to Walter'sexample, if we realize that the kind of journalism he embodied will not simply rekindle itself aspart of a natural cycle, but will come alive only if we stand up and demand it and resolve tovalue it once again, then I'm convinced that the choice between profit and progress is a falseone -- and that the golden days of journalism still lie ahead. Walter Cronkite invited a nation to believe in him -- and he never betrayed that trust. That'swhy so many of you entered the profession in the first place. That's why the standards he setfor journalists still stand. And that's why he loved and valued all of you, but we loved andvalued Walter not only as the rarest of men, but as an indispensable pillar of our society. He's reunited with his beloved Betsy now, watching the stories of this century unfold withboundless optimism -- every so often punctuating the air with a gleeful ""Oh, boy!"" We aregrateful to him for altering and illuminating our time, and for the opportunity he gave to us tosay that, yes, we, too, were there. Thank you very much.",obama
"Eight Septembers have come and gone. Nearly 3,000 days have passed -- almost one for each of thosetaken from us. But no turning of the seasons can diminish the pain and the loss of that day. No passage oftime and no dark skies can ever dull the meaning of this moment. So on this solemn day, at this sacred hour, once more we pause. Once more we pray -- as a nation and asa people; in city streets where our two towers were turned to ashes and dust; in a quiet field where a planefell from the sky; and here, where a single stone of this building is still blackened by the fires. We remember with reverence the lives we lost. We read their names. We press their photos to our hearts.And on this day that marks their death, we recall the beauty and meaning of their lives; men and women andchildren of every color and every creed, from across our nation and from more than 100 others. They wereinnocent. Harming no one, they went about their daily lives. Gone in a horrible instant, they now ""dwell in theHouse of the Lord forever."" We honor all those who gave their lives so that others might live, and all the survivors who battled burns andwounds and helped each other rebuild their lives; men and women who gave life to that most simple ofrules: I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper. We pay tribute to the service of a new generation -- young Americans raised in a time of peace and plentywho saw their nation in its hour of need and said, ""I choose to serve""; ""I will do my part."" And once more wegrieve. For you and your families, no words can ease the ache of your heart. No deeds can fill the emptyplaces in your homes. But on this day and all that follow, you may find solace in the memory of those youloved, and know that you have the unending support of the American people. Scripture teaches us a hard truth. The mountains may fall and the earth may give way; the flesh and theheart may fail. But after all our suffering, God and grace will ""restore you and make you strong, firm andsteadfast."" So it is -- so it has been for these families. So it must be for our nation. Let us renew our resolve against those who perpetrated this barbaric act and who plot against us still. Indefense of our nation we will never waver; in pursuit of al Qaeda and its extremist allies, we will never falter. Let us renew our commitment to all those who serve in our defense -- our courageous men and women inuniform and their families and all those who protect us here at home. Mindful that the work of protectingAmerica is never finished, we will do everything in our power to keep America safe. Let us renew the true spirit of that day. Not the human capacity for evil, but the human capacity for good.Not the desire to destroy, but the impulse to save, and to serve, and to build. On this first National Day ofService and Remembrance, we can summon once more that ordinary goodness of America -- to serve ourcommunities, to strengthen our country, and to better our world. Most of all, on a day when others sought to sap our confidence, let us renew our common purpose. Let usremember how we came together as one nation, as one people, as Americans, united not only in our grief,but in our resolve to stand with one another, to stand up for the country we all love. This may be the greatest lesson of this day, the strongest rebuke to those who attacked us, the highesttribute to those taken from us -- that such sense of purpose need not be a fleeting moment. It can be alasting virtue.For through their own lives -- and through you, the loved ones that they left behind -- the men and womenwho lost their lives eight years ago today leave a legacy that still shines brightly in the darkness, and thatcalls on all of us to be strong and firm and united. That is our calling today and in all the Septembers still tocome. May God bless you and comfort you. And may God bless the United States of America.",obama
"To the Fort Hood community; to Admiral Mullen; General Casey; General Cone; SecretaryMcHugh; Secretary Gates; most importantly, to family, friends, and members of our ArmedForces: We come together filled with sorrow for the 13 Americans that we have lost, withgratitude for the lives that they led, and with a determination to honor them through the workwe carry on. This is a time of war. Yet these Americans did not die on a foreign field of battle. They werekilled here, on American soil, in the heart of this great state and the heart of this greatAmerican community. This is the fact that makes the tragedy even more painful, even moreincomprehensible. For those families who have lost a loved one, no words can fill the void that's been left. Weknew these men and women as soldiers and caregivers. You knew them as mothers andfathers, sons and daughters, sisters and brothers. But here is what you must also know: Your loved ones endure through the life of our nation. Their memory will be honored in the places they lived and by the people they touched. Theirlife's work is our security, and the freedom that we all too often take for granted. Everyevening that the sun sets on a tranquil town; every dawn that a flag is unfurled; everymoment that an American enjoys life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness -- that is theirlegacy. Neither this country, nor the values upon which we were founded, could exist without menand women like these 13 Americans. And that is why we must pay tribute to their stories. Chief Warrant Officer Michael Cahill had served in the National Guard and worked as aphysician's assistant for decades. A husband and father of three, he was so committed to hispatients that on the day he died he was back at work just weeks after having had a heartattack. Major Libardo Eduardo Caraveo spoke little English when he came to America as ateenager. But he put himself through college, earned a Ph.D., and was helping combat unitscope with the stress of deployment. He's survived by his wife, sons, and step-daughters. Staff Sergeant Justin DeCrow joined the Army right after high school, married his high schoolsweetheart, and had served as a light wheeled mechanic and satellite communicationsoperator. He was known as an optimist, a mentor, and a loving husband and loving father. After retiring from the Army as a major, John Gaffaney cared for society's most vulnerableduring two decades as a psychiatric nurse. He spent three years trying to return to active dutyin this time of war, and he was preparing to deploy to Iraq as a captain. He leaves behind awife and son. Specialist Frederick Greene was a Tennessean who wanted to join the Army for a long time,and did so in 2008, with the support of his family. As a combat engineer he was a naturalleader, and he is survived by his wife and two daughters. Specialist Jason Hunt was also recently married, with three children to care for. He joined theArmy after high school. He did a tour in Iraq, and it was there that he reenlisted for six moreyears on his 21st birthday so that he could continue to serve. Staff Sergeant Amy Krueger was an athlete in high school, joined the Army shortly after 9/11,and had since returned home to speak to students about her experience. When her mothertold her she couldn't take on Osama bin Laden by herself, Amy replied: ""Watch me."" Private First Class Aaron Nemelka was an Eagle Scout who just recently signed up to do one ofthe most dangerous jobs in the service -- diffuse bombs -- so that he could help save lives. Hewas proudly carrying on a tradition of military service that runs deep within his family. Private First Class Michael Pearson loved his family and loved his music, and his goal was tobe a music teacher. He excelled at playing the guitar, and could create songs on the spot andshow others how to play. He joined the military a year ago, and was preparing for his firstdeployment. Captain Russell Seager worked as a nurse for the VA, helping veterans with Post-TraumaticStress. He had extraordinary respect for the military, and signed up to serve so that he couldhelp soldiers cope with the stress of combat and return to civilian life. He leaves behind a wifeand son. Private Francheska Velez, daughter of a father from Colombia and a Puerto Rican mother, hadrecently served in Korea and in Iraq, and was pursuing a career in the Army. When she waskilled she was pregnant with her first child, and was excited about becoming a mother. Lieutenant Colonel Juanita Warman was the daughter and granddaughter of Armyveterans. She was a single mom who put herself through college and graduate school, andserved as a nurse practitioner while raising her two daughters. She also left behind a lovinghusband. Private First Class Kham Xiong came to America from Thailand as a small child. He was ahusband and father who followed his brother into the military because his family had a stronghistory of service. He was preparing for his first deployment to Afghanistan. These men and women came from all parts of the country. Some had long careers in themilitary. Some had signed up to serve in the shadow of 9/11. Some had known intensecombat in Iraq and Afghanistan, and some cared for those did. Their lives speak to thestrength, the dignity, the decency of those who serve, and that's how they will beremembered. For that same spirit is embodied in the community here at Fort Hood, and in the manywounded who are still recovering. As was already mentioned, in those terrible minutes duringthe attack, soldiers made makeshift tourniquets out of their clothes. They braved gunfire toreach the wounded, and ferried them back to safety in the backs of cars and a pickup truck. One young soldier, Amber Bahr, was so intent on helping others, she did not realize for sometime that she, herself, had been shot in the back. Two police officers -- Mark Todd and KimMunley -- saved countless lives by risking their own. One medic -- Francisco de la Serna --treated both Officer Munley and the gunman who shot her. It may be hard to comprehend the twisted logic that led to this tragedy. But this much we doknow: No faith justifies these murderous and craven acts. No just and loving God looks uponthem with favor. For what he has done, we know that the killer will be met with justice -- inthis world, and the next. These are trying times for our country. In Afghanistan and Pakistan, the same extremists whokilled nearly 3,000 Americans continue to endanger America, our allies, and innocent Afghansand Pakistanis. In Iraq, we're working to bring a war to a successful end, as there are still those who woulddeny the Iraqi people the future that Americans and Iraqis have sacrificed so much for. As we face these challenges, the stories of those at Fort Hood reaffirm the core values that weare fighting for, and the strength that we must draw upon. Theirs are the tales of Americanmen and women answering an extraordinary call -- the call to serve their comrades, theircommunities, and their country. In an age of self -- selfishness, they embody responsibility. Inan era of division, they call upon us to come together. In a time of cynicism, they remind usof who we are as Americans. We are a nation that endures because of the courage of those who defend it. We saw thatvalor in those who braved bullets here at Fort Hood, just as surely as we see it in those whosigned up knowing they would serve in harm   s way. We are a nation of laws whose commitment to justice is so enduring that we would treat agunman and give him due process, just as surely as we will see that he pays for his crimes. We're a nation that guarantees the freedom to worship as one chooses. And instead ofclaiming God for our side, we remember Lincoln   s words, and always pray to be on the side ofGod. We're a nation that is dedicated to the proposition that all men and women are created equal. We live that truth within our military, and see it in the varied backgrounds of those we lay torest today. We defend that truth at home and abroad, and we know that Americans willalways be found on the side of liberty and equality. That's who we are as a people. Tomorrow is Veterans Day. It's a chance to pause, and to pay tribute -- for students to learnthe struggles that preceded them; for families to honor the service of parents andgrandparents; for citizens to reflect upon the sacrifices that have been made in pursuit of amore perfect union. For history is filled with heroes. You may remember the stories of a grandfather who marchedacross Europe; an uncle who fought in Vietnam; a sister who served in the Gulf. But as wehonor the many generations who have served, all of us -- every single American -- mustacknowledge that this generation has more than proved itself the equal of those who've comebefore. We need not look to the past for greatness, because it is before our very eyes. This generation of soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen have volunteeredin the time of certain danger. They are part of the finest fighting force that the world has everknown. They have served tour after tour of duty in distant, different, and difficult places. Theyhave stood watch in blinding deserts and on snowy mountains. They have extended the opportunity of self-government to peoples that have suffered tyrannyand war. They are men and women -- white, black, and brown -- of all faiths and all stations - - all Americans, serving together to protect our people, while giving others half a world awaythe chance to lead a better life. In today   s wars, there's not always a simple ceremony that signals our troops    success -- nosurrender papers to be signed, or capital to be claimed. But the measure of the impact ofthese young men and women is no less great. In a world of threats that no know borders,their legacy will be marked in the safety of our cities and towns, and the security andopportunity that's extended abroad. It will serve as testimony to the character of those whoserved, and the example that all of you in uniform set for America and for the world. Here at Fort Hood, we pay tribute to 13 men and women who were not able to escape thehorror of war, even in the comfort of home. Later today at Fort Lewis, one community willgather to remember so many in one Stryker Brigade who have fallen in Afghanistan. Long after they are laid to rest -- when the fighting has finished, and our nation has endured;when today   s servicemen and women are veterans and their children have grown -- it will besaid that this generation believed under the most trying of tests; believed in perseverance --not just when it was easy, but when it was hard; that they paid the price and bore the burdento secure this nation, and stood up for the values that live in the hearts of all free peoples. So we say goodbye to those who now belong to eternity. We press ahead in pursuit of the peace that guided their service. May God bless the memory of those that we have lost. And may God bless the United States of America.",obama
"To the United States Corps of Cadets, to the men and women of our armed services, and tomy fellow Americans: I want to speak to you tonight about our effort in Afghanistan -- thenature of our commitment there, the scope of our interests, and the strategy that myAdministration will pursue to bring this war to a successful conclusion. It's an extraordinaryhonor for me to do so here at West Point, where so many men and women have prepared tostand up for our security, and to represent what is finest about our country. To address these important issues, it's important to recall why America and our allies werecompelled to fight a war in Afghanistan in the first place. We did not ask for this fight. OnSeptember 11th, 2001, 19 men hijacked four airplanes and used them to murder nearly 3,000people. They struck at our military and economic nerve centers. They took the lives ofinnocent men, women, and children without regard to their faith or race or station. Were it notfor the heroic actions of passengers on board one of these flights, they could have also struckat one of the great symbols of our democracy in Washington, and killed many more. As we know, these men belonged to al Qaeda -- a group of extremists who have distorted anddefiled Islam, one of the world's great religions, to justify the slaughter of innocents. AlQaeda's base of operations was in Afghanistan, where they were harbored by the Taliban -- aruthless, repressive, and radical movement that seized control of that country after it wasravaged by years of Soviet occupation and civil war, and after the attention of America andour friends had turned elsewhere. Just days after 9/11, Congress authorized the use of force against al Qaeda and those whoharbored them -- an authorization that continues to this day. The vote in the Senate was 98to 0. The vote in the House was 420 to 1. For the first time in its history, the North AtlanticTreaty Organization invoked Article 5 -- the commitment that says an attack on one membernation is an attack on all. And the United Nations Security Council endorsed the use of allnecessary steps to respond to the 9/11 attacks. America, our allies, and the world were actingas one to destroy al Qaeda's terrorist network, and to protect our common security. Under the banner of this domestic unity and international legitimacy -- and only after theTaliban refused to turn over Osama bin Laden -- we sent our troops into Afghanistan. Within amatter of months, al Qaeda was scattered and many of its operatives were killed. The Talibanwas driven from power and pushed back on its heels. A place that had known decades of fearnow had reason to hope. At a conference convened by the UN, a provisional government wasestablished under President Hamid Karzai. And an International Security Assistance Force wasestablished to help bring a lasting peace to a war-torn country. Then, in early 2003, the decision was made to wage a second war in Iraq. The wrenchingdebate over the Iraq War is well-known and need not be repeated here. It's enough to saythat for the next six years, the Iraq War drew the dominant share of our troops, ourresources, our diplomacy, and our national attention -- and that the decision to go into Iraqcaused substantial rifts between America and much of the world. Today, after extraordinary costs, we are bringing the Iraq war to an responsible end. We willremove our combat brigades from Iraq by the end of next summer, and all of our troops bythe end of 2011. That we are doing so is a testament to the character of the men and womenin uniform. Thanks to their courage, grit, and perseverance, we have given Iraqis a chance toshape their future, and we are successfully leaving Iraq to its people. But while we have achieved hard-earned milestones in Iraq, the situation in Afghanistan hasdeteriorated. After escaping across the border into Pakistan in 2001 and 2002, al Qaeda'sleadership established a safe-haven there. Although a legitimate government was elected bythe Afghan people, it's been hampered by corruption, the drug trade, an under-developedeconomy, and insufficient security forces. Over the last several years, the Taliban hasmaintained common cause with al Qaeda, as they both seek an overthrow of the Afghangovernment. Gradually, the Taliban has begun to control additional swaths of territory inAfghanistan, while engaging in increasingly brazen and devastating attacks of terrorismagainst the Pakistani people. Now throughout this period, our troop levels in Afghanistan remained a fraction of what theywere in Iraq. When I took office, we had just over 32,000 Americans serving in Afghanistan,compared to 160,000 in Iraq at the peak of the war. Commanders in Afghanistan repeatedlyasked for support to deal with the reemergence of the Taliban, but these reinforcements didnot arrive. And that's why, shortly after taking office, I approved a long-standing request for moretroops. After consultations with our allies, I then announced a strategy recognizing thefundamental connection between our war effort in Afghanistan and the extremist safe-havensin Pakistan. I set a goal that was narrowly defined as disrupting, dismantling, and defeating alQaeda and its extremist allies, and pledged to better coordinate our military and civilian effort. Since then, we have made progress on some important objectives. High-ranking al Qaeda andTaliban leaders have been killed, and we've stepped up the pressure on al Qaeda world-wide.In Pakistan, that nation's Army has gone on its largest offensive in years. In Afghanistan, weand our allies prevented the Taliban from stopping a presidential election, and although it wasmarred by fraud, that election produced a government that is consistent with Afghanistan'slaws and Constitution. Yet huge challenges remain. Afghanistan is not lost, but for several years it has movedbackwards. There's no imminent threat of the government being overthrown, but the Talibanhas gained momentum. Al Qaeda has not reemerged in Afghanistan in the same numbers asbefore 9/11, but they retain their safe-havens along the border. And our forces lack the fullsupport they need to effectively train and partner with Afghan security forces and bettersecure the population. Our new Commander in Afghanistan, General McChrystal, has reportedthat the security situation is more serious than he anticipated. In short, the status quo is notsustainable. As cadets, you volunteered for service during this time of danger. Some of you fought inAfghanistan. Some of you will deploy there. As your Commander-in-Chief, I owe you a missionthat is clearly defined and worthy of your service. And that's why, after the Afghan voting wascompleted, I insisted on a thorough review of our strategy. Now let me be clear: There hasnever been an option before me that called for troop deployments before 2010. So there hasbeen no delay or denial of resources necessary for the conduct of the war during this reviewperiod. Instead, the review has allowed me ask the hard questions, and to explore all of thedifferent options along with my national security team, our military and civilian leadership inAfghanistan, and our key partners. Now given the stakes involved, I owed the Americanpeople, and our troops, no less. This review is now complete. And as Commander-in-Chief, I have determined that it is in ourvital national interest to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan. After 18months, our troops will begin to come home. These are the resources that we need to seizethe initiative, while building the Afghan capacity that can allow for a responsible transition ofour forces out of Afghanistan. I do not make this decision lightly. I opposed the war in Iraq precisely because I believe thatwe must exercise restraint in the use of military force, and always consider the long-termconsequences of our actions. We have been at war now for eight years, at enormous cost inlives and resources. Years of debate over Iraq and terrorism have left our unity on nationalsecurity issues in tatters and created a highly polarized and partisan backdrop for this effort. And having just experienced the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, theAmerican people are understandably focused on rebuilding our economy and putting people towork here at home. And most of all, I know that this decision asks even more of you -- a military that, along withyour families, has already borne the heaviest of all burdens. As President, I have signed aletter of condolence to the family of each American who gives their life in these wars. I haveread the letters from the parents and spouses of those who deployed. I've visited ourcourageous wounded warriors at Walter Reed. I've travelled to Dover to meet the flag-drapedcaskets of 18 Americans returning home to their final resting place. I see firsthand the terriblewages of war. If I did not think that the security of the United States and the safety of theAmerican people were at stake in Afghanistan, I would gladly order every single one of ourtroops home tomorrow. So no, I do not make this decision lightly. I make this decision because I am convinced thatour security is at stake in Afghanistan and Pakistan. This is the epicenter of violent extremismpracticed by al Qaeda. It is from here that we were attacked on 9/11, and it is from here thatnew attacks are being plotted as I speak. This is no idle danger, no hypothetical threat. In thelast few months alone, we have apprehended extremists within our borders who were senthere from the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan to commit new acts of terror. Andthis danger will only grow if the region slides backwards, and al Qaeda can operate withimpunity. We must keep the pressure on al Qaeda, and to do that we must increase thestability and capacity of our partners in the region. Of course this burden is not ours alone to bear. This is not just America's war. Since 9/11, alQaeda's safe-havens have been the source of attacks against London and Amman and Bali.The people and governments of both Afghanistan and Pakistan are endangered. And thestakes are even higher within a nuclear-armed Pakistan, because we know that al Qaeda andother extremists seek nuclear weapons, and we have every reason to believe that they woulduse them. These facts compel us to act along with our friends and allies. Our overarching goal remainsthe same: to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and toprevent its capacity to threaten America and our allies in the future. To meet that goal, we will pursue the following objectives within Afghanistan. We must denyal Qaeda a safe-haven. We must reverse the Taliban's momentum and deny it the ability tooverthrow the government. And we must strengthen the capacity of Afghanistan's securityforces and government, so that they can take lead responsibility for Afghanistan's future. We will meet these objectives in three ways. First, we will pursue a military strategy that willbreak the Taliban's momentum and increase Afghanistan's capacity over the next 18 months. The 30,000 additional troops that I'm announcing tonight will deploy in the first part of 2010 - - the fastest possible pace -- so that they can target the insurgency and secure key populationcenters. They'll increase our ability to train competent Afghan security forces, and to partnerwith them so that more Afghans can get into the fight. And they will help create the conditionsfor the United States to transfer responsibility to the Afghans. Because this is an international effort, I've asked that our commitment be joined bycontributions from our allies. Some have already provided additional troops, and we'reconfident that there will be further contributions in the days and weeks ahead. Our friendshave fought and bled and died alongside us in Afghanistan. And now we must come togetherto end this war successfully. For what's at stake is not simply a test of NATO's credibility;what's at stake is the security of our allies, and the common security of the world. Now taken together, these additional American and international troops will allow us toaccelerate handing over responsibility to Afghan forces, and allow us to begin the transfer ofour forces out of Afghanistan in July of 2011. Just as we have done in Iraq, we will executethis transition responsibly, taking into account conditions on the ground. We'll continue toadvise and assist Afghanistan's security forces to ensure that they can succeed over the longhaul. But it will be clear to the Afghan government -- and more importantly, to the Afghanpeople -- that they will ultimately be responsible for their own country. Second, we will work with our partners, the United Nations, and the Afghan people to pursuea more effective civilian strategy, so that the government can take advantage of improvedsecurity. This effort must be based on performance. The days of providing a blank check are over.President Karzai's inauguration speech sent the right message about moving in a newdirection. And going forward, we will be clear about what we expect from those who receiveour assistance. We'll support Afghan Ministries, governors, and local leaders that combatcorruption and deliver for the people. We expect those who are ineffective or corrupt to beheld accountable. And we will also focus our assistance in areas, such as agriculture, that canmake an immediate impact in the lives of the Afghan people. The people of Afghanistan have endured violence for decades. They've been confronted withoccupation by the Soviet Union, and then by foreign al Qaeda fighters who used Afghan landfor their own purposes. So tonight, I want the Afghan people to understand: America seeks anend to this era of war and suffering. We have no interest in occupying your country. We willsupport efforts by the Afghan government to open the door to those Taliban who abandonviolence and respect the human rights of their fellow citizens. And we will seek a partnership with Afghanistan grounded in mutual respect -- to isolate thosewho destroy, to strengthen those who build, to hasten the day when our troops will leave, andto forge a lasting friendship in which America is your partner, and never your patron. Third, we will act with the full recognition that our success in Afghanistan is inextricably linkedto our partnership with Pakistan. We're in Afghanistan to prevent a cancer from once again spreading through that country. Butthis same cancer has also taken root in the border region of Pakistan. And that's why we needa strategy that works on both sides of the border. In the past, there have been those in Pakistan who have argued that the struggle againstextremism is not their fight, and that Pakistan is better off doing little or seekingaccommodation with those who use violence. But in recent years, as innocents have beenkilled from Karachi to Islamabad, it has become clear that it is the Pakistani people who arethe most endangered by extremism. Public opinion has turned. The Pakistani Army has wagedan offensive in Swat and South Waziristan. And there is no doubt that the United States andPakistan share a common enemy. In the past, we too often defined our relationship with Pakistan narrowly. And those days areover. Moving forward, we are committed to a partnership with Pakistan that is built on afoundation of mutual interests, mutual respect, and mutual trust. We will strengthenPakistan's capacity to target those groups that threaten our countries, and have made it clearthat we cannot tolerate a safe-haven for terrorists whose location is known, and whoseintentions are clear. America is also providing substantial resources to support Pakistan'sdemocracy and development. We are the largest international supporter for those Pakistanisdisplaced by the fighting. And going forward, the Pakistani people must know: America willremain a strong supporter of Pakistan's security and prosperity long after the guns have fallensilent, so that the great potential of its people can be unleashed. These are the three core elements of our strategy: a military effort to create the conditions fora transition; a civilian surge that reinforces positive action; and an effective partnership withPakistan. I recognize that there are a range of concerns about our approach. So let me briefly address afew of the prominent arguments that I have heard, and which I take very seriously. First, there are those who suggest that Afghanistan is another Vietnam. They argue that itcannot be stabilized, and we're better off cutting our losses and rapidly withdrawing. I believethis argument depends upon a false reading of history. Unlike Vietnam, we are joined by abroad coalition of 43 nations that recognizes the legitimacy of our action. Unlike Vietnam, weare not facing a broad-based popular insurgency. And most importantly, unlike Vietnam, the American people were viciously attacked fromAfghanistan, and remain a target for those same extremists who are plotting along its border.To abandon this area now, and to rely only on efforts against al Qaeda from a distance, wouldsignificantly hamper our ability to keep the pressure on al Qaeda, and create an unacceptablerisk of additional attacks on our homeland and our allies. Second, there are those who acknowledge that we can't leave Afghanistan in its current state,but suggest that we go forward with the troops that we already have. But this would simplymaintain a status quo in which we muddle through, and permit a slow deterioration ofconditions there. It would ultimately prove more costly and prolong our stay in Afghanistan,because we would never be able to generate the conditions needed to train Afghan securityforces and give them the space to take over. Finally, there are those who oppose identifying a timeframe for our transition to Afghanresponsibility. Indeed, some call for a more dramatic and open-ended escalation of our wareffort -- one that would commit us to a nation building project of up to a decade. I reject thiscourse because it sets goals that are beyond what can be achieved at a reasonable cost, andwhat we need to achieve to secure our interests. Furthermore, the absence of a timeframe fortransition would deny us any sense of urgency in working with the Afghan government. Itmust be clear that Afghans will have to take responsibility for their security, and that Americahas no interest in fighting an endless war in Afghanistan. As President, I refuse to set goals that go beyond our responsibility, our means, or ourinterests. And I must weigh all of the challenges that our nation faces. I don't have the luxuryof committing to just one. Indeed, I'm mindful of the words of President Eisenhower, who -- indiscussing our national security -- said, ""Each proposal must be weighed in the light of abroader consideration: the need to maintain balance in and among national programs."" Over the past several years, we have lost that balance. We've failed to appreciate theconnection between our national security and our economy. In the wake of an economic crisis,too many of our neighbors and friends are out of work and struggle to pay the bills. Too manyAmericans are worried about the future facing our children. Meanwhile, competition within theglobal economy has grown more fierce. So we can't simply afford to ignore the price of thesewars. All told, by the time I took office the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan approached atrillion dollars. Going forward, I am committed to addressing these costs openly and honestly.Our new approach in Afghanistan is likely to cost us roughly 30 billion dollars for the militarythis year, and I'll work closely with Congress to address these costs as we work to bring downour deficit. But as we end the war in Iraq and transition to Afghan responsibility, we must rebuild ourstrength here at home. Our prosperity provides a foundation for our power. It pays for ourmilitary. It underwrites our diplomacy. It taps the potential of our people, and allowsinvestment in new industry. And it will allow us to compete in this century as successfully aswe did in the last. That's why our troop commitment in Afghanistan cannot be open-ended --because the nation that I am most interested in building is our own. Now let me be clear: None of this will be easy. The struggle against violent extremism will notbe finished quickly, and it extends well beyond Afghanistan and Pakistan. It will be anenduring test of our free society and our leadership in the world. And unlike the great powerconflicts and clear lines of division that defined the 20th century, our effort will involvedisorderly regions, failed states, diffuse enemies. So as a result, America will have to show our strength in the way that we end wars andprevent conflict -- not just how we wage wars. We'll have to be nimble and precise in our useof military power. Where al Qaeda and its allies attempt to establish a foothold -- whether inSomalia or Yemen or elsewhere -- they must be confronted by growing pressure and strongpartnerships. And we can't count on military might alone. We have to invest in our homeland security,because we can't capture or kill every violent extremist abroad. We have to improve andbetter coordinate our intelligence, so that we stay one step ahead of shadowy networks. We will have to take away the tools of mass destruction. And that's why I've made it a centralpillar of my foreign policy to secure loose nuclear materials from terrorists, to stop the spreadof nuclear weapons, and to pursue the goal of a world without them, because every nationmust understand that true security will never come from an endless race for ever-moredestructive weapons. True security will come for those who reject them. We will have to use diplomacy, because no one nation can meet the challenges of aninterconnected world acting alone. I've spent this year renewing our alliances and forging newpartnerships. And we have forged a new beginning between America and the Muslim World --one that recognizes our mutual interest in breaking a cycle of conflict, and that promises afuture in which those who kill innocents are isolated by those who stand up for peace andprosperity and human dignity. And finally, we must draw on the strength of our values. For the challenges that we face mayhave changed, but the things that we believe in must not. And that's why we must promoteour values by living them at home -- which is why I have prohibited torture and will close theprison at Guantanamo Bay. And we must make it clear to every man, woman, and childaround the world who lives under the dark cloud of tyranny that America will speak out onbehalf of their human rights, and tend to the light of freedom, and justice, and opportunity,and respect for the dignity of all peoples. That is who we are. That is the source, the moralsource of America's authority. Since the days of Franklin Roosevelt, and the service and sacrifice of our grandparents andgreat grandparents, our country has borne a special burden in global affairs. We have spilledAmerican blood in many countries on multiple continents. We have spent our revenue to helpothers rebuild from rubble and develop their own economies. We have joined with others todevelop an architecture of institutions from the United Nations to NATO to the World Bank thatprovide for the common security and prosperity of human beings. We have not always been thanked for these efforts, and we have at times made mistakes. Butmore than any other nation, the United States of America has underwritten global security forover six decades -- a time that, for all its problems, has seen walls come down, and marketsopen, and billions lifted from poverty, unparalleled scientific progress, and advancing frontiersof human liberty. For unlike the great powers of old, we have not sought world domination. Our union wasfounded in resistance to oppression. We do not seek to occupy other nations. We will notclaim another nation's resources or target other peoples because their faith or ethnicity isdifferent from ours. What we have fought for, and what we continue to fight for, is a betterfuture for our children and grandchildren, and we believe that their lives will be better ifothers [sic] peoples' children and grandchildren can live in freedom and access opportunity. As a country, we're not as young and perhaps not as innocent as we were when Rooseveltwas President. Yet we are still heirs to a noble struggle for freedom. And now we mustsummon all of our might and moral suasion to meet the challenges of a new age. In the end, our security and leadership does not come solely from the strength of our arms. Itderives from our people: from the workers and businesses who will rebuild our economy; fromthe entrepreneurs and researchers who will pioneer new industries; from the teachers that willeducate our children, and the service of those who work in our communities at home; fromthe diplomats and Peace Corps volunteers who spread hope abroad; and from the men andwomen in uniform who are part of an unbroken line of sacrifice that has made government ofthe people, by the people, and for the people a reality on this Earth.2 This vast and diverse citizenry will not always agree on every issue -- nor should we. But Ialso know that we, as a country, cannot sustain our leadership nor navigate the momentouschallenges of our time if we allow ourselves to be split asunder by the same rancor andcynicism and partisanship that has in recent times poisoned our national discourse. It's easy to forget that when this war began, we were united -- bound together by the freshmemory of a horrific attack, and by the determination to defend our homeland and the valueswe hold dear. I refuse to accept the notion that we cannot summon that unity again. I believe-- I believe with every fiber of my being that we, as Americans, can still come together behinda common purpose. For our values are not simply words written into parchment. They are acreed that calls us together, and that has carried us through the darkest of storms as onenation, as one people. America, we are passing through a time of great trial. And the message that we send in themidst of these storms must be clear: that our cause is just, our resolve unwavering. We willgo forward with the confidence that right makes might, and with the commitment to forge anAmerica that is safer, a world that is more secure, and a future that represents not thedeepest of fears but the highest of hopes. Thank you. God Bless you. And God Bless the United States of America.",obama
"As  many  of  you  know,  over  the  last  few  months  I've  been  thinking  hard  about  my  plans  for   2008.  Running  for  the  presidency  is  a  profound  decision        a  decision  no  one  should  make  on   the  basis  of  media  hype  or  personal  ambition  alone        and  so  before  I  committed  myself  and   my  family  to  this  race,  I  wanted  to  be  sure  that  this  was  right  for  us  and,  more  importantly,   right  for  the  country.   I  certainly  didn't  expect  to  find  myself  in  this  position  a  year  ago.  But  as  I've  spoken  to  many   of  you  in  my  travels  across  the  states  these  past  months,  as  I've  read  your  emails  and  read   your  letters,  I've  been  struck  by  how  hungry  we  all  are  for  a  different  kind  of  politics.  So  I've   spent  some  time  thinking  about  how  I  could  best  advance  the  cause  of  change  and  progress   that  we  so  desperately  need.   The  decisions  that  have  been  made  in  Washington  these  past  six  years,  and  the  problems  that   have  been  ignored,  have  put  our  country  in  a  precarious  place.  Our  economy  is  changing   rapidly,  and  that  means  profound  changes  for  working  people.  Many  of  you  have  shared  with   me  your  stories  about  skyrocketing  health  care  bills,  the  pensions  you've  lost  and  your   struggles  to  pay  for  college  for  your  kids.  Our  continued  dependence  on  oil  has  put  our   security  and  our  very  planet  at  risk.  And  we're  still  mired  in  a  tragic  and  costly  war  that  should   have  never  been  waged.   But  challenging  as  they  are,  it's  not  the  magnitude  of  our  problems  that  concerns  me  the   most.  It's  the  smallness  of  our  politics.  America's  faced  big  problems  before.  But  today,  our   leaders  in  Washington  seem  incapable  of  working  together  in  a  practical,  common  sense  way. Transcription  date  2010  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.  Copyright  Status:  Unknown   Page  1      Politics  has  become  so  bitter  and  partisan,  so  gummed  up  by  money  and  influence,  that  we   can't  tackle  the  big  problems  that  demand  solutions.  And  that's  what  we  have  to  change  first.   We  have  to  change  our  politics,  and  come  together  around  our  common  interests  and   concerns  as  Americans.   This  won't  happen  by  itself.  A  change  in  our  politics  can  only  come  from  you        from  people   across  our  country  who  believe  there's  a  better  way  and  are  willing  to  work  for  it.  Years  ago,   as  a  community  organizer  in  Chicago,  I  learned  that  meaningful  change  always  begins  at  the   grassroots,  and  that  engaged  citizens  working  together  can  accomplish  extraordinary  things.   So  even  in  the  midst  of  the  enormous  challenges  we  face  today,  I  have  great  faith  and  hope   about  the  future        because  I  believe  in  you.   And  that's  why  I  wanted  to  tell  you  first  that  I'll  be  filing  papers  today  to  create  a  presidential   exploratory  committee.  For  the  next  several  weeks,  I'm  going  to  talk  with  people  from  around   the  country,  listening  and  learning  more  about  the  challenges  we  face  as  a  nation,  the   opportunities  that  lie  before  us,  and  the  role  that  a  presidential  campaign  might  play  in   bringing  our  country  together.  And  on  February  10th,  at  the  end  of  these  discussions  and  in   my  home  state  of  Illinois,  I'll  share  my  plans  with  my  friends,  neighbors,  and  fellow   Americans.   In  the  meantime,  I  want  to  thank  all  of  you  for  your  time,  your  suggestions,  your   encouragement,  and  your  prayers.  And  I  look  forward  to  continuing  our  conversation  in  the   weeks  and  months  to  come. Transcription  date  2010  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.

"President Obama: Thank you. On behalf of Michelle and myself, welcome to the WhiteHouse. Little Child: Thank you. President Obama: Thank you. This a season of joy, tradition and celebration. Little Child: Yea! President Obama: Yes! And today, it is our great joy to continue a White House holidaytradition -- a celebration of performers who have transformed the arts in America, ourextraordinary Kennedy Center Honorees. We are joined by Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- members of Congress and members of the Kennedyfamily. I see sprinkled through the crowd some pretty fancy company, as well -- you've gotthe Queen of Soul. You've got Martin Scorsese -- he knows a little bit about film-making. Andmy spectacular First Lady is here, as well. I especially want to thank the man who created these Honors more than three decades agoand who has produced them ever since -- and whom I was proud to name as co-chair of thePresident's Committee on the Arts and Humanities -- George Stevens, Jr. George. And I want to also thank Stephen Schwarzman and the Kennedy Center trustees. As well aspresident Michael Kaiser and all those who sustain President Kennedy's vision of a ""greatstage"" celebrating ""the best coming from this country and abroad."" These performers are indeed the best. They are also living reminders of a simple truth -- andI'm going to steal a line from Michelle here -- the arts are not somehow apart from ournational life, the arts are at the heart of our national life. In times of war and sacrifice, the arts -- and these artists -- remind us to sing and to laughand to live. In times of plenty, they challenge our conscience and implore us to remember theleast among us. In moments of division or doubt, they compel us to see the common valuesthat we share; the ideals to which we aspire, even if we sometimes fall short. In days ofhardship, they renew our hope that brighter days are still ahead. So let's never forget that art strengthens America. And that's why we're making sure thatAmerica strengthens its arts. It's why we're reenergizing the National Endowment of theArts. That's why we're helping to sustain jobs in arts communities across the country. It'swhy we're supporting arts education in our schools, and why Michelle and I have hostedstudents here at the White House to experience the best of American poetry and music. And it's why we're honored to celebrate these five remarkable performers, who for decadeshave helped to sustain and strengthen the American spirit. You can't understand America without understanding jazz. And you can't understand jazz,without understanding Dave Brubeck. His mother was a classical pianist with high hopes forher son. And by the time he was four, he was playing himself. But by the time he was ateenager, he was tearing up local honky-tonks. Even his mother had to admit: ""There is somehope for David after all."" And perhaps it was World War II -- his service in Patton's Army -- that changed his sound,forcing him, as he said, to work the war out of his system by playing some ""pretty viciouspiano."" Whatever it was, his sound -- the distinctive harmonies and improvisations of theDave Brubeck Quartet -- would change jazz forever, prompting Time magazine to put him onthe cover as the leader of a new jazz age. Having brought jazz into the mainstream, he then transformed it, with innovative newrhythms on albums like Time Out -- the first jazz album to ever sell more than a millioncopies and still one of the best-selling jazz albums of all time. Dave Brubeck has never stopped reaching new audiences: Performing for Presidents fromJohnson to Reagan; composing orchestral tributes to Martin Luther King and Pope John PaulII; and even in his 80s, dazzling jazz festivals across America. And I know personally how powerful his performances can be. I mentioned this to Davebackstage. In the few weeks that I spent with my father as a child -- he came to visit me forabout a month when I was young -- one of the things he did was to take me to my first jazzconcert, in Honolulu, Hawaii, in 1971, and it was a Dave Brubeck concert. And I've been ajazz fan ever since. The world that he opened up for a 10-year-old boy was spectacular. And, Dave, for the joy that you've given millions of jazz lovers like me, for your six decades ofrevolutionary rhythms, you are rightly honored -- especially today, on your 89th birthday. He was born Melvin Kaminsky -- Mel Brooks: He never understood 4/4 time1 -- President Obama: He's still messing it up, Mel. Mel, I'm trying to say something nice aboutyou, now. Please don't upstage me. As you can tell, he was born to entertain. Or, as Mel Brooks explains it: ""Look at Jewishhistory -- unrelieved lamenting would be intolerable. So every 10 Jews, God designed one tobe crazy and amuse the others."" According to Mel, ""By the time I was five I knew I was thatone."" And by the time he was nine, this boy from Brooklyn had seen his first musical and dreamedof becoming ""the King of Broadway."" But World War II meant service in the Army -- or, as heput it, ""the European Theater of Operations"" with ""lots of operations"" and ""very little theater."" Returning home, he found success cranking out quips for Sid Ceasar -- or as Mel described hisreaction to success -- ""panic, hysteria, insomnia   and years of psychoanalysis."" That's right, we're reading back all your golden moments here, Mel. Unfortunately, many of the punch lines that have defined Mel Brooks' success cannot berepeated here. I was telling him that I went to see Blazing Saddles -- when I was 10. And hepointed out that I think, according to the ratings, I should not have been allowed in thetheater. That's true. I think I had a fake ID. But the statute of limitations has passed. Suffice it to say, in his satires and parodies, no cow is sacred, no genre is safe. He mockedthe musical -- and Hitler -- in The Producers, the western in Blazing Saddles, and the horrorfilm in Young Frankenstein. But behind all the insanity and absurdity, there's been a method to Mel's madness. He'sdescribed his work as ""unearthing the truth that is all around us."" And by illuminatinguncomfortable truths -- about racism and sexism and anti-Semitism -- he's been called ""ourjester, asking us to see ourselves as we really are, determined that we laugh ourselves sane."" For this, he is one of the few people ever to receive an Emmy and a Grammy and an Oscarand a Tony. Writer, director, actor, producer, composer   for his success -- and for hispsychoanalysis -- we honor Mel Brooks. Reflecting on the challenge of finding one's voice, Grace Bumbry once said: ""God has alreadyplanted that in your throat. It's your job to free it up, to allow that beautiful thing to shinethrough."" True to her name, Grace allowed her voice to shine through and touch all those within itsrange. Around her family's piano in St. Louis; on the talent show where, as a teenager, shemoved the host to tears; and then, after being turned away from one music school because ofthe color of her skin -- her triumphant international debut at the Paris Opera, when she wasjust 23 years old. With a pitch and presence like no other, she became a global sensation, moving audiences atthe great opera houses of the world. And performing here at the White House, it was saidthat she moved Jacqueline Kennedy to lean over and gently sing along the words to thePresident. Defying every expectation, Grace Bumbry then made the transition from mezzo to soprano. And over the decades that followed, she displayed a range like few others -- sometimes themiddle ranges as a mezzo; sometimes the highs of a soprano; sometimes both in the sameperformance. Grace not only triumphed in different techniques, she transformed them. And though she gave her final operatic performance in 1997, she appears in recitals to thisday. After nearly 50 years, she remains the definition of a diva in the classical sense: adivine voice worthy of the heavens. And tonight -- 32 years after she performed at the firstKennedy Center Honors for her mentor Marian Anderson -- we honor Grace Bumbry. Growing up in New York City's Little Italy, Bobby De Niro always knew what he wanted to be. Coming home from the movies, he'd act out the parts. At age 10, in his school play, he madea rather unlikely debut in The Wizard of Oz as the Cowardly Lion. He has said: ""my joy as an actor is to live different lives."" And in more than 60 filmsspanning more than 40 years, Robert De Niro has lived some of the most iconic and intensecharacters ever portrayed on film. A dying baseball player in Bang The Drum Slowly. Ayoung Vito Corleone in The Godfather Part II. A deranged Taxi Driver. A troubled veteran inThe Deer Hunter. A brutal boxer in Raging Bull. A vengeful ex-con in Cape Fear. Let's hopethat Martin Scorsese was kidding when he said that Robert is ""full of something that hewanted to express."" Don't worry, we did a vet on him before he came in tonight. But alongside his Oscar-winning emotional audacity there's his versatility, from a coma patientin Awakenings, to an ever-possessive father in Meet The Parents. There's his legendarymethod -- not simply portraying characters, but becoming them, emotionally and physically. And there is his love for his city -- whether it's directing films like A Bronx Tale, or foundingthe film center and festival that has energized the arts in New York City. It is perhaps the great irony of his life -- one of America's greatest cinematic actors is a man,famously, of few words off the screen -- and I can attest to this. So I'll simply say, thank you,Robert De Niro. Finally, we honor the quiet kid from Jersey -- who grew up to become the rock 'n' roll laureateof a generation. For in the life of our country only a handful of people have tapped the fullpower of music to tell the real American story -- with honesty; from the heart; and one ofthose people is Bruce Springsteen. He has said: ""I've always believed that people listen to your music not to find out about you,but to find out about themselves."" And for more than three decades, in his songs -- ofdreams and despair, of struggle and hope -- hardworking folks have seen themselves. They've seen their great state of New Jersey. And they've seen their America -- in songs thatbecome anthems. Restless kids who were ""Born to Run."" The struggles of workers in ""MyHometown."" The sacrifices of vets who were ""Born in the U.S.A."" Love and loss in ""Streets ofPhiladelphia."" A resilient nation in ""The Rising."" And, this year, a country ""Working on aDream."" It's no wonder that his tours are not so much concerts, but communions. There's a place foreverybody -- the sense that no matter who you are or what you do, everyone deserves theirshot at the American Dream; everybody deserves a little bit of dignity; everybody deserves tobe heard. I've seen it myself. Bruce was a great fan -- a great friend over the last year, and when Iwatched him on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial when he rocked the National Mall before myinauguration, I thought it captured as well as anything the spirit of what America should beabout. On a day like that, and today, I remember: I'm the President, but he's The Boss. And Bruce continues to inspire, along with his ""house-rocking, earth-shaking"" E Street Band. At 60 years old, he's still filling stadiums, still whipping fans into a frenzy, still surfing thecrowd, still jumping off pianos, and still reaching new fans, and still being nominated forGrammys. It's been a long road from that stage at Stone Pony in Asbury Park to this stagetoday, but this much we know -- after more than 30 years and 120 million albums sold, BruceSpringsteen is still one ""cool rockin' Daddy."" Dave Brubeck. Mel Brooks. Grace Bumbry. Robert De Niro. Bruce Springsteen. Theirstories are their own. But the part that they play in the larger American story -- that's whatwe honor here tonight. What they say is that with respect for the past, we can keep strongthe traditions and values that enrich us all; that with confidence in the present, and inourselves, we can overcome whatever comes our way; and that with faith in the future,America's greatest ""Glory Days"" are still to come. So thank you to all of our honorees. Thank you all very much for the joy and the beauty thatyou've contributed to our lives. We are very grateful. Thank you.",obama
"Thank you so much, Strobe, for your extraordinary leadership here at Brookings, and thanksto all of you in attendance. Almost exactly one year ago, on a frigid winter's day, I met with my new economic team atthe headquarters of my presidential transition offices in Chicago. And over the course of fourhours, my advisors presented an analysis of where the economy at that time stood,accompanied by a chilling set of charts and graphs, predicting where we might end up. It wasan unforgettable series of presentations. Christy Romer -- who's here today -- tapped to head the Council of Economic Advisers, as wellas Larry Summers, who I'd chosen to head the National Economic Council, described animminent downturn comparable in its severity to almost nothing since the 1930s. TimGeithner, my incoming Treasury Secretary, reported that the financial system, shaken by thesubprime crisis, had halted almost all lending, which in turn threatened to pull the broadereconomy in a downward spiral. Peter Orszag, my incoming Budget Director, closed out theproceedings with an entirely dismal report on the fiscal health of the country, with growingdeficits and debt stretching to the horizon. Having concluded that it was too late for me torequest a recount -- I tasked my team with mapping out a plan to tackle the crisis on allfronts. It wasn't long after that meeting, as we shaped this economic plan, that we began to seesome of these forecasts materialize. Over the previous year, it was obvious that folks werefacing hard times. As I traveled across the country during the long campaign, I would meetmen and women bearing the brunt of not only a deepening recession, but also years -- evendecades -- of growing strains on middle class families. But now the country was experiencingsomething far worse. Our gross domestic product -- the sum total of all that our economyproduces -- fell at the fastest rate in a quarter century. Five trillion dollars of Americans'household wealth evaporated in just 12 weeks as stocks, pensions, and home valuesplummeted. We were losing an average of 700,000 jobs each month, equivalent to thepopulation of the state of Vermont. That was true in December, January, February, March. The fear among economists across the political spectrum that was -- was that we were rapidlyplummeting towards a second Great Depression. So, in the weeks and months that followed, we undertook a series of difficult steps to preventthat outcome. And we were forced to take those steps largely without the help of anopposition party, which, unfortunately, after having presided over the decision-making thathad led to the crisis, decided to hand it over to others to solve. We acted to get lending flowing again so businesses could get loans to buy equipment, andordinary Americans could get financing to buy homes and cars, to go to college, and to startor run businesses. We enacted measures to stem the tide of foreclosures in our housingmarket, helping responsible homeowners stay in their homes and helping to stop the broaderdecline in home values which was eating away at what tends to be a family's largest asset. To achieve this, and to prevent economic collapse, we were forced to extend assistance tosome of the very banks and financial institutions whose actions had helped precipitate theturmoil. We also took steps to prevent the rapid dissolution of the American auto industry --which faced a crisis partly of its own making -- to prevent the loss of hundreds of thousandsof jobs during an already fragile, shaky time. These were not decisions that were popular orsatisfying; these were decisions that were necessary. Now, even as we worked to address the crises in our banking sector, in our housing market,and in our auto industry, we also began attacking our economic crisis on a broader front. Lessthan one month after taking office we enacted the most sweeping economic recovery packagein history: the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The Recovery Act was divided into three parts. One-third went for tax relief for smallbusinesses and 95 percent of working families. Another third was for emergency relief to helpfolks who've borne the brunt of this recession. We extended or increased unemploymentbenefits for more than 17 million Americans; made health insurance 65 percent cheaper forfamilies relying on COBRA. And for state and local governments facing historic budgetshortfalls as demand for services went up and revenues went down, we provided assistancethat has saved the jobs of hundreds of thousands of teachers and public school workers,firefighters and police officers. The last third of the Recovery Act is for investments to put Americans to work doing the workthat America needs done: doubling our capacity in renewable energy like wind and solar;computerizing medical records to save money and lives; providing the largest boost tomedical research in history; renovating classrooms and school laboratories; and upgradingroads and railways as part of the largest investment in infrastructure since the creation of theInterstate Highway System half a century ago. And even as the Recovery Act has created jobs and spurred growth, we have not let up in ourefforts to take every responsible action to get the economy growing and America working. This fall, I signed into law more than $30 billion in tax cuts for struggling businesses,extended an effective tax credit for homebuyers, and provided additional unemploymentinsurance for one million Americans. And the Treasury is continuing to adapt our financialstability plan, helping to facilitate the flow of small credit to small businesses and families. Inaddition, we're working to break down barriers and open overseas markets so our companiescan better compete globally, creating jobs in America by exporting our products around theworld. Now, partly as a result of these and other steps, we are in a very different place today thanwe were one year ago. We may forget, but we're in a very different place. We can safely saythat we are no longer facing the potential collapse of our financial system and we've avoidedthe depression many feared. Our economy is growing for the first time in a year, and theswing from contraction to expansion since the beginning of the year is the largest in nearlythree decades. Finally, we're no longer seeing the severe deterioration in the job market that we once were. In fact we learned on Friday that the unemployment rate fell slightly last month. This iswelcome news, and news made possible in part by the up to 1.6 million jobs that theRecovery Act has already created and saved according to the Congressional Budget Office. But I'm here today because our work is far from done. For even though we've reduced thedeluge of job losses to a relative trickle, we are not yet creating jobs at a pace to help allthose families who've been swept up in the flood. There are more than 7 million fewerAmericans with jobs today than when this recession began. That's a staggering figure, andone that reflects not only the depths of the hole from which we must ascend, but also acontinuing human tragedy. It was mentioned that I was in Allentown, Pennsylvania, this past weekend, and went to a jobcenter where people were engaged in job search. And it ran the spectrum -- blacks, whites,Hispanics, young people who were just starting their careers, individuals 50, 60 years old,looking for a job. And they were putting a brave face on it, confident that eventually thingswould work out, but you could also see the sense of anxiety, the fear that perhaps this time itwas different. Sometimes it's hard to break out of the bubble here in Washington and remind ourselves thatbehind these statistics are people's lives, their capacity to do right by their families. It speaksto an urgent need to accelerate job growth in the short term while laying a new foundation forlasting economic growth. My economic team has been considering a full range of additional ideas to help accelerate thepace of private sector hiring. We held a jobs forum at the White House that brought togethersmall business owners, CEOs, union members, economists, folks from non-profits, and stateand local officials to talk about job creation. And I've asked people to lead forums in theirown communities -- sending the results to me -- so we are hearing as many voices as possibleas we refine our proposals. We've already heard a number of good ideas, and I know we'lllearn of many more. So today, I want to outline some of the broader steps that I believe should be at the heart ofour effort to accelerate job growth -- those areas that will generate the greatest number ofjobs while generating the greatest value for our economy. First, we're proposing a series of steps to help small businesses grow and hire new staff. Overthe past 15 years, small businesses have created roughly 65 percent of all new jobs inAmerica. These are companies formed around kitchen tables in family meetings, formedwhen an entrepreneur takes a chance on a dream, formed when a worker decides it's time shebecame her own boss. These are also companies that drive innovation, producing 13 timesmore patents per employee than large companies. And it's worth remembering, every once ina while a small business becomes a big business -- and changes the world. That's why it's so important that we help small business struggling to stay open, or strugglingto open in the first place, during these difficult times. Building on the tax cuts in the RecoveryAct, we're proposing a complete elimination of capital gains taxes on small businessinvestment along with an extension of write-offs to encourage small businesses to expand inthe coming year. And I believe it's worthwhile to create a tax incentive to encourage smallbusinesses to add and keep employees, and I'm going to work with Congress to pass one. Now, these steps will help, but we also have to address the continuing struggle of smallbusinesses to get loans that they need to start up and grow. To that end, we're proposing towaive fees and increase the guarantees for SBA-backed loans. And I'm asking my TreasurySecretary to continue mobilizing the remaining TARP funds to facilitate lending to smallbusinesses. Second, we're proposing a boost in investment in the nation's infrastructure beyond what wasincluded in the Recovery Act, to continue modernizing our transportation and communicationsnetworks. These are needed public works that engage private sector companies, spurringhiring all across the country. Already, more than 10,000 of these projects have been funded through the Recovery Act. And by design, Recovery Act work on roads, bridges, water systems, Superfund sites,broadband networks, and clean energy projects will all be ramping up in the months ahead. Itwas planned this way for two reasons: so the impact would be felt over a two-year period;and, more importantly, because we wanted to do this right. The potential for abuse in a program of this magnitude, while operating at such a fast pace,was enormous. So I asked Vice President Biden and others to make sure to the extenthumanly possible that the investments were sound, the projects worthy, and the executionefficient. What this means is that we're going to see even more work -- and workers -- onrecovery projects in the next six months than we saw in the last six months. Even so, there are many more worthy projects than there were dollars to fund them. Irecognize that by their nature these projects often take time, and will therefore create jobsover time. But the need for jobs will also last beyond next year and the benefits of theseinvestments will last years beyond that. So adding to this initiative to rebuild America'sinfrastructure is the right thing to do. Third, I'm calling on Congress to consider a new program to provide incentives for consumerswho retrofit their homes to become more energy-efficient, which we know creates jobs, savesmoney for families, and reduces the pollution that threatens our environment. And I'mproposing that we expand select Recovery Act initiatives to promote energy efficiency andclean energy jobs which have been proven to be particularly popular and effective. It's a positive sign that many of these programs drew so many applicants for funding that alot of strong proposals -- proposals that will leverage private capital and create jobs quickly --did not make the cut. With additional resources, in areas like advanced manufacturing ofwind turbines and solar panels, for instance, we can help turn good ideas into good privatesector jobs. Finally, as we are moving forward in these areas, we should also extend the relief in theRecovery Act, including emergency assistance to seniors, unemployment insurance benefits,COBRA, and relief to states and localities to prevent layoffs. This will help folks weatheringthese storms, while boosting consumer spending and promoting job growth. Of course, there's only so much government can do. Job creation will ultimately depend on thereal job creators: businesses across America. We were encouraged today to hear from theBusiness Roundtable that their survey showed greater confidence and greater potentialinvestment coming out of the business community. Government can help lay the groundwork on which the private sector can better generatejobs, growth, and innovation. After all, small business tax relief is not a substitute foringenuity and industriousness by our entrepreneurs -- but it can help those with good ideas togrow and expand. Incentives to promote energy efficiency and clean energy manufacturing don't automaticallycreate jobs or lower carbon emissions -- but these steps provide a framework in whichcompanies can compete and innovate to create those jobs and reduce energy consumption. And while modernizing the physical and virtual networks that connect us will create private- sector jobs, they'll do so while making it possible for companies to more easily and effectivelymove their products across this country and around the world, and that will create more jobs. And given the challenges of accelerating the pace of hiring in the private sector, thesetargeted initiatives are right and they are needed. But with a fiscal crisis to match oureconomic crisis, we also must be prudent about how we fund it. So to help support theseefforts, we are going to wind down the Troubled Asset Relief Program -- or TARP -- the fundcreated to stabilize the financial system so banks would lend again. I don't think I have to tell you there has rarely been a less loved or more necessaryemergency program than TARP, which -- as galling as the assistance to banks may have been-- indisputably helped prevent a collapse of the entire financial system. Launched hastily --understandably, but hastily -- under the last administration, the TARP program was flawed,and we have worked hard to correct those flaws and manage it properly. And today, TARPhas served its original purpose and at much lower cost than we expected. In fact, because of our stewardship of this program, and the transparency and accountabilitywe put in place, TARP is expected to cost the taxpayers at least $200 billion less than whatwas anticipated just this past summer. And the assistance to banks, once thought to costtaxpayers untold billions, is on track to actually reap billions in profits for the taxpayingpublic. So this gives us a chance to pay down the deficit faster than we thought possible andto shift funds that would have gone to help the banks on Wall Street to help create jobs onMain Street. Small business, infrastructure, clean energy -- these are areas in which we can put Americansto work while putting our nation on a sturdier economic footing. That foundation for sustainedeconomic growth -- that must be our continuing focus and our ultimate goal. I've said this before. Even before this particular crisis, much of our growth for a decade ormore had been fueled by unsustainable consumer debt and reckless financial speculation,while we ignored the fundamental challenges that hold the key to our economic prosperity. We cannot simply go back to the way things used to be. We can't go back to an economy thatyielded cycle after cycle of speculative booms and painful busts. We can't continue to acceptan education system in which our students trail their peers in other countries, and a healthcare system in which exploding costs put our businesses at a competitive disadvantage. Andwe cannot continue to ignore the clean energy challenge or cede global leadership in theemerging industries of the 21st century. And that's why, even as we strive to meet the crisisof the moment, we have insisted on laying a new foundation for the future. Because an educated workforce is essential to a 21st century global economy, we've launcheda competitive Race to the Top fund through the Recovery Act to reform our schools and raiseachievement, especially in math and science. And we've made college more affordable,proposed a historic set of reforms and investments in community college, and set a goal ofonce again leading the world in producing college graduates by the year 2020. Because even the best-trained worker in the world can't compete if our businesses aresaddled with rapidly increasing health care costs, we are fighting to do what we havediscussed in this country for generations -- finally reforming our nation's broken healthinsurance system and relieving this unsustainable burden. Because our economic future depends on a financial system that encourages soundinvestments, honest dealings, and long-term growth, we've proposed the most ambitiousfinancial reforms since the Great Depression. We'll set and enforce clear rules of the road,close loopholes in oversight, charge a new agency with protecting consumers and address thedangerous, systemic risks that brought us to the brink of disaster. These reforms are movingthrough Congress, we're working to keep those reforms strong, and I'm looking forward tosigning them into law. And because our economic future depends on our leadership in the industries of the future, weare investing in basic applied research, and working to create the incentives to build a newclean energy economy. For we know the nation that leads in clean energy will be the nationthat leads the world. I want America to be that nation. I want America's prosperity to bepowered by what we invent and pioneer -- not just what we borrow and what we consume. And I know that we can and will be that nation if we are willing to do what it takes to getthere. Now, there are those who claim we have to choose between paying down our deficits on theone hand, and investing in job creation and economic growth on the other. This is a falsechoice. Ensuring that economic growth and job creation are strong and sustained is critical toensuring that we are increasing revenues and decreasing spending on things likeunemployment insurance so that our deficits will start coming down. At the same time,instilling confidence in our commitment to being fiscally prudent gives the private sector theconfidence to make long-term investments in our people and in America. So one of the central goals of this administration is restoring fiscal responsibility. Even as wehave had to spend our way out of this recession in the near term, we've begun to make thehard choices necessary to get our country on a more stable fiscal footing in the long run. Solet me just be clear here. Despite what some have claimed, the cost of the Recovery Act isonly a very small part of our current budget imbalance. In reality, the deficit had beenbuilding dramatically over the previous eight years. We have a structural gap between themoney going out and the money coming in. Folks passed tax cuts and expansive entitlement programs without paying for any of it -- evenas health care costs kept rising, year after year. As a result, the deficit had reached $1.3trillion when we walked into the White House. And I'd note: These budget-busting tax cutsand spending programs were approved by many of the same people who are now waxingpolitical about fiscal responsibility, while opposing our efforts to reduce deficits by gettinghealth care costs under control. It's a sight to see. The fact is we have refused to go along with business as usual; we are taking responsibilityfor every dollar we spend. We've done what some said was impossible: preventing wastefulspending on outdated weapons systems that even the Pentagon said it didn't want. We'vecombed the budget, cutting waste and excess wherever we could. I'm still committed tohalving the deficit we inherited by the end of my first term -- cutting it in half. And I made clear from day one that I would not sign a health insurance reform bill if it raisedthe deficit by one dime -- and neither the House, nor the Senate bill does. We've begun notonly changing policies in Washington, we've also begun to change the culture in Washington. In the end, the economic crisis of the past year was not just the result of weaknesses in oureconomy. It was also the result of weaknesses in our political system, because for decades,too many in Washington put off the hard decisions. For decades, we've watched as efforts tosolve tough problems have fallen prey to the bitterness of partisanship, to prosaic concerns ofpolitics, to ever-quickening news cycles, to endless campaigns focused on scoring pointsinstead of meeting our common challenges. We've seen the consequences of this failure of responsibility. The American people have paida heavy price. And the question we'll have to answer now is if we're going to learn from ourpast, or if -- even in the aftermath of disaster -- we're going to repeat those same mistakes. As the alarm bells fade, the din of Washington rises, as the forces of the status quo marshaltheir resources, we can be sure that answering this question will be a fight to the finish. But Ihave every hope and expectation that we can rise to this moment, that we can transcend thefailures of the past, that we can once again take responsibility for our future. Every night I read letters and e-mails sent to me from people across America -- ordinaryfolks, people who share their hopes and their hardships, their faith in this country, theirfrustration with what's happened in this economy. I hear from small business owners worriedabout making payroll, keeping their doors open. I hear from mothers and fathers, sons anddaughters, who've seen one or two or more family members out of work. The toughest lettersare in children's handwriting -- kids write to me, my dad just lost a job; my grandma is sick,she can't afford health insurance -- kids who can't just be kids because they're worried aboutmom having her hours cut or dad losing a job, or a family without health insurance. These folks aren't looking for a handout, they're not looking for a bailout -- just like thosepeople I visited in Allentown -- all they're looking for is a chance to make their own way, towork, to succeed using their talents and skills. And they're looking for folks in Washington tohave a seriousness of purpose that matches the reality of their struggle. Everywhere I've gone, every stop I've made, there are people like this, men and women whohave faced misfortune, but who stand ready to build a better future: students ready to learn,workers eager to work, scientists on the brink of discovery, entrepreneurs seeking the chanceto open a small business. Everywhere I go, there are once-shuttered factories just waiting towhir back to life in burgeoning industries. There is a nation ready to meet the challenges ofthis new age and to lead the world in this new century. And as we look back on the progressof the past year, and look forward to the work ahead, I have every confidence that we will doexactly that. These have been a tough two years. And there will no doubt be difficult months ahead. Butthe storms of the past are receding. The skies are brightening. And the horizon is beckoningonce more. Thank you very much.",obama
"Your  Majesties,  Your  Royal  Highnesses,  distinguished  members  of  the  Norwegian  Nobel   Committee,  citizens  of  America,  and  citizens  of  the  world:   I  receive  this  honor  with  deep  gratitude  and  great  humility.  It's  an  award  that  speaks  to  our   highest  aspirations        that  for  all  the  cruelty  and  hardship  of  our  world,  we  are  not  mere   prisoners  of  fate.  Our  actions  matter,  and  can  bend  history  in  the  direction  of  justice.   And  yet,  I  would  be  remiss  if  I  did  not  acknowledge  the  considerable  controversy  that  your   generous  decision  has  generated.  In  part,  this  is  because  I  am  at  the  beginning,  and  not  the   end,  of  my  labors  on  the  world  stage.  Compared  to  some  of  the  giants  of  history  who've   received  this  prize        Schweitzer  and  King,  Marshall  and  Mandela        my  accomplishments  are   slight.  And  then  there  are  the  men  and  women  around  the  world  who've  been  jailed  and   beaten  in  the  pursuit  of  justice    those  who  toil  in  humanitarian  organizations  to  relieve   suffering    the  unrecognized  millions  whose  quiet  acts  of  courage  and  compassion  inspire  even   the  most  hardened  cynics.  I  cannot  argue  with  those  who  find  these  men  and  women        some   known,  some  obscure  to  all  but  those  they  help        to  be  far  more  deserving  of  this  honor  than   I.   But  perhaps  the  most  profound  issue  surrounding  my  receipt  of  this  prize  is  the  fact  that  I  am   the  Commander  in  Chief  of  the  military  of  a  nation  in  the  midst  of  two  wars.  One  of  these   wars  is  winding  down.  The  other  is  a  conflict  that  America  did  not  seek,  one  in  which  we  are   joined  by  42  other  countries        including  Norway        in  an  effort  to  defend  ourselves  and  all   nations  from  further  attacks.   Still,  we  are  at  war.  And  I  am  responsible  for  the  deployment  of  thousands  of  young   Americans  to  battle  in  a  distant  land.  Some  will  kill    and  some  will  be  killed.  And  so  I  come   here  with  an  acute  sense  of  the  costs  of  armed  conflict        filled  with  difficult  questions  about   the  relationship  between  war  and  peace,  and  our  effort  to  replace  one  with  the  other. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Copyright  Status:  Restricted,  seek  permission.    2010   Page  1      Now  these  questions  are  not  new.  War,  in  one  form  or  another,  appeared  with  the  first   man.  At  the  dawn  of  history,  its  morality  was  not  questioned    it  was  simply  a  fact,  like   drought  or  disease        the  manner  in  which  tribes  and  then  civilizations  sought  power  and   settled  their  differences.   And  over  time,  as  codes  of  law  sought  to  control  violence  within  groups,  so  did  philosophers   and  clerics  and  statesmen  seek  to  regulate  the  destructive  power  of  war.  The  concept  of  a   ""just  war""  emerged,  suggesting  that  war  is  justified  only  when  certain  conditions  were  met:  if   it  is  waged  as  a  last  resort  or  in  self  defense    if  the  force  used  is  proportional    and  if,   whenever  possible,  civilians  are  spared  from  violence.   Of  course,  we  know  that  for  most  of  history,  this  concept  of  ""just  war""  was  rarely   observed.  The  capacity  of  human  beings  to  think  up  new  ways  to  kill  one  another  proved   inexhaustible,  as  did  our  capacity  to  exempt  from  mercy  those  who  look  different  or  pray  to  a   different  God.  Wars  between  armies  gave  way  to  wars  between  nations        total  wars  in  which   the  distinction  between  combatant  and  civilian  became  blurred.  In  the  span  of  30  years,  such   carnage  would  twice  engulf  this  continent.  And  while  it's  hard  to  conceive  of  a  cause  more  just   than  the  defeat  of  the  Third  Reich  and  the  Axis  powers,  World  War  II  was  a  conflict  in  which   the  total  number  of  civilians  who  died  exceeded  the  number  of  soldiers  who  perished.   In  the  wake  of  such  destruction,  and  with  the  advent  of  the  nuclear  age,  it  became  clear  to   victor  and  vanquished  alike  that  the  world  needed  institutions  to  prevent  another  world   war.  And  so  a  quarter  century  after  the  United  States  Senate  rejected  the  League  of  Nations           an  idea  for  which  Woodrow  Wilson  received  this  prize        America  led  the  world  in   constructing  an  architecture  to  keep  the  peace:  a  Marshall  Plan,  and  a  United  Nations     mechanisms  to  govern  the  waging  of  war,  treaties  to  protect  human  rights,  prevent  genocide,   restrict  the  most  dangerous  weapons.   In  many  ways,  these  efforts  succeeded.  Yes,  terrible  wars  have  been  fought,  and  atrocities   committed.  But  there  has  been  no  Third  World  War.  The  Cold  War  ended  with  jubilant  crowds   dismantling  a  wall.  Commerce  has  stitched  much  of  the  world  together.  Billions  have  been   lifted  from  poverty.  The  ideals  of  liberty  and  self  determination,  equality,  and  the  rule  of  law   have  haltingly  advanced.  We  are  the  heirs  of  the  fortitude  and  foresight  of  generations  past,   and  it  is  a  legacy  for  which  my  own  country  is  rightfully  proud.   And  yet,  a  decade  into  a  new  century,  this  old  architecture  is  buckling  under  the  weight  of   new  threats.  The  world  may  no  longer  shudder  at  the  prospect  of  war  between  two  nuclear   superpowers,  but  proliferation  may  increase  the  risk  of  catastrophe.  Terrorism  has  long  been  a   tactic,  but  modern  technology  allows  a  few  small  men  with  outsized  rage  to  murder  innocents   on  a  horrific  scale.   Moreover,  wars  between  nations  have  increasingly  given  way  to  wars  within  nations.  The   resurgence  of  ethnic  or  sectarian  conflicts    the  growth  of  secessionist  movements,   insurgencies,  and  failed  states        all  these  things  have  increasingly  trapped  civilians  in   unending  chaos.  In  today's  wars,  many  more  civilians  are  killed  than  soldiers    the  seeds  of   future  conflict  are  sown,  economies  are  wrecked,  civil  societies  torn  asunder,  refugees   amassed,  children  scarred.

What  I  do  know  is   that  meeting  these  challenges  will  require  the  same  vision,  hard  work,  and  persistence  of   those  men  and  women  who  acted  so  boldly  decades  ago.  And  it  will  require  us  to  think  in  new   ways  about  the  notions  of  ""just  war""  and  the  imperatives  of  a  just  peace.   We  must  begin  by  acknowledging  a  hard  truth:  We  will  not  eradicate  violent  conflict  in  our   lifetimes.  There  will  be  times  when  nations,  acting  individually  or  in  concert,  will  find  the  use   of  force  not  only  necessary  but  morally  justified.   I  make  this  statement  mindful  of  what  Martin  Luther  King  Jr.  said  in  this  same  ceremony   years  ago:  ""Violence  never  brings  permanent  peace.  It  solves  no  social  problem.  It  merely   creates  new  and  more  complicated  ones.""  As  someone  who  stands  here  as  a  direct   consequence  of  Dr.  King's  life  work,  I  am  living  testimony  to  the  moral  force  of  non  violence.  I   know  there's  nothing  weak,  nothing  passive,  nothing  na  ve  in  the  creed  and  lives  of  Gandhi   and  King.   But  as  a  head  of  state  sworn  to  protect  and  defend  my  nation,  I  cannot  be  guided  by  their   examples  alone.  I  face  the  world  as  it  is  and  cannot  stand  idle  in  the  face  of  threats  to  the   American  people.  For  make  no  mistake:  Evil  does  exist  in  the  world.  A  non  violent  movement   could  not  have  halted  Hitler's  armies.  Negotiations  cannot  convince  al  Qaeda's  leaders  to  lay   down  their  arms.  To  say  that  force  may  sometimes  be  necessary  is  not  a  call  to  cynicism.  It  is   a  recognition  of  history,  the  imperfections  of  man,  and  the  limits  of  reason.   I  raise  this  point,  I  begin  with  this  point  because  in  many  countries  there  is  a  deep   ambivalence  about  military  action  today        no  matter  what  the  cause.  And  at  times,  this  is   joined  by  a  reflexive  suspicion  of  America,  the  world's  sole  military  superpower.   Yet,  the  world  must  remember  that  it  was  not  simply  international  institutions        not  just   treaties  and  declarations        that  brought  stability  to  a  post  World  War  II  world.  Whatever   mistakes  we  have  made,  the  plain  fact  is  this:  The  United  States  of  America  has  helped   underwrite  global  security  for  more  than  six  decades  with  the  blood  of  our  citizens  and  the   strength  of  our  arms.   The  service  and  sacrifice  of  our  men  and  women  in  uniform  has   promoted  peace  and  prosperity  from  Germany  to  Korea,  and  enabled  democracy  to  take  hold   in  places  like  the  Balkans.  We  have  borne  this  burden  not  because  we  seek  to  impose  our   will.  We  have  done  so  out  of  enlightened  self  interest        because  we  seek  a  better  future  for   our  children  and  grandchildren,  and  we  believe  that  their  lives  will  be  better  if  others'  children   and  grandchildren  can  live  in  freedom  and  prosperity.   So  yes,  the  instruments  of  war  do  have  a  role  to  play  in  preserving  the  peace.  And  yet  this   truth  must  coexist  with  another:  that  no  matter  how  justified,  war  promises  human   tragedy.  The  soldier's  courage  and  sacrifice  is  full  of  glory        expressing  devotion  to  country,   to  cause,  to  comrades  in  arms.  But  war  itself  is  never  glorious    and  we  must  never  trumpet  it   as  such. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.

Concretely,  we   must  direct  our  effort  to  the  task  that  President  Kennedy  called  for  long  ago.  ""Let  us  focus,""   he  said,  ""on  a  more  practical,  more  attainable  peace,  based  not  on  a  sudden  revolution  in   human  nature  but  on  a  gradual  evolution  in  human  institutions.""   A  gradual  evolution  of  human  institutions.   What  might  this  evolution  look  like?   What  might  these  practical  steps  be?   To  begin  with,  I  believe  that  all  nations,  strong  and  weak  alike,  must  adhere  to  standards  that   govern  the  use  of  force.  I,  like  any  head  of  state,  reserve  the  right  to  act  unilaterally  if   necessary  to  defend  my  nation.  Nevertheless,  I  am  convinced  that  adhering  to  standards,   international  standards,  strengthens  those  who  do  and  isolates  and  weakens  those  who  don't.   The  world  rallied  around  America  after  the  9/11  attacks  and  continues  to  support  our  efforts  in   Afghanistan,  because  of  the  horror  of  those  senseless  attacks  and  the  recognized  principle  of   self  defense.  Likewise,  the  world  recognized  the  need  to  confront  Saddam  Hussein  when  he   invaded  Kuwait        a  consensus  that  sent  a  clear  message  to  all  about  the  cost  of  aggression.   Furthermore,  America        in  fact,  no  nation        can  insist  that  others  follow  the  rules  of  the  road   if  we  refuse  to  follow  them  ourselves.  For  when  we  don't,  our  actions  appear  arbitrary  and   undercut  the  legitimacy  of  future  interventions,  no  matter  how  justified.   And  this  becomes  particularly  important  when  the  purpose  of  military  action  extends  beyond   self  defense  or  the  defense  of  one  nation  against  an  aggressor.  More  and  more,  we  all   confront  difficult  questions  about  how  to  prevent  the  slaughter  of  civilians  by  their  own   government,  or  to  stop  a  civil  war  whose  violence  and  suffering  can  engulf  an  entire  region.   I  believe  that  force  can  be  justified  on  humanitarian  grounds,  as  it  was  in  the  Balkans,  or  in   other  places  that  have  been  scarred  by  war.  Inaction  tears  at  our  conscience  and  can  lead  to   more  costly  intervention  later.  That's  why  all  responsible  nations  must  embrace  the  role  that   militaries  with  a  clear  mandate  can  play  to  keep  the  peace.   America's  commitment  to  global  security  will  never  waver.  But  in  a  world  in  which  threats  are   more  diffuse  and  missions  more  complex  America  cannot  act  alone.  America  alone  cannot   secure  the  peace.  This  is  true  in  Afghanistan.  This  is  true  in  failed  states  like  Somalia,  where   terrorism  and  piracy  is  joined  by  famine  and  human  suffering.  And  sadly,  it  will  continue  to  be   true  in  unstable  regions  for  years  to  come.  The  leaders  and  soldiers  of  NATO  countries,  and   other  friends  and  allies,  demonstrate  this  truth  through  the  capacity  and  courage  they've   shown  in  Afghanistan.  But  in  many  countries,  there  is  a  disconnect  between  the  efforts  of   those  who  serve  and  the  ambivalence  of  the  broader  public. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Copyright  Status:  Restricted,  seek  permission.    2010   Page  4      I  understand  why  war  is  not  popular,  but  I  also  know  this:  The  belief  that  peace  is  desirable  is   rarely  enough  to  achieve  it.  Peace  requires  responsibility.  Peace  entails  sacrifice.   That's  why  NATO  continues  to  be  indispensable.  That's  why  we  must  strengthen  U.N.  and   regional  peacekeeping,  and  not  leave  the  task  to  a  few  countries.  That's  why  we  honor  those   who  return  home  from  peacekeeping  and  training  abroad  to  Oslo  and  Rome,  to  Ottawa  and   Sydney,  to  Dhaka  and  Kigali.  We  honor  them  not  as  makers  of  war,  but  as  wagers  of  peace.   Let  me  make  one  final  point  about  the  use  of  force.  Even  as  we  make  difficult  decisions  about   going  to  war,  we  must  also  think  clearly  about  how  we  fight  it.  The  Nobel  Committee   recognized  this  truth  in  awarding  its  first  prize  for  peace  to  Henry  Dunant        the  founder  of  the   Red  Cross,  and  a  driving  force  behind  the  Geneva  Conventions.   Where  force  is  necessary,  we  have  a  moral  and  strategic  interest  in  binding  ourselves  to   certain  rules  of  conduct.  And  even  as  we  confront  a  vicious  adversary  that  abides  by  no  rules,   I  believe  the  United  States  of  America  must  remain  a  standard  bearer  in  the  conduct  of  war.   That  is  what  makes  us  different  from  those  whom  we  fight.  That  is  a  source  of  our   strength.  That  is  why  I  prohibited  torture.  That  is  why  I  ordered  the  prison  at  Guantanamo   Bay  closed.  And  that  is  why  I  have  reaffirmed  America's  commitment  to  abide  by  the  Geneva   Conventions.  We  lose  ourselves  when  we  compromise  the  very  ideals  that  we  fight  to   defend.  And  we  honor  those  ideals  by  upholding  them  not  when  it's  easy,  but  when  it  is  hard.   I've  spoken  at  some  length  to  the  question  that  must  weigh  on  our  minds  and  our  hearts  as   we  choose  to  wage  war.  But  let  me  now  turn  to  our  effort  to  avoid  such  tragic  choices,  and   speak  of  three  ways  that  we  can  build  a  just  and  lasting  peace.   First,  in  dealing  with  those  nations  that  break  rules  and  laws,  I  believe  that  we  must  develop   alternatives  to  violence  that  are  tough  enough  to  actually  change  behavior.  For  if  we  want  a   lasting  peace,  then  the  words  of  the  international  community  must  mean  something.  Those   regimes  that  break  the  rules  must  be  held  accountable.  Sanctions  must  exact  a  real  price.   Intransigence  must  be  met  with  increased  pressure        and  such  pressure  exists  only  when  the   world  stands  together  as  one.   One  urgent  example  is  the  effort  to  prevent  the  spread  of  nuclear  weapons,  and  to  seek  a   world  without  them.  In  the  middle  of  the  last  century,  nations  agreed  to  be  bound  by  a  treaty   whose  bargain  is  clear:  All  will  have  access  to  peaceful  nuclear  power    those  without  nuclear   weapons  will  forsake  them    and  those  with  nuclear  weapons  will  work  towards  disarmament.  I   am  committed  to  upholding  this  treaty.  It  is  a  centerpiece  of  my  foreign  policy.  And  I'm   working  with  President  Medvedev  to  reduce  America  and  Russia's  nuclear  stockpiles.   But  it  is  also  incumbent  upon  all  of  us  to  insist  that  nations  like  Iran  and  North  Korea  do  not   game  the  system.  Those  who  claim  to  respect  international  law  cannot  avert  their  eyes  when   those  laws  are  flouted.  Those  who  care  for  their  own  security  cannot  ignore  the  danger  of  an   arms  race  in  the  Middle  East  or  East  Asia.  Those  who  seek  peace  cannot  stand  idly  by  as   nations  arm  themselves  for  nuclear  war. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Copyright  Status:  Restricted,  seek  permission.    2010   Page  5      The  same  principle  applies  to  those  who  violate  international  laws  by  brutalizing  their  own   people.  When  there  is  genocide  in  Darfur,  systematic  rape  in  Congo,  repression  in  Burma         there  must  be  consequences.  Yes,  there  will  be  engagement.  Yes,  there  will  be  diplomacy.  But   there  must  be  consequences  when  those  things  fail.  And  the  closer  we  stand  together,  the   less  likely  we  will  be  faced  with  the  choice  between  armed  intervention  and  complicity  in   oppression.   This  brings  me  to  a  second  point:  the  nature  of  the  peace  that  we  seek.  For  peace  is  not   merely  the  absence  of  visible  conflict.  Only  a  just  peace  based  on  the  inherent  rights  and   dignity  of  every  individual  can  truly  be  lasting.  It  was  this  insight  that  drove  drafters  of  the   Universal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights  after  the  Second  World  War.  In  the  wake  of   devastation,  they  recognized  that  if  human  rights  are  not  protected,  peace  is  a  hollow   promise.   And  yet,  too  often  these  words  are  ignored.  For  some  countries,  the  failure  to  uphold  human   rights  is  excused  by  the  false  suggestion  that  these  are  somehow  Western  principles,  foreign   to  local  cultures  or  stages  of  a  nation's  development.  And  within  America,  there's  long  been  a   tension  between  those  who  describe  themselves  as  realists  or  idealists        a  tension  that   suggests  a  stark  choice  between  the  narrow  pursuit  of  interests  or  an  endless  campaign  to   impose  our  values  around  the  world.   I  reject  these  choices.  I  believe  that  peace  is  unstable  where  citizens  are  denied  the  right  to   speak  freely  or  worship  as  they  please    choose  their  own  leaders  or  assemble  without  fear.   Pent  up  grievances  fester,  and  the  suppression  of  tribal  and  religious  identity  can  lead  to   violence.  We  also  know  that  the  opposite  is  true.  Only  when  Europe  became  free  did  it  finally   find  peace.  America  has  never  fought  a  war  against  a  democracy,  and  our  closest  friends  are   governments  that  protect  the  rights  of  their  citizens.  No  matter  how  callously  defined,  neither   America's  interests        nor  the  world's        are  served  by  the  denial  of  human  aspirations.   So  even  as  we  respect  the  unique  culture  and  traditions  of  different  countries,  America  will   always  be  a  voice  for  those  aspirations  that  are  universal.  We  will  bear  witness  to  the  quiet   dignity  of  reformers  like  Aung  Sang  Suu  Kyi,  to  the  bravery  of  Zimbabweans  who  cast  their   ballots  in  the  face  of  beatings,  to  the  hundreds  of  thousands  who  have  marched  silently   through  the  streets  of  Iran.  It  is  telling  that  the  leaders  of  these  governments  fear  the   aspirations  of  their  own  people  more  than  the  power  of  any  other  nation.  And  it  is  the   responsibility  of  all  free  people  and  free  nations  to  make  clear  that  these  movements  of  hope   and  history        they  have  us  on  their  side.   Let  me  also  say  this:  The  promotion  of  human  rights  cannot  be  about  exhortation  alone.  At   times,  it  must  be  coupled  with  painstaking  diplomacy.  I  know  that  engagement  with   repressive  regimes  lacks  the  satisfying  purity  of  indignation.  But  I  also  know  that  sanctions   without  outreach        condemnation  without  discussion        can  carry  forward  only  a  crippling   status  quo.  No  repressive  regime  can  move  down  a  new  path  unless  it  has  the  choice  of  an   open  door. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Copyright  Status:  Restricted,  seek  permission.    2010   Page  6      In  light  of  the  Cultural  Revolution's  horrors,  Nixon's  meeting  with  Mao  appeared  inexcusable         and  yet  it  surely  helped  set  China  on  a  path  where  millions  of  its  citizens  have  been  lifted  from   poverty  and  connected  to  open  societies.  Pope  John  Paul's  engagement  with  Poland  created   space  not  just  for  the  Catholic  Church,  but  for  labor  leaders  like  Lech  Walesa.  Ronald  Reagan's   efforts  on  arms  control  and  embrace  of  perestroika  not  only  improved  relations  with  the  Soviet   Union,  but  empowered  dissidents  throughout  Eastern  Europe.  There's  no  simple  formula  here.   But  we  must  try  as  best  we  can  to  balance  isolation  and  engagement,  pressure  and  incentives,   so  that  human  rights  and  dignity  are  advanced  over  time.   Third,  a  just  peace  includes  not  only  civil  and  political  rights        it  must  encompass  economic   security  and  opportunity.  For  true  peace  is  not  just  freedom  from  fear,  but  freedom  from   want.  It  is  undoubtedly  true  that  development  rarely  takes  root  without  security    it  is  also  true   that  security  does  not  exist  where  human  beings  do  not  have  access  to  enough  food,  or  clean   water,  or  the  medicine  and  shelter  they  need  to  survive.  It  does  not  exist  where  children  can't   aspire  to  a  decent  education  or  a  job  that  supports  a  family.  The  absence  of  hope  can  rot  a   society  from  within.   And  that's  why  helping  farmers  feed  their  own  people,  or  nations  educate  their  children  and   care  for  the  sick,  is  not  mere  charity.  It's  also  why  the  world  must  come  together  to  confront   climate  change.  There  is  little  scientific  dispute  that  if  we  do  nothing,  we  will  face  more   drought,  more  famine,  more  mass  displacement        all  of  which  will  fuel  more  conflict  for   decades.  For  this  reason,  it  is  not  merely  scientists  and  environmental  activists  who  call  for   swift  and  forceful  action.  It's  military  leaders  in  my  own  country  and  others  who  understand   our  common  security  hangs  in  the  balance.   Agreements  among  nations.  Strong  institutions.  Support  for  human  rights.  Investments  in   development.  All  these  are  vital  ingredients  in  bringing  about  the  evolution  that  President   Kennedy  spoke  about.  And  yet,  I  do  not  believe  that  we  will  have  the  will,  the  determination,   the  staying  power,  to  complete  this  work  without  something  more    and  that's  the  continued   expansion  of  our  moral  imagination        an  insistence  that  there's  something  irreducible  that  we   all  share.   As  the  world  grows  smaller,  you  might  think  it  would  be  easier  for  human  beings  to  recognize   how  similar  we  are        to  understand  that  we're  all  basically  seeking  the  same  things,  that  we   all  hope  for  the  chance  to  live  out  our  lives  with  some  measure  of  happiness  and  fulfillment  for   ourselves  and  our  families.   And  yet,  somehow,  given  the  dizzying  pace  of  globalization,  the  cultural  leveling  of  modernity,   it  perhaps  comes  as  no  surprise  that  people  fear  the  loss  of  what  they  cherish  in  their   particular  identities        their  race,  their  tribe,  and  perhaps  most  powerfully  their  religion.  In   some  places,  this  fear  has  led  to  conflict.  At  times,  it  even  feels  like  we're  moving  backwards.   We  see  it  in  the  Middle  East,  as  the  conflict  between  Arabs  and  Jews  seems  to  harden.  We  see   it  in  nations  that  are  torn  asunder  by  tribal  lines. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Copyright  Status:  Restricted,  seek  permission.    2010   Page  7      And  most  dangerously,  we  see  it  in  the  way  that  religion  is  used  to  justify  the  murder  of   innocents  by  those  who  have  distorted  and  defiled  the  great  religion  of  Islam,  and  who   attacked  my  country  from  Afghanistan.  These  extremists  are  not  the  first  to  kill  in  the  name  of   God.  The  cruelties  of  the  Crusades  are  amply  recorded.  But  they  remind  us  that  no  Holy  War   can  ever  be  a  just  war.  For  if  you  truly  believe  that  you  are  carrying  out  divine  will,  then  there   is  no  need  for  restraint        no  need  to  spare  the  pregnant  mother,  or  the  medic,  or  the  Red   Cross  worker,  or  even  a  person  of  one   s  own  faith.   Such  a  warped  view  of  religion  is  not  just  incompatible  with  the  concept  of  peace,  but  I   believe  it's  incompatible  with  the  very  purpose  of  faith:  For  the  one  rule  that  lies  at  the  heart   of  every  major  religion  is  that  we  do  unto  others  as  we  would  have  them  do  unto  us.  Adhering   to  this  law  of  love  has  always  been  the  core  struggle  of  human  nature.  For  we  are  fallible.  We   make  mistakes,  and  fall  victim  to  the  temptations  of  pride,  and  power,  and  sometimes  evil.   Even  those  of  us  with  the  best  of  intentions  will  at  times  fail  to  right  the  wrongs  before  us.   But  we  do  not  have  to  think  that  human  nature  is  perfect  for  us  to  still  believe  that  the  human   condition  can  be  perfected.  We  do  not  have  to  live  in  an  idealized  world  to  still  reach  for  those   ideals  that  will  make  it  a  better  place.  The  non  violence  practiced  by  men  like  Gandhi  and  King   may  not  have  been  practical  or  possible  in  every  circumstance,  but  the  love  that  they   preached        their  fundamental  faith  in  human  progress        that  must  always  be  the  North  Star   that  guides  us  on  our  journey.   For  if  we  lose  that  faith        if  we  dismiss  it  as  silly  or  na  ve    if  we  divorce  it  from  the  decisions   that  we  make  on  issues  of  war  and  peace        then  we  lose  what's  best  about  humanity.  We   lose  our  sense  of  possibility.  We  lose  our  moral  compass.   Like  generations  have  before  us,  we  must  reject  that  future.  As  Dr.  King  said  at  this  occasion   so  many  years  ago,  ""I  refuse  to  accept  despair  as  the  final  response  to  the  ambiguities  of   history.  I  refuse  to  accept  the  idea  that  the  'isness'  of  man's  present  condition  makes  him   morally  incapable  of  reaching  up  for  the  eternal  'oughtness'  that  forever  confronts  him.""  Let  us   reach  for  the  world  that  ought  to  be        that  spark  of  the  divine  that  still  stirs  within  each  of  our   souls.   Somewhere  today,  in  the  here  and  now,  in  the  world  as  it  is,  a  soldier  sees  he's  outgunned,   but  stands  firm  to  keep  the  peace.  Somewhere  today,  in  this  world,  a  young  protestor  awaits   the  brutality  of  her  government,  but  has  the  courage  to  march  on.  Somewhere  today,  a   mother  facing  punishing  poverty  still  takes  the  time  to  teach  her  child,  scrapes  together  what   few  coins  she  has  to  send  that  child  to  school        because  she  believes  that  a  cruel  world  still   has  a  place  for  that  child's  dreams.   Let  us  live  by  their  example.  We  can  acknowledge  that  oppression  will  always  be  with  us,  and   still  strive  for  justice.  We  can  admit  the  intractability  of  depravation,  and  still  strive  for   dignity.  Clear  eyed,  we  can  understand  that  there  will  be  war,  and  still  strive  for  peace.  We   can  do  that        for  that  is  the  story  of  human  progress    that's  the  hope  of  all  the  world    and  at   this  moment  of  challenge,  that  must  be  our  work  here  on  Earth.

"Good morning. It is an honor for me to join this distinguished group of leaders from nationsaround the world. We come here in Copenhagen because climate change poses a grave andgrowing danger to our people. All of you would not be here unless you -- like me -- wereconvinced that this danger is real. This is not fiction, it is science. Unchecked, climate changewill pose unacceptable risks to our security, our economies, and our planet. This much weknow. The question, then, before us is no longer the nature of the challenge. The question is ourcapacity to meet it. For while the reality of climate change is not in doubt, I have to behonest, as the world watches us today, I think our ability to take collective action is in doubtright now, and it hangs in the balance. I believe we can act boldly, and decisively, in the face of a common threat. That's why I comehere today -- not to talk, but to act. Now, as the world's largest economy and as the world's second largest emitter, America bearsour responsibility to address climate change, and we intend to meet that responsibility. That'swhy we've renewed our leadership within international climate change negotiations. That'swhy we've worked with other nations to phase out fossil fuel subsidies. That's why we've taken bold action at home -- by making historic investments in renewableenergy; by putting our people to work increasing efficiency in our homes and buildings; andby pursuing comprehensive legislation to transform to a clean energy economy. These mitigation actions are ambitious, and we are taking them not simply to meet globalresponsibilities. We are convinced, as some of you may be convinced, that changing the waywe produce and use energy is essential to America's economic future -- that it will createmillions of new jobs, power new industries, keep us competitive, and spark new innovation.We're convinced, for our own self-interest, that the way we use energy, changing it to a moreefficient fashion, is essential to our national security, because it helps to reduce ourdependence on foreign oil, and helps us deal with some of the dangers posed by climatechange. So I want this plenary session to understand, America is going to continue on this course ofaction to mitigate our emissions and to move towards a clean energy economy, no matterwhat happens here in Copenhagen. We think it is good for us, as well as good for the world.But we also believe that we will all be stronger, all be safer, all be more secure if we acttogether. That's why it is in our mutual interest to achieve a global accord in which we agreeto certain steps, and to hold each other accountable to certain commitments. After months of talk, after two weeks of negotiations, after innumerable side meetings,bilateral meetings, endless hours of discussion among negotiators, I believe that the pieces ofthat accord should now be clear. First, all major economies must put forward decisive national actions that will reduce theiremissions, and begin to turn the corner on climate change. I'm pleased that many of us havealready done so. Almost all the major economies have put forward legitimate targets,significant targets, ambitious targets. And I'm confident that America will fulfill thecommitments that we have made: cutting our emissions in the range of 17 percent by 2020,and by more than 80 percent by 2050 in line with final legislation. Second, we must have a mechanism to review whether we are keeping our commitments, andexchange this information in a transparent manner. These measures need not be intrusive, orinfringe upon sovereignty. They must, however, ensure that an accord is credible, and thatwe're living up to our obligations. Without such accountability, any agreement would be emptywords on a page. I don't know how you have an international agreement where we all are not sharinginformation and ensuring that we are meeting our commitments. That doesn't make sense. Itwould be a hollow victory. Number three, we must have financing that helps developing countries adapt, particularly theleast developed and most vulnerable countries to climate change. America will be a part offast-start funding that will ramp up to $10 billion by 2012. And yesterday, Secretary HillaryClinton, my Secretary of State, made it clear that we will engage in a global effort to mobilize$100 billion in financing by 2020, if -- and only if -- it is part of a broader accord that I havejust described. Mitigation. Transparency. Financing. It's a clear formula -- one that embraces the principle ofcommon but differentiated responses and respective capabilities. And it adds up to asignificant accord -- one that takes us farther than we have ever gone before as aninternational community. I just want to say to this plenary session that we are running short on time. And at this point,the question is whether we will move forward together or split apart, whether we preferposturing to action. I'm sure that many consider this an imperfect framework that I justdescribed. No country will get everything that it wants. There are those developing countriesthat want aid with no strings attached, and no obligations with respect to transparency. Theythink that the most advanced nations should pay a higher price. I understand that. There arethose advanced nations who think that developing countries either cannot absorb thisassistance, or that will not be held accountable effectively, and that the world's fastest- growing emitters should bear a greater share of the burden. We know the fault lines because we've been imprisoned by them for years. Theseinternational discussions have essentially taken place now for almost two decades, and wehave very little to show for it other than an increased acceleration of the climate changephenomenon. The time for talk is over. This is the bottom line: We can embrace this accord,take a substantial step forward, continue to refine it and build upon its foundation. We can dothat, and everyone who is in this room will be part of a historic endeavor -- one that makeslife better for our children and our grandchildren. Or we can choose delay, falling back into the same divisions that have stood in the way ofaction for years. And we will be back having the same stale arguments month after month,year after year, perhaps decade after decade, all while the danger of climate change growsuntil it is irreversible. Ladies and gentlemen, there is no time to waste. America has made our choice. We havecharted our course. We have made our commitments. We will do what we say. Now I believeit's the time for the nations and the people of the world to come together behind a commonpurpose. We are ready to get this done today -- but there has to be movement on all sides torecognize that it is better for us to act than to talk; it   s better for us to choose action overinaction; the future over the past -- and with courage and faith, I believe that we can meetour responsibility to our people, and the future of our planet. Thank you very much.",obama
"Good morning, everybody. I wanted to take just a few minutes to update the American peopleon the attempted terrorist attack that occurred on Christmas Day and the steps we're takingto ensure the safety and security of the country. The investigation's ongoing. And I spoke again this morning with Attorney General Eric Holder,the secretary of homeland security, Janet Napolitano, and my counterterrorism and homelandsecurity adviser, John Brennan. I asked them to keep -- continue monitoring the situation tokeep the American people and members of Congress informed. Now, here's what we know so far: On Christmas Day, Northwest Airlines Flight 253 was enroute from Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Detroit. As the plane made its final approach toDetroit Metropolitan Airport, a passenger allegedly tried to ignite an explosive device on hisbody, setting off a fire. Thanks to the quick and heroic actions of passengers and crew, thesuspect was immediately subdued, the fire was put out, and the plane landed safely. Thesuspect is now in custody and has been charged with attempting to destroy an aircraft. And afull investigation has been launched into this attempted act of terrorism, and we will not restuntil we find all who were involved and hold them accountable. Now, this was a serious reminder of the dangers that we face and the nature of those whothreaten our homeland. Had the suspect succeeded in bringing down that plane, it could havekilled nearly 300 passengers and crew, innocent civilians preparing to celebrate the holidayswith their families and friends. The American people should be assured that we are doingeverything in our power to keep you and your family safe and secure during this busy holidayseason. Since I was first notified of this incident, I've ordered the following actions to be taken toprotect the American people and to secure air travel. First, I directed that we take immediate steps to ensure the safety of the traveling public. Wemade sure that all flights still in the air were secure and could land safely. We immediatelyenhanced screening and security procedures for all flights, domestic and international. Weadded federal air marshals to flights entering and leaving the United States. And we'reworking closely in this country, federal, state and local law enforcement, with our internationalpartners. Second, I've ordered two important reviews, because it's absolutely critical that we learn fromthis incident and take the necessary measures to prevent future acts of terrorism. The first review involves our watch list system, which our government has had in place formany years to identify known and suspected terrorists so that we can prevent their entry intothe United States. Apparently the suspect in the Christmas incident was in this system, butnot on a watch list, such as the so-called no-fly list. So I have ordered a thorough review, notonly of how information related to the subject was handled, but of the overall watch listsystem and how it can be strengthened. The second review will examine all screening policies, technologies, and procedures related toair travel. We need to determine just how the suspect was able to bring dangerous explosivesaboard an aircraft and what additional steps we can take to thwart future attacks. Third, I've directed my national security team to keep up the pressure on those who wouldattack our country. We do not yet have all the answers about this latest attempt, but thosewho would slaughter innocent men, women, and children must know that the United Stateswill more -- do more than simply strengthen our defenses. We will continue to use everyelement of our national power to disrupt, to dismantle, and defeat the violent extremists whothreaten us, whether they are from Afghanistan or Pakistan, Yemen or Somalia, or anywherewhere they are plotting attacks against the U.S. homeland. Finally, the American people should remain vigilant, but also be confident. Those plottingagainst us seek not only to undermine our security, but also the open society and the valuesthat we cherish as Americans. This incident, like several that have preceded it, demonstratesthat an alert and courageous citizenry are far more resilient than an isolated extremist. As a nation, we will do everything in our power to protect our country. As Americans, we willnever give in to fear or division. We will be guided by our hopes, our unity, and our deeplyheld values. That's who we are as Americans. That's what our brave men and women in uniform are standing up for as they spend theholidays in harm's way. And we will continue to do everything that we can to keep America safe in the new year andbeyond. Before I leave, let me also briefly address the events that have taken place over the last fewdays in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The United States joins with the international communityin strongly condemning the violent and unjust suppression of innocent Iranian citizens, whichhas apparently resulted in detentions, injuries, and even death. For months, the Iranian people have sought nothing more than to exercise their universalrights. Each time they have done so, they have been met with the iron fist of brutality, evenon solemn occasions and holy days. And each time that has happened, the world has watchedwith deep admiration for the courage and the conviction of the Iranian people who are part ofIran's great and enduring civilization. What's taking place within Iran is not about the United States or any other country. It's aboutthe Iranian people and their aspirations for justice and a better life for themselves. And thedecision of Iran's leaders to govern through fear and tyranny will not succeed in making thoseaspirations go away. As I said in Oslo, it's telling when governments fear the aspirations [of] their own people morethan the power of any other nation. Along with all free nations, the United States stands with those who seek their universalrights. We call upon the Iranian government to abide by the international obligations that ithas to respect the rights of its own people. We call for the immediate release of all who have been unjustly detained within Iran. We will continue to bear witness to the extraordinary events that are taking place there. AndI'm confident that history will be on the side of those who seek justice. Thank you very much, everybody. And happy New Year.",obama
"I just concluded a meeting with members of my national security team, including those fromour intelligence, homeland security and law enforcement agencies involved in the securityreviews that I ordered after the failed attack on Christmas Day. I called these leaders to the White House because we face a challenge of the utmosturgency. As we saw on Christmas, al Qaeda and its extremist allies will stop at nothing in theirefforts to kill Americans. And we are determined not only to thwart those plans, but todisrupt, dismantle and defeat their networks once and for all. Indeed, over the past year, we've taken the fight to al Qaeda and its allies wherever they plotand train, be it in Afghanistan and Pakistan, in Yemen and Somalia, or in other countriesaround the world. Here at home, our intelligence, homeland security and law enforcement agencies have workedtogether with considerable success: gathering intelligence, stitching it together, and makingarrests -- from Denver to Texas, from Illinois to New York -- disrupting plots and savingAmerican lives. And these successes have not come without a price, as we saw last week inthe loss of our courageous CIA officers in Afghanistan. But when a suspected terrorist is able to board a plane with explosives on Christmas Day thesystem has failed in a potentially disastrous way. And it's my responsibility to find out why,and to correct that failure so that we can prevent such attacks in the future. And that's why, shortly after the attempted bombing over Detroit, I ordered two reviews. Idirected Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano to review aviation screening,technology and procedures. She briefed me on her initial findings today, and I'm pleased thatthis review is drawing on the best science and technology, including the expertise of Secretaryof Energy Steven Chu and his department. I also directed my counterterrorism and homeland security advisor John Brennan to lead athorough review into our terrorist watch-listing system so we can fix what went wrong. As wediscussed today, this ongoing review continues to reveal more about the human and systemicfailures that almost cost nearly 300 lives. We will make a summary of this preliminary reportpublic within the next few days, but let me share some of what we know so far. As I described over the weekend, elements of our intelligence community knew that UmarFarouk Abdulmutallab had traveled to Yemen and joined up with extremists there. It nowturns out that our intelligence community knew of other red flags -- that al Qaeda in theArabian Peninsula sought to strike not only American targets in Yemen, but the United Statesitself. And we had information that this group was working with an individual who was known-- who we now know was in fact the individual involved in the Christmas attack. The bottom line is this: The U.S. government had sufficient information to have uncoveredthis plot and potentially disrupt the Christmas Day attack. But our intelligence communityfailed to connect those dots, which would have placed the suspect on the ""no fly"" list. In otherwords, this was not a failure to collect intelligence; it was a failure to integrate andunderstand the intelligence that we already had. The information was there. Agencies andanalysts who needed it had access to it. And our professionals were trained to look for it andto bring it all together. Now, I will accept that intelligence, by its nature, is imperfect, but it is increasingly clear thatintelligence was not fully analyzed or fully leveraged. That's not acceptable, and I will nottolerate it. Time and again, we've learned that quickly piecing together information andtaking swift action is critical to staying one step ahead of a nimble adversary. So we have to do better -- and we will do better. And we have to do it quickly. Americanlives are on the line. So I made it clear today to my team: I want our initial reviewscompleted this week. I want specific recommendations for corrective actions to fix what wentwrong. I want those reforms implemented immediately, so that this doesn't happen againand so we can prevent future attacks. And I know that every member of my team that I metwith today understands the urgency of getting this right. And I appreciate that each of themtook responsibility for the shortfalls within their own agencies. Immediately after the attack, I ordered concrete steps to protect the American people: newscreening and security for all flights, domestic and international; more explosive detectionteams at airports; more air marshals on flights; and deepening cooperation with internationalpartners. In recent days, we've taken additional steps to improve security. Counterterrorism officialshave reviewed and updated our terrorist watch list system, including adding more individualsto the ""no fly"" list. And while our review has found that our watch-listing system is notbroken, the failure to add Abdulmutallab to the ""no fly"" list shows that this system needs to bestrengthened. The State Department is now requiring embassies and consulates to include current visainformation in their warning on individuals with terrorist or suspected terrorist connections. As of yesterday, the Transportation Security Administration, or TSA, is requiring enhancedscreening for passengers flying into the United States from, or flying through, nations on ourlist of state sponsors of terrorism, or other countries of interest. And in the days ahead, I willannounce further steps to disrupt attacks, including better integration of information andenhanced passenger screening for air travel. Finally, some have suggested that the events on Christmas Day should cause us to revisit thedecision to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. So let me be clear. It was always our intentto transfer detainees to other countries only under conditions that provide assurances that oursecurity is being protected. With respect to Yemen in particular, there's an ongoing security situation which we have beenconfronting for some time, along with our Yemeni partner. Given the unsettled situation, I'vespoken to the Attorney General and we've agreed that we will not be transferring additionaldetainees back to Yemen at this time. But make no mistake: We will close Guantanamo prison, which has damaged our nationalsecurity interests and become a tremendous recruiting tool for al Qaeda. In fact, that was anexplicit rationale for the formation of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. And, as I've alwayssaid, we will do so -- we will close the prison in a manner that keeps the American people safeand secure. Our reviews -- and the steps that we've taken and will continue to take -- go to the heart ofthe kind of intelligence and homeland security we need in the 21st century. Just as al Qaedaand its allies are constantly evolving and adapting their efforts to strike us, we have toconstantly adapt and evolve to defeat them, because as we saw on Christmas, the margin forerror is slim and the consequences of failure can be catastrophic. As these violent extremists pursue new havens, we intend to target al Qaeda wherever theytake root, forging new partnerships to deny them sanctuary, as we are doing currently withthe government in Yemen. As our adversaries seek new recruits, we'll constantly review andrapidly update our intelligence and our institutions. As they refine our tactics, we'll enhanceour defenses, including smarter screening and security at airports, and investing in thetechnologies that might have detected the kind of explosives used on Christmas. In short, we need our intelligence, homeland security and law enforcement systems -- and thepeople in them -- to be accountable and to work as intended: collecting, sharing, integrating,analyzing, and acting on intelligence as quickly and effectively as possible to save innocentlives -- not just most of the time, but all the time. That's what the American people deserve. As President, that's exactly what I will demand. Thank you very much.",obama
"Good afternoon, everybody. The immediate reviews that I ordered after the failed Christmasterrorist attack are now complete. I was just briefed on the findings and recommendations forreform, and I believe it's important that the American people understand the new steps thatwe're taking to prevent attacks and keep our country safe. This afternoon, my Counterterrorism and Homeland Security Advisor, John Brennan, willdiscuss his review into our terrorist watchlist system -- how our government failed to connectthe dots in a way that would have prevented a known terrorist from boarding a plane forAmerica, and the steps we're going to take to prevent that from happening again. Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano will discuss her review of aviation screening,technology and procedures -- how that terrorist boarded a plane with explosives that couldhave killed nearly 300 innocent people, and how we'll strengthen aviation security goingforward. So today I want to just briefly summarize their conclusions and the steps that I've ordered toaddress them. In our ever-changing world, America's first line of defense is timely, accurate intelligence thatis shared, integrated, analyzed, and acted upon quickly and effectively. That's what theintelligence reforms after the 9/11 attacks largely achieved. That's what our intelligencecommunity does every day. But, unfortunately, that's not what happened in the lead-up toChristmas Day. It's now clear that shortcomings occurred in three broad and compoundingways. First, although our intelligence community had learned a great deal about the al Qaedaaffiliate in Yemen -- called al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula -- that we knew that they soughtto strike the United States and that they were recruiting operatives to do so -- the intelligencecommunity did not aggressively follow up on and prioritize particular streams of intelligencerelated to a possible attack against the homeland. Second, this contributed to a larger failure of analysis -- a failure to connect the dots ofintelligence that existed across our intelligence community and which, together, could haverevealed that Abdulmutallab was planning an attack. Third, this, in turn, fed into shortcomings in the watch-listing system which resulted in thisperson not being placed on the ""no fly"" list, thereby allowing him to board that plane inAmsterdam for Detroit. In sum, the U.S. government had the information -- scattered throughout the system -- topotentially uncover this plot and disrupt the attack. Rather than a failure to collect or shareintelligence, this was a failure to connect and understand the intelligence that we already had. That's why we took swift action in the immediate days following Christmas, includingreviewing and updating the terrorist watchlist system and adding more individuals to the ""nofly"" list, and directing our embassies and consulates to include current visa information in theirwarnings of individuals with terrorist or suspected terrorist ties. Today, I'm directing a series of additional corrective steps across multiple agencies. Broadlyspeaking, they fall into four areas. First, I'm directing that our intelligence community immediately begin assigning specificresponsibility for investigating all leads on high-priority threats so that these leads arepursued and acted upon aggressively -- not just most of the time, but all of the time. Wemust follow the leads that we get. And we must pursue them until plots are disrupted. Andthat mean assigning clear lines of responsibility. Second, I'm directing that intelligence reports, especially those involving potential threats tothe United States, be distributed more rapidly and more widely. We can't sit on informationthat could protect the American people. Third, I'm directing that we strengthen the analytical process, how our analysis -- how ouranalysts process and integrate the intelligence that they receive. My Director of NationalIntelligence, Denny Blair, will take the lead in improving our day-to-day efforts. MyIntelligence Advisory Board will examine the longer-term challenge of sifting through vastuniverses of intelligence and data in our Information Age. And finally, I'm ordering an immediate effort to strengthen the criteria used to add individualsto our terrorist watchlists, especially the ""no fly"" list. We must do better in keeping dangerouspeople off airplanes, while still facilitating air travel. So taken together, these reforms will improve the intelligence community's ability to collect,share, integrate, analyze, and act on intelligence swiftly and effectively. In short, they willhelp our intelligence community do its job even better and protect American lives. But even the best intelligence can't identify in advance every individual who would do usharm. So we need the security -- at our airports, ports, and borders, and through ourpartnerships with other nations -- to prevent terrorists from entering America. At the Amsterdam airport, Abdulmutallab was subjected to the same screening as otherpassengers. He was required to show his documents -- including a valid U.S. visa. His carry- on bag was X-rayed. He passed through a metal detector. But a metal detector can't detectthe kind of explosives that were sewn into his clothes. As Secretary Napolitano will explain, the screening technologies that might have detectedthese explosives are in use at the Amsterdam airport, but not at the specific checkpoints thathe passed through. Indeed, most airports in the world -- and in the United States -- do notyet have these technologies. Now, there's no silver bullet to securing the thousands of flightsinto America each day, domestic and international. It will require significant investments inmany areas. And that's why, even before the Christmas attack, we increased investments inhomeland security and aviation security. This includes an additional one billion dollars in newsystems and technologies that we need to protect our airports -- more baggage screening,more passenger screening and more advanced explosive detection capabilities, including thosethat can improve our ability to detect the kind of explosive used on Christmas. These aremajor investments and they'll make our skies safer and more secure. As I announced this week, we've taken a whole range of steps to improve aviation screeningand security since Christmas, including new rules for how we handle visas within thegovernment and enhanced screening for passengers flying from, or through, certaincountries. And today, I'm directing that the Department of Homeland Security take additional steps,including: strengthening our international partnerships to improve aviation screening andsecurity around the world; greater use of the advanced explosive detection technologies thatwe already have, including imaging technology; and working aggressively, in cooperation with the Department of Energy and our National Labs, to develop and deploy the next generationof screening technologies. Now, there is, of course, no foolproof solution. As we develop new screening technologies andprocedures, our adversaries will seek new ways to evade them, as was shown by theChristmas attack. In the never-ending race to protect our country, we have to stay one stepahead of a nimble adversary. That's what these steps are designed to do. And we willcontinue to work with Congress to ensure that our intelligence, homeland security, and lawenforcement communities have the resources they need to keep the American people safe. I ordered these two immediate reviews so that we could take immediate action to secure ourcountry. But in the weeks and months ahead, we will continue a sustained and intensiveeffort of analysis and assessment, so that we leave no stone unturned in seeking better waysto protect the American people. I have repeatedly made it clear -- in public with the American people, and in private with mynational security team -- that I will hold my staff, our agencies and the people in themaccountable when they fail to perform their responsibilities at the highest levels. Now, at this stage in the review process it appears that this incident was not the fault of asingle individual or organization, but rather a systemic failure across organizations andagencies. That's why, in addition to the corrective efforts that I've ordered, I've directedagency heads to establish internal accountability reviews, and directed my national securitystaff to monitor their efforts. We will measure progress. And John Brennan will report back tome within 30 days and on a regular basis after that. All of these agencies -- and their leaders-- are responsible for implementing these reforms. And all will be held accountable if theydon't. Moreover, I am less interested in passing out blame than I am in learning from and correctingthese mistakes to make us safer. For ultimately, the buck stops with me. As President, Ihave a solemn responsibility to protect our nation and our people. And when the system fails,it is my responsibility. Over the past two weeks, we've been reminded again of the challenge we face in protectingour country against a foe that is bent on our destruction. And while passions and politics canoften obscure the hard work before us, let's be clear about what this moment demands. Weare at war. We are at war against al Qaeda, a far-reaching network of violence and hatredthat attacked us on 9/11, that killed nearly 3,000 innocent people, and that is plotting tostrike us again. And we will do whatever it takes to defeat them. And we've made progress. Al Qaeda's leadership is hunkered down. We have worked closelywith partners, including Yemen, to inflict major blows against al Qaeda leaders. And we havedisrupted plots at home and abroad, and saved American lives. And we know that the vast majority of Muslims reject al Qaeda. But it is clear that al Qaedaincreasingly seeks to recruit individuals without known terrorist affiliations not just in theMiddle East, but in Africa and other places, to do their bidding. That's why I've directed mynational security team to develop a strategy that addresses the unique challenges posed bylone recruits. And that's why we must communicate clearly to Muslims around the world thatal Qaeda offers nothing except a bankrupt vision of misery and death    - including the murderof fellow Muslims    - while the United States stands with those who seek justice and progress. To advance that progress, we've sought new beginnings with Muslim communities around theworld, one in which we engage on the basis of mutual interest and mutual respect, and worktogether to fulfill the aspirations that all people share -- to get an education, to work withdignity, to live in peace and security. That's what America believes in. That's the vision thatis far more powerful than the hatred of these violent extremists. Here at home, we will strengthen our defenses, but we will not succumb to a siege mentalitythat sacrifices the open society and liberties and values that we cherish as Americans,because great and proud nations don't hunker down and hide behind walls of suspicion andmistrust. That is exactly what our adversaries want, and so long as I am President, we willnever hand them that victory. We will define the character of our country, not some band ofsmall men intent on killing innocent men, women and children. And in this cause, every one of us -- every American, every elected official -- can do our part. Instead of giving into cynicism and division, let's move forward with the confidence andoptimism and unity that defines us as a people. For now is not a time for partisanship, it's atime for citizenship -- a time to come together and work together with the seriousness ofpurpose that our national security demands. That's what it means to be strong in the face of violent extremism. That's how we will prevailin this fight. And that's how we will protect our country and pass it -- safer and stronger -- tothe next generation. Thanks very much.",obama
"Thank you, everybody, for being here. As we all know, our country has endured the deepest recession we've faced ingenerations. And much of the turmoil was caused by irresponsibility on the part of banks andfinancial institutions. Firms took reckless risks in pursuit of short-term profits and soaringbonuses, triggering a financial crisis that nearly pulled the economy into a second GreatDepression. It was little more than a year ago that we stood on that precipice. Several of the world'slargest financial institutions had already failed. Credit markets froze and banks refused tolend. Trillions of dollars in household savings evaporated as stocks, pensions, and homevalues plummeted. And we were losing hundreds of thousands of jobs each month. It was atthis time that many large financial firms -- those left standing -- teetered on the brink ofcollapse, overwhelmed by the consequences of their irresponsible decisions. Now, even though these firms were largely facing a crisis of their own making, their failurecould have led to an even greater calamity for the country. So the Federal Reserve and otheragencies took emergency measures to prevent that outcome. And the previous Administrationstarted a program -- the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP -- to provide these financialinstitutions with funds to survive the turmoil that they had helped unleash. It was a distastefulbut necessary thing to do. Now, we've worked over the last year to manage this program effectively, to hold firmsaccountable, and to recoup as much tax money as possible. Many originally feared that mostof the 700 billion dollars in TARP money would be lost. But because of the management of thisprogram by Secretary Geithner and my economic team, we've now recovered the majority ofthe funds provided to banks. As far as I'm concerned, however, that's not good enough. My commitment is to thetaxpayer. My commitment is to recover every single dime the American people are owed. Andmy determination to achieve this goal is only heightened when I see reports of massive profitsand obscene bonuses at some of the very firms who owe their continued existence to theAmerican people -- folks who have not been made whole, and who continue to face realhardship in this recession. We want our money back. And we're going to get it. And that's why I'm proposing a ""Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee"" to be imposed on majorfinancial firms until the American people are fully compensated for the extraordinaryassistance they provided to Wall Street. If these companies are in good enough shape toafford massive bonuses, they are surely in good enough shape to afford paying back everypenny to taxpayers. Now, our estimate is that the TARP program will end up costing taxpayers around 117 billiondollars -- obviously a lot less than the 700 billion that people had feared, but still a lot ofmoney. The fee will be in place for 10 years, or as long as it takes to raise the full amountnecessary to cover all taxpayer losses. This will not be a cost borne by community banks orsmall financial firms. Only the largest firms with more than 50 billion dollars in assets will beaffected. And the size of the fee each bank owes will be based on its size and exposure todebt, so that we are recovering tax dollars while promoting reform of the banking practicesthat contributed to this crisis. Now, the fact is these financial institutions are essential to our economy. They provide capitaland credit to families purchasing homes, students attending college, businesses seeking tostart up or expand. And that's why the rescue program was as necessary as it wasunfortunate. And that is why, through this fee and broader reforms that we seek, our goal isnot to punish Wall Street firms, but rather to prevent the abuse and excess that nearly causedthe collapse of many of these firms and the financial system itself. We cannot go back to ""business as usual."" And when we see reports of firms once againengaging in risky bets to reap quick rewards, when we see a return to compensation practicesthat seem not to reflect what the country has been through, all that looks like business asusual to me. The financial industry has even launched a massive lobbying campaign, lockingarms with the opposition Party, to stand in the way of reforms to prevent another crisis. That,too, unfortunately, is business as usual. And we're already hearing a hue and cry from WallStreet suggesting that this proposed fee is not only unwelcome but unfair -- that by sometwisted logic it is more appropriate for the American people to bear the costs of the bailout,rather than the industry that benefited from it, even though these executives are out theregiving themselves huge bonuses. What I'd say to these executives is this: Instead of sending a phalanx of lobbyists to fight thisproposal, or employing an army of lawyers and accountants to help evade the fee, I suggestyou might want to consider simply meeting your responsibilities. And I'd urge you to cover thecosts of the rescue not by sticking it to your shareholders or your customers or fellow citizenswith the bill, but by rolling back bonuses for top earners and executives. And more broadly, Iam continuing to call on these firms to put greater effort into helping families stay in theirhomes, to provide small businesses with needed loans, and to embrace -- rather than fight --serious financial reform. Ultimately, it is by taking responsibility -- on Wall Street, here in Washington, all the way toMain Street -- that we're going to move past this period of turmoil. That's how we're going toavoid the cycles of boom and bust that have caused so much havoc. That's how we're going topromote vibrant markets that reward innovation and entrepreneurship and hard work. That'show we're going to create sustained growth without the looming threat of another costlycrisis. That's not only in the best interests of the economy as a whole; it's actually in theinterest of these large banks. So, I'm going to be working closely with Congress on this proposal. And on behalf of the American people, I look forward to signing it into law. Thank you very much.",obama
"Good morning. Praise be to God. Let me begin by thanking the entire Vermont AvenueBaptist Church family for welcoming our family here today. It feels like a family. Thank youfor making us feel that way. To Pastor Wheeler, first lady Wheeler, thank you so much forwelcoming us here today. Congratulations on Jordan Denice -- aka Cornelia. Michelle and I have been blessed with a new nephew this year as well -- Austin LucasRobinson. So maybe at the appropriate time we can make introductions. Now, if Jordan'sfather is like me, then that will be in about 30 years. That is a great blessing. Michelle and Malia and Sasha and I are thrilled to be here today. And I know that sometimesyou have to go through a little fuss to have me as a guest speaker. So let me apologize inadvance for all the fuss. We gather here, on a Sabbath, during a time of profound difficulty for our nation and for ourworld. In such a time, it soothes the soul to seek out the Divine in a spirit of prayer; to seeksolace among a community of believers. But we are not here just to ask the Lord for Hisblessing. We aren't here just to interpret His Scripture. We're also here to call on thememory of one of His noble servants, the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Now, it's fitting that we do so here, within the four walls of Vermont Avenue Baptist Church --here, in a church that rose like the phoenix from the ashes of the civil war; here in a churchformed by freed slaves, whose founding pastor had worn the union blue; here in a churchfrom whose pews congregants set out for marches and from whom choir anthems of freedomwere heard; from whose sanctuary King himself would sermonize from time to time. One of those times was Thursday, December 6, 1956. Pastor, you said you were a little olderthan me, so were you around at that point? You were three years old -- okay. I wasn   t bornyet. On Thursday, December 6, 1956. And before Dr. King had pointed us to the mountaintop,before he told us about his dream in front of the Lincoln Memorial, King came here, as a 27- year-old preacher, to speak on what he called ""The Challenge of a New Age."" ""The Challengeof a New Age."" It was a period of triumph, but also uncertainty, for Dr. King and his followers-- because just weeks earlier, the Supreme Court had ordered the desegregation ofMontgomery's buses, a hard-wrought, hard-fought victory that would put an end to the 381- day historic boycott down in Montgomery, Alabama. And yet, as Dr. King rose to take that pulpit, the future still seemed daunting. It wasn't clearwhat would come next for the movement that Dr. King led. It wasn't clear how we were goingto reach the Promised Land. Because segregation was still rife; lynchings still a fact. Yes, theSupreme Court had ruled not only on the Montgomery buses, but also on Brown v. Board ofEducation. And yet that ruling was defied throughout the South -- by schools and by states;they ignored it with impunity. And here in the nation's capital, the federal government hadyet to fully align itself with the laws on its books and the ideals of its founding. So it's not hard for us, then, to imagine that moment. We can imagine folks coming to thischurch, happy about the boycott being over. We can also imagine them, though, coming hereconcerned about their future, sometimes second-guessing strategy, maybe fighting off somecreeping doubts, perhaps despairing about whether the movement in which they had placedso many of their hopes -- a movement in which they believed so deeply -- could actuallydeliver on its promise. So here we are, more than half a century later, once again facing the challenges of a newage. Here we are, once more marching toward an unknown future, what I call the Joshuageneration to their Moses generation -- the great inheritors of progress paid for with sweatand blood, and sometimes life itself. We've inherited the progress of unjust laws that are now overturned. We take for granted theprogress of a ballot being available to anybody who wants to take the time to actually vote.We enjoy the fruits of prejudice and bigotry being lifted -- slowly, sometimes in fits and starts,but irrevocably -- from human hearts. It's that progress that made it possible for me to behere today; for the good people of this country to elect an African American the 44thPresident of the United States of America. Reverend Wheeler mentioned the inauguration, last year's election. You know, on the heels ofthat victory over a year ago, there were some who suggested that somehow we had enteredinto a post-racial America, all those problems would be solved. There were those who arguedthat because I had spoke of a need for unity in this country that our nation was somehowentering into a period of post-partisanship. That didn   t work out so well. There was a hopeshared by many that life would be better from the moment that I swore that oath. Of course, as we meet here today, one year later, we know the promise of that moment hasnot yet been fully fulfilled. Because of an era of greed and irresponsibility that sowed theseeds of its own demise, because of persistent economic troubles unaddressed through thegenerations, because of a banking crisis that brought the financial system to the brink ofcatastrophe, we are being tested -- in our own lives and as a nation -- as few have beentested before. Unemployment is at its highest level in more than a quarter of a century. Nowhere is it higherthan the African American community. Poverty is on the rise. Home ownership is slipping.Beyond our shores, our sons and daughters are fighting two wars. Closer to home, our Haitianbrothers and sisters are in desperate need. Bruised, battered, many people are legitimatelyfeeling doubt, even despair, about the future. Like those who came to this church on thatThursday in 1956, folks are wondering, where do we go from here? I understand those feelings. I understand the frustration and sometimes anger that so manyfolks feel as they struggle to stay afloat. I get letters from folks around the country everyday; I read 10 a night out of the 40,000 that we receive. And there are stories of hardshipand desperation, in some cases, pleading for help: I need a job. I'm about to lose my home. I don't have health care -- it's about to cause my family to be bankrupt. Sometimes you getletters from children: My mama or my daddy have lost their jobs, is there something you cando to help? Ten letters like that a day we read. So, yes, we're passing through a hard winter. It's the hardest in some time. But let's alwaysremember that, as a people, the American people, we've weathered some hard wintersbefore. This country was founded during some harsh winters. The fishermen, the laborers,the craftsmen who made camp at Valley Forge -- they weathered a hard winter. The slavesand the freedmen who rode an underground railroad, seeking the light of justice under thecover of night -- they weathered a hard winter. The seamstress whose feet were tired, thepastor whose voice echoes through the ages -- they weathered some hard winters. It was forthem, as it is for us, difficult, in the dead of winter, to sometimes see spring coming. They,too, sometimes felt their hopes deflate. And yet, each season, the frost melts, the coldrecedes, the sun reappears. So it was for earlier generations and so it will be for us. What we need to do is to just ask what lessons we can learn from those earlier generationsabout how they sustained themselves during those hard winters, how they persevered andprevailed. Let us in this Joshua generation learn how that Moses generation overcame. Let me offer a few thoughts on this. First and foremost, they did so by remaining firm in theirresolve. Despite being threatened by sniper fire or planted bombs, by shoving and punchingand spitting and angry stares, they adhered to that sweet spirit of resistance, the principles ofnonviolence that had accounted for their success. Second, they understood that as much as our government and our political parties hadbetrayed them in the past -- as much as our nation itself had betrayed its own ideals --government, if aligned with the interests of its people, can be -- and must be -- a force forgood. So they stayed on the Justice Department. They went into the courts. They pressuredCongress, they pressured their President. They didn   t give up on this country. They didn   tgive up on government. They didn   t somehow say government was the problem; they said,we're going to change government, we're going to make it better. Imperfect as it was, theycontinued to believe in the promise of democracy; in America's constant ability to remakeitself, to perfect this union. Third, our predecessors were never so consumed with theoretical debates that they couldn'tsee progress when it came. Sometimes I get a little frustrated when folks just don't want tosee that even if we don't get everything, we're getting something. King understood that thedesegregation of the Armed Forces didn   t end the civil rights movement, because black andwhite soldiers still couldn't sit together at the same lunch counter when they came home. Buthe still insisted on the rightness of desegregating the Armed Forces. That was a good firststep -- even as he called for more. He didn   t suggest that somehow by the signing of the CivilRights that somehow all discrimination would end. But he also didn   t think that we shouldn   tsign the Civil Rights Act because it hasn   t solved every problem. Let's take a victory, he said,and then keep on marching. Forward steps, large and small, were recognized for what theywere -- which was progress. Fourth, at the core of King's success was an appeal to conscience that touched hearts andopened minds, a commitment to universal ideals -- of freedom, of justice, of equality -- thatspoke to all people, not just some people. For King understood that without broad support,any movement for civil rights could not be sustained. That's why he marched with the whiteauto worker in Detroit. That's why he linked arm with the Mexican farm worker in California,and united people of all colors in the noble quest for freedom. Of course, King overcame in other ways as well. He remained strategically focused on gainingground -- his eyes on the prize constantly -- understanding that change would not be easy,understand that change wouldn't come overnight, understanding that there would be setbacksand false starts along the way, but understanding, as he said in 1956, that ""we can walk andnever get weary, because we know there is a great camp meeting in the promised land offreedom and justice."" And it's because the Moses generation overcame that the trials we face today are verydifferent from the ones that tested us in previous generations. Even after the worst recessionin generations, life in America is not even close to being as brutal as it was back then for somany. That's the legacy of Dr. King and his movement. That's our inheritance. Having saidthat, let there be no doubt the challenges of our new age are serious in their own right, andwe must face them as squarely as they faced the challenges they saw. I know it's been a hard road we've traveled this year to rescue the economy, but the economyis growing again. The job losses have finally slowed, and around the country, there's signsthat businesses and families are beginning to rebound. We are making progress. I know it's been a hard road that we've traveled to reach this point on health reform. Ipromise you I know. But under the legislation I will sign into law, insurance companies won'tbe able to drop you when you get sick, and more than 30 million people -- our fellowAmericans will finally have insurance. More than 30 million men and women and children,mothers and fathers, won't be worried about what might happen to them if they get sick. Thiswill be a victory not for Democrats; this will be a victory for dignity and decency, for ourcommon humanity. This will be a victory for the United States of America. Let's work to change the political system, as imperfect as it is. I know people can feel downabout the way things are going sometimes here in Washington. I know it's tempting to giveup on the political process. But we've put in place tougher rules on lobbying and ethics andtransparency -- tougher rules than any administration in history. It's not enough, but it'sprogress. Progress is possible. Don't give up on voting. Don't give up on advocacy. Don'tgive up on activism. There are too many needs to be met, too much work to be done. LikeDr. King said, ""We must accept finite disappointment but never lose infinite hope."" Let us broaden our coalition, building a confederation not of liberals or conservatives, not ofred states or blue states, but of all Americans who are hurting today, and searching for abetter tomorrow. The urgency of the hour demands that we make common cause with all ofAmerica's workers -- white, black, brown -- all of whom are being hammered by thisrecession, all of whom are yearning for that spring to come. It demands that we reach out tothose who've been left out in the cold even when the economy is good, even when we're notin recession -- the youth in the inner cities, the youth here in Washington, D.C., people inrural communities who haven't seen prosperity reach them for a very long time. It demandsthat we fight discrimination, whatever form it may come. That means we fight discrimination against gays and lesbians, and we make common cause to reform our immigration system. And finally, we have to recognize, as Dr. King did, that progress can't just come from without-- it also has to come from within. And over the past year, for example, we've mademeaningful improvements in the field of education. I've got a terrific Secretary of Education,Arne Duncan. He's been working hard with states and working hard with the D.C. schooldistrict, and we've insisted on reform, and we've insisted on accountability. We we're putting in more money and we've provided more Pell Grants and more tuition taxcredits and simpler financial aid forms. We've done all that, but parents still need to parent. Kids still need to own up to their responsibilities. We still have to set high expectations forour young people. Folks can't simply look to government for all the answers without alsolooking inside themselves, inside their own homes, for some of the answers. Progress will only come if we're willing to promote that ethic of hard work, a sense ofresponsibility, in our own lives. I'm not talking, by the way, just to the African Americancommunity. Sometimes when I say these things people assme, well, he's just talking to blackpeople about working hard. No, no, no, no. I'm talking to the American community. Becausesomewhere along the way, we, as a nation, began to lose touch with some of our core values. You know what I'm talking about. We became enraptured with the false prophets whoprophesized an easy path to success, paved with credit cards and home equity loans and get- rich-quick schemes, and the most important thing was to be a celebrity; it doesn   t matterwhat you do, as long as you get on TV. That's everybody. We forgot what made the bus boycott a success; what made the civil rights movement asuccess; what made the United States of America a success -- that, in this country, there's nosubstitute for hard work, no substitute for a job well done, no substitute for being responsiblestewards of God's blessings. What we're called to do, then, is rebuild America from its foundation on up. To reinvest in theessentials that we've neglected for too long -- like health care, like education, like a betterenergy policy, like basic infrastructure, like scientific research. Our generation is called tobuckle down and get back to basics. We must do so not only for ourselves, but also for our children, and their children. For Jordanand for Austin. That's a sacrifice that falls on us to make. It's a much smaller sacrifice thanthe Moses generation had to make, but it's still a sacrifice. Yes, it's hard to transition to a clean energy economy. Sometimes it may be inconvenient, butit's a sacrifice that we have to make. It's hard to be fiscally responsible when we have allthese human needs, and we're inheriting enormous deficits and debt, but that's a sacrificethat we're going to have to make. You know, it's easy, after a hard day's work, to just putyour kid in front of the TV set -- you're tired, don't want to fuss with them -- instead ofreading to them, but that's a sacrifice we must joyfully accept. Sometimes it's hard to be a good father and good mother. Sometimes it's hard to be a goodneighbor, or a good citizen, to give up time in service of others, to give something ofourselves to a cause that's greater than ourselves -- as Michelle and I are urging folks to dotomorrow to honor and celebrate Dr. King. But these are sacrifices that we are called tomake. These are sacrifices that our faith calls us to make. Our faith in the future. Our faithin America. Our faith in God. And on his sermon all those years ago, Dr. King quoted a poet's verse: Truth forever on the scaffoldWrong forever on the throne   And behind the dim unknown stands GodWithin the shadows keeping watch above his own. Even as Dr. King stood in this church, a victory in the past and uncertainty in the future, hetrusted God. He trusted that God would make a way. A way for prayers to be answered. Away for our union to be perfected. A way for the arc of the moral universe, no matter howlong, to slowly bend towards truth and bend towards freedom, to bend towards justice. Hehad faith that God would make a way out of no way. You know, folks ask me sometimes why I look so calm. They say, all this stuff coming at you,how come you just seem calm? And I have a confession to make here. There are timeswhere I'm not so calm. Reggie Love knows. My wife knows. There are times when progressseems too slow. There are times when the words that are spoken about me hurt. There aretimes when the barbs sting. There are times when it feels like all these efforts are for naught,and change is so painfully slow in coming, and I have to confront my own doubts. But let me tell you -- during those times it's faith that keeps me calm. It's faith that gives mepeace. The same faith that leads a single mother to work two jobs to put a roof over her headwhen she has doubts. The same faith that keeps an unemployed father to keep on submittingjob applications even after he's been rejected a hundred times. The same faith that says to ateacher even if the first nine children she's teaching she can't reach, that that 10th one she'sgoing to be able to reach. The same faith that breaks the silence of an earthquake's wakewith the sound of prayers and hymns sung by a Haitian community. A faith in things notseen, in better days ahead, in Him who holds the future in the hollow of His hand. A faith thatlets us mount up on wings like eagles; lets us run and not be weary; lets us walk and notfaint. So let us hold fast to that faith, as Joshua held fast to the faith of his fathers, and together,we shall overcome the challenges of a new age. Together, we shall seize the promise of thismoment. Together, we shall make a way through winter, and we're going to welcome thespring. Through God all things are possible. May the memory of Dr. Martin Luther King continue to inspire us and ennoble our world andall who inhabit it. And may God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you.",obama
"Hello  Springfield!  Look  at  all  of  you.  Look  at  all  of  you.  Goodness.  Thank  you  so  much.  Thank   you  so  much.  Giving  all  praise  and  honor  to  God  for  bringing  us  here  today.  Thank  you  so   much.  I  am  so  grateful  to  see  all  of  you.  You  guys  are  still  cheering  back  there?   Let  me  begin  by  saying  thanks  to  all  you  who've  traveled,  from  far  and  wide,  to  brave  the  cold   today.  I  know  it's  a  little  chilly        but  I'm  fired  up.   You  know,  we  all  made  this  journey  for  a  reason.  It's  humbling  to  see  a  crowd  like  this,  but  in   my  heart  I  know  you  didn't  just  come  here  for  me.  You  came  here  because  you  believe  in   what  this  country  can  be.  In  the  face  of  war,  you  believe  there  can  be  peace.  In  the  face  of   despair,  you  believe  there  can  be  hope.  In  the  face  of  a  politics  that  shut  you  out,  that's  told   you  to  settle,  that's  divided  us  for  too  long,  you  believe  that  we  can  be  one  people,  reaching   for  what's  possible,  building  that  more  perfect  union.   That's  the  journey  we're  on  today.  But  let  me  tell  you  how  I  came  to  be  here.  As  most  of  you   know,  I'm  not  a  native  of  this  great  state.  I  moved  to  Illinois  over  two  decades  ago.  I  was  a   young  man  then,  just  a  year  out  of  college.  I  knew  no  one  in  Chicago  when  I  arrived,  was   without  money  or  family  connections.  But  a  group  of  churches  had  offered  me  a  job  as  a   community  organizer  for  the  grand  sum  of  13,000  dollars  a  year.  And  I  accepted  the  job,  sight   unseen,  motivated  then  by  a  single,  simple,  powerful  idea:  that  I  might  play  a  small  part  in   building  a  better  America.   My  work  took  me  to  some  of  Chicago's  poorest  neighborhoods.  I  joined  with  pastors  and  lay     people  to  deal  with  communities  that  had  been  ravaged  by  plant  closings.

Copyright  Status:  Restricted,  seek  permission.    2008   Page  1      I  saw  that  the  problems  people  faced  weren't  simply  local  in  nature,  that  the  decisions  to  close   a  steel  mill  was  made  by  distant  executives,  that  the  lack  of  textbooks  and  computers  in  a   school  could  be  traced  to  skewed  priorities  of  politicians  a  thousand  miles  away,  and  that   when  a  child  turns  to  violence        I  came  to  realize  that        there's  a  hole  in  that  boy's  heart   that  no  government  alone  can  fill.   It  was  in  these  neighborhoods  that  I  received  the  best  education  that  I  ever  had,  and  where  I   learned  the  meaning  of  my  Christian  faith.   After  three  years  of  this  work,  I  went  to  law  school,  because  I  wanted  to  understand  how  the   law  should  work  for  those  in  need.  I  became  a  civil  rights  lawyer,  and  taught  constitutional   law,  and  after  a  time,  I  came  to  understand  that  our  cherished  rights  of  liberty  and  equality   depend  on  the  active  participation  of  an  awakened  electorate.  It  was  with  these  ideas  in  mind   that  I  arrived  in  this  capital  city  as  a  state  Senator.   It  was  here,  in  Springfield,  where  I  saw  all  that  is  America  converge        farmers  and  teachers,   businessmen  and  laborers,  all  of  them  with  a  story  to  tell,  all  of  them  seeking  a  seat  at  the   table,  all  of  them  clamoring  to  be  heard.  I  made  lasting  friendships  here,  friends  that  I  see   here  in  the  audience  today.  It  was  here  where  we  learned  to  disagree  without  being   disagreeable    that  it's  possible  to  compromise  so  long  as  you  know  those  principles  that  can   never  be  compromised    and  that  so  long  as  we're  willing  to  listen  to  each  other,  we  can   assume  the  best  in  people  instead  of  the  worst.   That's  why  we  were  able  to  reform  a  death  penalty  system  that  was  broken    that's  why  we   were  able  to  give  health  insurance  to  children  in  need    that's  why  we  made  the  tax  system   right  here  in  Springfield  more  fair  and  just  for  working  families    and  that's  why  we  passed   ethics  reform  that  the  cynics  said  could  never,  ever  be  passed.   It  was  here,  in  Springfield,  where  North,  South,  East,  and  West  come  together  that  I  was   reminded  of  the  essential  decency  of  the  American  people        where  I  came  to  believe  that   through  this  decency,  we  can  build  a  more  hopeful  America.  And  that  is  why,  in  the  shadow  of   the  Old  State  Capitol,  where  Lincoln  once  called  on  a  house  divided  to  stand  together,  where   common  hopes  and  common  dreams  still  live,  I  stand  before  you  today  to  announce  my   candidacy  for  President  of  the  United  States  of  America.   Look,  I  recognize  that  there  is  a  certain  presumptuousness  in  this,  a  certain  audacity,  to  this   announcement.  I  know  that  I  haven't  spent  a  lot  of  time  learning  the  ways  of  Washington.  But   I've  been  there  long  enough  to  know  that  the  ways  of  Washington  must  change.   The  genius  of  our  Founders  is  that  they  designed  a  system  of  government  that  can  be   changed.  And  we  should  take  heart,  because  we've  changed  this  country  before.  In  the  face  of   tyranny,  a  band  of  patriots  brought  an  empire  to  its  knees.  In  the  face  of  secession,  we   unified  a  nation  and  set  the  captives  free.  In  the  face  of  Depression,  we  put  people  back  to   work  and  lifted  millions  out  of  poverty.  We  welcomed  immigrants  to  our  shores.  We  opened   railroads  to  the  west.  We  landed  a  man  on  the  moon.  And  we  heard  a  King's  call  to  let  ""justice   roll  down  like  waters,  and  righteousness  like  a  mighty  stream."" Transcription  by  Michael  E.

Each  and  every  time,  a  new  generation  has  risen  up  and  done  what's   needed  to  be  done.  Today  we  are  called  once  more,  and  it  is  time  for  our  generation  to   answer  that  call.  For  that  is  our  unyielding  faith        that  in  the  face  of  impossible  odds,  people   who  love  their  country  can  change  it.   That's  what  Abraham  Lincoln  understood.  He  had  his  doubts.  He  had  his  defeats.  He  had  his   skeptics.  He  had  his  setbacks.  But  through  his  will  and  his  words,  he  moved  a  nation  and   helped  free  a  people.  It's  because  of  the  millions  who  rallied  to  his  cause  that  we're  no  longer   divided,  North  and  South,  slave  and  free.  It's  because  men  and  women  of  every  race,  from   every  walk  of  life,  continued  to  march  for  freedom  long  after  Lincoln  was  laid  to  rest,  that   today  we  have  the  chance  to  face  the  challenges  of  this  millennium  together,  as  one  people         as  Americans.   All  of  us  know  what  those  challenges  are  today:  a  war  with  no  end,  a  dependence  on  oil  that   threatens  our  future,  schools  where  too  many  children  aren't  learning,  and  families  struggling   paycheck  to  paycheck  despite  working  as  hard  as  they  can.  We  know  the  challenges.  We've   heard  them.  We've  talked  about  them  for  years.   What's  stopped  us  from  meeting  these  challenges  is  not  the  absence  of  sound  policies  and   sensible  plans.  What's  stopped  us  is  the  failure  of  leadership,  the  smallness  of  our  politics         the  ease  with  which  we're  distracted  by  the  petty  and  trivial,  our  chronic  avoidance  of  tough   decisions,  our  preference  for  scoring  cheap  political  points  instead  of  rolling  up  our  sleeves   and  building  a  working  consensus  to  tackle  the  big  problems  of  America.   For  the  past  six  years  we've  been  told  that  our  mounting  debts  don't  matter.  We've  been  told   that  the  anxiety  Americans  feel  about  rising  health  care  costs  and  stagnant  wages  are  an   illusion.  We've  been  told  that  climate  change  is  a  hoax.  We've  been  told  that  tough  talk  and   an  ill  conceived  war  can  replace  diplomacy,  and  strategy,  and  foresight.  And  when  all  else   fails,  when  Katrina  happens,  or  the  death  toll  in  Iraq  mounts,  we've  been  told  that  our  crises   are  somebody  else's  fault.  We're  distracted  from  our  real  failures,  and  told  to  blame  the  other   Party,  or  gay  people,  or  immigrants.   And  as  people  have  looked  away  in  disillusionment  and  frustration,  we  know  what's  filled  the   void:  the  cynics,  the  lobbyists,  the  special  interests        who've  turned  our  government  into  a   game  only  they  can  afford  to  play.  They  write  the  checks  and  you  get  stuck  with  the  bill.  They   get  the  access  while  you  get  to  write  a  letter.  They  think  they  own  this  government,  but  we're   here  today  to  take  it  back.  The  time  for  that  kind  of  politics  is  over.  It  is  through.  It's  time  to   turn  the  page        right  here,  and  right  now.   Look,  we  have  made  some  progress  already.  I  was  proud  to  help  lead  the  fight  in  Congress   that  led  to  the  most  sweeping  ethics  reforms  since  Watergate.  But  Washington  has  a  long  way   to  go,  and  it  won't  be  easy.  That's  why  we'll  have  to  set  priorities.  We'll  have  to  make  hard   choices.  And  although  government  will  play  a  crucial  role  in  bringing  about  the  changes  that   we  need,  more  money  and  programs  alone  will  not  get  us  to  where  we  need  to  go.  Each  of  us,   in  our  own  lives,  will  have  to  accept  responsibility        for  instilling  an  ethic  of  achievement  in   our  children,  for  adapting  to  a  more  competitive  economy,  for  strengthening  our  communities,   and  sharing  some  measure  of  sacrifice.

Let  us  transform  this  nation.  Let  us  be   the  generation  that  reshapes  our  economy  to  compete  in  the  digital  age.  Let's  set  high   standards  for  our  schools  and  give  them  the  resources  they  need  to  succeed.  Let's  recruit  a   new  army  of  teachers,  and  give  them  better  pay  and  more  support  in  exchange  for  more   accountability.  Let's  make  college  more  affordable,  and  let's  invest  in  scientific  research,  and   let's  lay  down  broadband  lines  through  the  heart  of  inner  cities  and  rural  towns  all  across   America.  We  can  do  that.   And  as  our  economy  changes,  let's  be  the  generation  that  ensures  our  nation's  workers  are   sharing  in  our  prosperity.  Let's  protect  the  hard  earned  benefits  their  companies  have   promised.  Let's  make  it  possible  for  hardworking  Americans  to  save  for  retirement.  Let's  allow   our  unions  and  their  organizers  to  lift  up  this  country's  middle  class  again.  We  can  do  that.   Let's  be  the  generation  that  ends  poverty  in  America.  Every  single  person  willing  to  work   should  be  able  to  get  job  training  that  leads  to  a  job,  and  earn  a  living  wage  that  can  pay  the   bills,  and  afford  child  care  so  their  kids  can  have  a  safe  place  to  go  when  they  work.  We  can   do  this.   And  let's  be  the  generation  that  finally,  after  all  these  years,  tackles  our  health  care  crisis.  We   can  control  costs  by  focusing  on  prevention,  by  providing  better  treatment  to  the  chronically   ill,  and  using  technology  to  cut  the  bureaucracy.  Let's  be  the  generation  that  says  right  here,   right  now:  We  will  have  universal  health  care  in  America  by  the  end  of  the  next  President's   first  term.  We  can  do  that.   Let's  be  the  generation  that  finally  frees  America  from  the  tyranny  of  oil.  We  can  harness   homegrown,  alternative  fuels  like  ethanol  and  spur  the  production  of  more  fuel  efficient  cars.   We  can  set  up  a  system  for  capping  greenhouse  gases.  We  can  turn  this  crisis  of  global   warming  into  a  moment  of  opportunity  for  innovation,  and  job  creation,  and  an  incentive  for   businesses  that  will  serve  as  a  model  for  the  world.  Let's  be  the  generation  that  makes  future   generations  proud  of  what  we  did  here.   Most  of  all,  let's  be  the  generation  that  never  forgets  what  happened  on  that  September  day   and  confront  the  terrorists  with  everything  we've  got.  Politics  doesn't  have  to  divide  us  on  this   anymore    we  can  work  together  to  keep  our  country  safe.  I've  worked  with  the  Republican   Senator  Dick  Lugar  to  pass  a  law  that  will  secure  and  destroy  some  of  the  world's  deadliest   weapons.  We  can  work  together  to  track  down  terrorists  with  a  stronger  military.  We  can   tighten  the  net  around  their  finances.  We  can  improve  our  intelligence  capabilities  and  finally   get  homeland  security  right.  But  let's  also  understand  that  ultimate  victory  against  our   enemies  will  only  come  by  rebuilding  our  alliances  and  exporting  those  ideals  that  bring  hope   and  opportunity  to  millions  of  people  around  the  globe.   We  can  do  those  things.   But  all  of  this  cannot  come  to  pass  until  we  bring  an  end  to  this  war  in  Iraq.  Most  of  you  know   that  I  opposed  this  war  from  the  start.  I  thought  it  was  a  tragic  mistake. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Copyright  Status:  Restricted,  seek  permission.    2008   Page  4      Today  we  grieve  for  the  families  who  have  lost  loved  ones,  the  hearts  that  have  been  broken,   and  the  young  lives  that  could  have  been.  America,  it  is  time  to  start  bringing  our  troops   home.  It's  time  to  admit  that  no  amount  of  American  lives  can  resolve  the  political   disagreement  that  lies  at  the  heart  of  someone  else's  civil  war.  That's  why  I  have  a  plan  that   will  bring  our  combat  troops  home  by  March  of  2008.  Letting  the  Iraqis  know  that  we  will  not   be  there  forever  is  our  last,  best  hope  to  pressure  the  Sunni  and  Shia  to  come  to  the  table   and  find  peace.   And  there's  one  other  thing  that  it's  not  too  late  to  get  right  about  this  war,  and  that  is  the   homecoming  of  the  men  and  women,  our  veterans,  who  have  sacrificed  the  most.  Let  us   honor  their  courage  by  providing  the  care  they  need  and  rebuilding  the  military  they  love.  Let   us  be  the  generation  that  begins  that  work.   I  know  there  are  those  who  don't  believe  we  can  do  all  these  things.  I  understand  the   skepticism.  After  all,  every  four  years,  candidates  from  both  Parties  make  similar  promises,   and  I  expect  this  year  will  be  no  different.  All  of  us  running  for  President  will  travel  around  the   country  offering  ten  point  plans  and  making  grand  speeches    all  of  us  will  trumpet  those   qualities  we  believe  make  us  uniquely  qualified  to  lead  this  country.  But  too  many  times,  after   the  election  is  over,  and  the  confetti  is  swept  away,  all  those  promises  fade  from  memory,  and   the  lobbyists  and  special  interests  move  in,  and  people  turn  away,  disappointed  as  before,  left   to  struggle  on  their  own.   That's  why  this  campaign  can't  only  be  about  me.  It  must  be  about  us.  It  must  be  about  what   we  can  do  together.  This  campaign  must  be  the  occasion,  the  vehicle,  of  your  hopes,  and  your   dreams.  It  will  take  your  time,  your  energy,  and  your  advice  to  push  us  forward  when  we're   doing  right,  and  let  us  know  when  we're  not.  This  campaign  has  to  be  about  reclaiming  the   meaning  of  citizenship,  restoring  our  sense  of  common  purpose,  and  realizing  that  few   obstacles  can  withstand  the  power  of  millions  of  voices  calling  for  change.   By  ourselves,  this  change  will  not  happen.  Divided,  we  are  bound  to  fail.  But  the  life  of  a  tall,   gangly,  self  made  Springfield  lawyer  tells  us  that  a  different  future  is  possible.   He  tells  us  that  there  is  power  in  words.   He  tells  us  that  there's  power  in  conviction.   That  beneath  all  the  differences  of  race  and  region,  faith  and  station,  we  are  one  people.   He  tells  us  that  there's  power  in  hope.   As  Lincoln  organized  the  forces  arrayed  against  slavery,  he  was  heard  to  say  this:  ""Of  strange,   discordant,  and  even  hostile  elements,  we  gathered  from  the  four  winds,  and  formed  and   fought  to  battle  through.""     That  is  our  purpose  here  today.  That  is  why  I  am  in  this  race        not  just  to  hold  an  office,  but   to  gather  with  you  to  transform  a  nation.  I  want  to  win  that  next  battle        for  justice  and   opportunity. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.

I  want  us  to  take  up  the  unfinished  business  of  perfecting  our  union,  and  building  a  better   America.   And  if  you  will  join  with  me  in  this  improbable  quest,  if  you  feel  destiny  calling,  and  see  as  I   see,  the  future  of  endless  possibility  stretching  out  before  us    if  you  sense,  as  I  sense,  that   the  time  is  now  to  shake  off  our  slumber,  and  slough  off  our  fears,  and  make  good  on  the   debt  we  owe  past  and  future  generations,  then  I  am  ready  to  take  up  the  cause,  and  march   with  you,  and  work  with  you        today.   Together  we  can  finish  the  work  that  needs  to  be  done,  and  usher  in  a  new  birth  of  freedom   on  this  Earth.   Thank  you  very  much  everybody        let's  get  to  work!

"Good morning. And thank you to everyone who worked to bring us to this day, especially theInternational Auschwitz Council and the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum. To President Kacynski, Prime Minister Tusk, and to the people of Poland: Thank you forpreserving a place of such great pain for the Polish people, but a place of remembrance andlearning for the world. Although I can   t be with you in person, I am proud that the United States is represented theretoday by a delegation of distinguished Americans, including Ambassador Feinstein; my wifeMichelle   s chief of staff, Susan Sher; and my good friend, and the son of Holocaust survivors,Julius Genachowski. And let me commend you for recognizing a woman who has devoted her life to preserving thelessons of the shoah for future generations -- Sara Bloomfield of the United States HolocaustMemorial Museum in Washington. But most of all, I want to thank those of you who found the strength to come back again, somany years later, despite the horror you saw here, the suffering you endured here, and theloved ones you lost here. Those of us who did not live through those dark days will never trulyunderstand what it means to have hate literally etched into your arms. But we understand themessage that you carry in your hearts. For you know the truth that Elie Wiesel spoke when I stood with him at Buchenwald lastspring. There, where his father and so many innocent souls left this earth, Elie said:""...memory has become [a] sacred duty of all people of goodwill.    We have a sacred duty to remember the twisted thinking that led here -- how a great societyof culture and science succumbed to the worst instincts of man and rationalized mass murderand one of the most barbaric acts in history. We have a sacred duty to remember the cruelty that occurred here, as told in the simpleobjects that speak to us even now: the suitcases that still bear their names; the wooden clogsthey wore; the round bowls from which they ate; those brick buildings from which there wasno escape -- where so many Jews died with Sh   ma Israel on their lips; and the very earth atAuschwitz, which is still hallowed by their ashes -- Jews and those who tried to save them,Polish and Hungarian, French and Dutch, Roma and Russian, straight and gay, and so manyothers. But even as we recall man   s capacity for evil, Auschwitz also tells another story -- of man   scapacity for good: the small acts of compassion -- the sharing of some bread that kept a childalive; the great acts of resistance that blew up the crematorium and tried to stop theslaughter; the Polish Rescuers; and those who earned their place forever in the RighteousAmong the Nations. And you: the survivors. The perpetrators of that crime tried to annihilate the entire Jewish people. But they failed.Because 65 years ago today, when the gates flew open, you were still standing. And everyday that you have lived, every child and grandchild that your families have brought into theworld with love, every day the sun rises on the Jewish state of Israel -- that is the ultimaterebuke to the ignorance and hatred of this place. So to those of you who have come back today, I say, no, you are not    former prisoners.    Youare living memorials: living memorials to the loved ones you left here, and to the spirit wemust strive to uphold in our time -- not simply to bear witness, but to bear a burden -- theburden of seeing our common humanity; of resisting anti-Semitism and ignorance in all itsforms; of refusing to become bystanders to evil, whenever and wherever it rears its ugly face. Let that be the true meaning of Auschwitz. Let that be the liberation we celebrate today -- aliberation of the spirit that, if embraced, can lead us all -- individuals and as nations -- to beamong the righteous. May God bless you all, and may God bless the memory of all those who rest here.",obama
"Good  morning,  everybody.  This  morning,  I  sent  a  budget  to  Congress  for  the  coming  year.  It's   a  budget  that  reflects  the  serious  challenges  facing  the  country.  We're  at  war.  Our  economy   has  lost  7  million  jobs  over  the  last  two  years.  And  our  government  is  deeply  in  debt  after   what  can  only  be  described  as  a  decade  of  profligacy.   The  fact  is,  10  years  ago,  we  had  a  budget  surplus  of  more  than  $200  billion,  with  projected   surpluses  stretching  out  toward  the  horizon.  Yet  over  the  course  of  the  past  10  years,  the   previous  administration  and  previous  Congresses  created  an  expensive  new  drug  program,   passed  massive  tax  cuts  for  the  wealthy,  and  funded  two  wars  without  paying  for  any  of  it         all  of  which  was  compounded  by  recession  and  by  rising  health  care  costs.  As  a  result,  when  I   first  walked  through  the  door,  the  deficit  stood  at  $1.3  trillion,  with  projected  deficits  of  $8   trillion  over  the  next  decade.   If  we  had  taken  office  during  ordinary  times,  we  would  have  started  bringing  down  these   deficits  immediately.  But  one  year  ago,  our  country  was  in  crisis:  We  were  losing  nearly   700,000  jobs  each  month,  the  economy  was  in  a  free  fall,  and  the  financial  system  was  near   collapse.  Many  feared  another  Great  Depression.  So  we  initiated  a  rescue,  and  that  rescue   was  not  without  significant  cost    it  added  to  the  deficit  as  well.   One  year  later,  because  of  the  steps  we've  taken,  we're  in  a  very  different  place.  But  we  can't   simply  move  beyond  this  crisis    we  have  to  address  the  irresponsibility  that  led  to  it.  And  that   includes  the  failure  to  rein  in  spending,  as  well  a  reliance  on  borrowing        from  Wall  Street  to   Washington  to  Main  Street        to  fuel  our  growth. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.  Property  of     Copyright    2010.  All  rights  reserved.   Page  1      That's  what  we  have  to  change.  We  have  to  do  what  families  across  America  are  doing:  Save   where  we  can  so  that  we  can  afford  what  we  need.   Now,  I  think  it's  very  important  to  understand:  We  won't  be  able  to  bring  down  this  deficit   overnight,  given  that  the  recovery  is  still  taking  hold  and  families  across  the  country  still  need   help.  We  will  continue,  for  example,  to  do  what  it  takes  to  create  jobs.  That's  reflected  in  my   budget    it's  essential.  The  budget  includes  new  tax  cuts  for  people  who  invest  in  small   businesses,  tax  credits  for  small  businesses  that  hire  new  workers,  investments  that  will   create  jobs  repairing  roads  and  bridges,  and  tax  breaks  for  retrofitting  homes  to  save  energy.   We  also  continue  to  lay  a  new  foundation  for  lasting  growth,  which  is  essential  as  well.  Just  as   it  would  be  a  terrible  mistake  to  borrow  against  our  children's  future  to  pay  our  way  today,  it   would  be  equally  wrong  to  neglect  their  future  by  failing  to  invest  in  areas  that  will  determine   our  economic  success  in  this  new  century.   That's  why  we  build  on  the  largest  investment  in  clean  energy  in  history,  as  well  as  increase   investment  in  scientific  research,  so  that  we  are  fostering  the  industries  and  jobs  of  the  future   right  here  in  America.   That's  why  I've  proposed  a  more  than  6  percent  increase  in  funding  for  the  Education   Department.   And  this  funding  is  tied  to  reforms  that  raise  student  achievement,  inspire   students  to  excel  in  math  and  science,  and  turn  around  failing  schools  which  consign  too  many   young  people  to  a  lesser  future        because  in  the  21st  century  there  is  no  better  anti  poverty   program  than  a  world  class  education.   And  that's  why  we  eliminate  a  wasteful  subsidy  to  banks  that  lend  to  college  students,  and   use  that  money  to  revitalize  community  colleges  and  make  college  more  affordable.  This  will   help  us  reach  the  goal  I've  set  for  America:  By  2020  we  will  once  again  have  the  highest   proportion  of  college  graduates  in  the  world.   These  are  the  investments  we  must  make  to  create  jobs  and  opportunity  now  and  in  the   future.   And  in  a  departure  from  the  way  business  had  been  done  in  Washington,  we  actually   show  how  we  pay  for  these  investments  while  putting  our  country  on  a  more  fiscally   sustainable  path.   I've  proposed  a  freeze  in  government  spending  for  three  years.  This  won't  apply  to  the   benefits  folks  get  through  Social  Security,  Medicaid,  or  Medicare.  And  it  won't  apply  to  our   national  security        including  benefits  for  veterans.  But  it  will  apply  to  all  other  discretionary   government  programs.  And  we're  not  simply  photocopying  last  year's  budget    freezing   spending  does  not  mean  we  won't  cut  what  doesn't  work  to  pay  for  what  does. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.  Property  of     Copyright    2010.  All  rights  reserved.   Page  2      We  have  gone  through  every  department's  spending  line  by  line,  item  by  item,  looking  for   inefficiency,  duplication,  and  programs  that  have  outlived  their  usefulness.  That's  how  we   freeze  discretionary  spending.  Last  year,  we  found  $17  billion  in  cuts.  This  year,  we've  already   found  $20  billion.   Now,  some  of  these  cuts  are  just  common  sense.  For  example,  we  cut  $115  million  from  a   program  that  pays  states  to  clean  up  mines  that  have  already  been  cleaned  up.  We're  also   cutting  a  Forest  Service  economic  development  program  that  strayed  so  far  from  any  mission   that  it  funded  a  music  festival.  And  we're  saving  $20  million  by  stopping  the  refurbishment  of   a  Department  of  Energy  science  center  that  the  Department  of  Energy  does  not  want  to   refurbish.   Other  cuts,  though,  are  more  painful,  because  the  goals  of  the  underlying  programs  are   worthy.   We  eliminate  one  program  that  provides  grants  to  do  environmental  clean  up  of   abandoned  buildings.  That's  a  mission  I  support,  but  there  are  other  sources  of  private  and   public  funds  to  achieve  it.  We  also  eliminated  a  $120  million  program  that  allows  folks  to  get   their  Earned  Income  Tax  Credit  in  advance.  I  am  a  big  supporter  of  the  Earned  Income  Tax   Credit.  The  problem  is  80  percent  of  people  who  got  this  advance  didn't  comply  with  one  or   more  of  the  program's  requirements.   So  I'm  willing  to  reduce  waste  in  programs  I  care  about,  and  I'm  asking  members  of  Congress   to  do  the  same.   I'm  asking  Republicans  and  Democrats  alike  to  take  a  fresh  look  at  programs   they've  supported  in  the  past  to  see  what's  working  and  what's  not,  and  trim  back   accordingly.   Like  any  business,  we're  also  looking  for  ways  to  get  more  bang  for  our  buck,  by  promoting   innovation  and  cutting  red  tape.  For  example,  we  consolidate  38  separate  education  programs   into  11.  And  last  fall,  we  launched  the  ""SAVE  Awards""  to  solicit  ideas  from  federal  employees   about  how  make  government  more  efficient  and  more  effective.  I'm  proud  to  say  that  a   number  of  these  ideas        like  allowing  Social  Security  appointments  to  be  made  online         made  it  into  our  budget.   I  also  want  to  note  even  though  the  Department  of  Defense  is  exempt  from  the  budget  freeze,   it's  not  exempt  from  budget  common  sense.  It's  not  exempt  from  looking  for  savings.  We   save  money  by  eliminating  unnecessary  defense  programs  that  do  nothing  to  keep  us   safe.  One  example  is  the  $2.5  billion  that  we're  spending  to  build  C  17  transport  aircraft.  Four   years  ago,  the  Defense  Department  decided  to  cease  production  because  it  had  acquired  the   number  requested        180.  Yet  every  year  since,  Congress  had  provided  unrequested  money   for  more  C  17s  that  the  Pentagon  doesn't  want  or  need.  It's  waste,  pure  and  simple.   And  there  are  other  steps  we're  taking  to  rein  in  deficits.  I've  proposed  a  fee  on  big  banks  to   pay  back  taxpayers  for  the  bailout.  We're  reforming  the  way  contracts  are  awarded,  to  save   taxpayers  billions  of  dollars. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.  Property  of     Copyright    2010.

Page  3      And  while  we  extend  middle  class  tax  cuts  in  this  budget,  we  will  not  continue  costly  tax  cuts   for  oil  companies,  investment  fund  managers,  and  those  making  over  $250,000  a  year.  We   just  can't  afford  it.   Finally,  changing  spending  as  usual  depends  on  changing  politics  as  usual.  And  that's  why   I've  proposed  a  bipartisan  fiscal  commission:  a  panel  of  Democrats  and  Republicans  who   would  hammer  out  concrete  deficit  reduction  proposals  over  the  medium  and  long  term,  but   would  come  up  with  those  answers  by  a  certain  deadline.  I  should  point  out,  by  the  way,  that   is  an  idea  that  had  strong  bipartisan  support,  was  originally  introduced  by  Senators  Gregg  on   the  Republican  side  and  Conrad  on  the  Democratic  side    had  a  lot  of  Republican  cosponsors  to   the  idea.  I  hope  that,  despite  the  fact  that  it  got  voted  down  in  the  Senate,  that  both  the   Republican  Leader  Mitch  McConnell  and  the  Republican  Leader  in  the  House  John  Boehner  go   ahead  and  fully  embrace  what  has  been  a  bipartisan  idea  to  get  our  arms  around  this  budget.   That's  also  why  we're  restoring  pay  as  you  go:  a  simple  rule  that  says  Congress  can't  spend  a   dime  without  cutting  a  dime  elsewhere.  This  rule  helped  lead  to  the  budget  surpluses  of  the   1990s,  and  it's  one  of  the  most  important  steps  we  can  take  to  restore  fiscal  discipline  in   Washington.   You  can  read  more  about  the  budget  at  budget.gov        very  easy  to  remember         budget.gov.  But  the  bottom  line  is  this:  We  simply  cannot  continue  to  spend  as  if  deficits  don't   have  consequences    as  if  waste  doesn't  matter    as  if  the  hard  earned  tax  dollars  of  the   American  people  can  be  treated  like  Monopoly  money    as  if  we  can  ignore  this  challenge  for   another  generation.  We  can't.   In  order  to  meet  this  challenge,  I  welcome  any  idea,  from  Democrats  and  Republicans.  What  I   will  not  welcome        what  I  reject        is  the  same  old  grandstanding  when  the  cameras  are  on,   and  the  same  irresponsible  budget  policies  when  the  cameras  are  off.  It's  time  to  hold   Washington  to  the  same  standards  families  and  businesses  hold  themselves.  It's  time  to  save   what  we  can,  spend  what  we  must,  and  live  within  our  means  once  again.   Thanks  very  much. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.

"Thank you. Thank you very much. Please be seated. Thank you so much. Heads of state, Cabinet members, my outstanding Vice President,members of Congress, religious leaders, distinguished guests, Admiral Mullen -- it's good tosee all of you. Let me begin by acknowledging the co-chairs of this breakfast, SenatorsIsakson and Klobuchar, who embody the sense of fellowship at the heart of this gathering.They're two of my favorite senators. Let me also acknowledge the director of my faith-basedoffice, Joshua DuBois, who is here. Where's Joshua? He's out there somewhere. He's doinggreat work. I want to commend Secretary Hillary Clinton on her outstanding remarks, and her outstandingleadership at the State Department. She's doing good every day. I'm especially pleased to seemy dear friend, Prime Minister Zapatero, and I want him to relay America's greetings to thepeople of Spain. And Johnny, you are right, I'm deeply blessed, and I thank God every day forbeing married to Michelle Obama. I'm privileged to join you once again, as my predecessors have for over half a century. Likethem, I come here to speak about the ways my faith informs who I am -- as a President, andas a person. But I'm also here for the same reason that all of you are, for we all share arecognition -- one as old as time -- that a willingness to believe, an openness to grace, acommitment to prayer can bring sustenance to our lives. There is, of course, a need for prayer even in times of joy and peace and prosperity. Perhapsespecially in such times prayer is needed -- to guard against pride and to guard againstcomplacency. But rightly or wrongly, most of us are inclined to seek out the divine not in themoment when the Lord makes His face shine upon us, but in moments when God's grace canseem farthest away. Last month, God's grace, God's mercy, seemed far away from our neighbors in Haiti. And yet Ibelieve that grace was not absent in the midst of tragedy. It was heard in prayers and hymnsthat broke the silence of an earthquake's wake. It was witnessed among parishioners ofchurches that stood no more, a roadside congregation, holding bibles in their laps. It was feltin the presence of relief workers and medics; translators; servicemen and women, bringingwater and food and aid to the injured. One such translator was an American of Haitian descent, representative of the extraordinarywork that our men and women in uniform do all around the world -- Navy Corpsman Christian[sic] Brossard. And lying on a gurney aboard the USNS Comfort, a woman asked Christopher: ""Where do you come from? What country? After my operation,"" she said, ""I will pray for thatcountry."" And in Creole, Corpsman Brossard responded, ""Etazini."" The United States ofAmerica. God's grace, and the compassion and decency of the American people is expressed throughthe men and women like Corpsman Brossard. It's expressed through the efforts of our ArmedForces, through the efforts of our entire government, through similar efforts from Spain andother countries around the world. It's also, as Secretary Clinton said, expressed throughmultiple faith-based efforts. By evangelicals at World Relief. By the American Jewish WorldService. By Hindu temples, and mainline Protestants, Catholic Relief Services, AfricanAmerican churches, the United Sikhs. By Americans of every faith, and no faith, unitingaround a common purpose, a higher purpose. It's inspiring. This is what we do, as Americans, in times of trouble. We unite, recognizing thatsuch crises call on all of us to act, recognizing that there but for the grace of God go I,recognizing that life's most sacred responsibility -- one affirmed, as Hillary said, by all of theworld's great religions -- is to sacrifice something of ourselves for a person in need. Sadly, though, that spirit is too often absent when tackling the long-term, but no lessprofound issues facing our country and the world. Too often, that spirit is missing without thespectacular tragedy, the 9/11 or the Katrina, the earthquake or the tsunami, that can shakeus out of complacency. We become numb to the day-to-day crises, the slow-moving tragediesof children without food and men without shelter and families without health care. We becomeabsorbed with our abstract arguments, our ideological disputes, our contests for power. And inthis Tower of Babel, we lose the sound of God's voice. Now, for those of us here in Washington, let's acknowledge that democracy has always beenmessy. Let's not be overly nostalgic. Divisions are hardly new in this country. Argumentsabout the proper role of government, the relationship between liberty and equality, ourobligations to our fellow citizens -- these things have been with us since our founding. And I'mprofoundly mindful that a loyal opposition, a vigorous back and forth, a skepticism of power,all of that is what makes our democracy work. And we've seen actually some improvement in some circumstances. We haven't seen anycanings on the floor of the Senate any time recently. So we shouldn't over-romanticize thepast. But there is a sense that something is different now; that something is broken; thatthose of us in Washington are not serving the people as well as we should. At times, it seemslike we're unable to listen to one another; to have at once a serious and civil debate. And thiserosion of civility in the public square sows division and distrust among our citizens. It poisonsthe well of public opinion. It leaves each side little room to negotiate with the other. It makespolitics an all-or-nothing sport, where one side is either always right or always wrong when, inreality, neither side has a monopoly on truth. And then we lose sight of the children withoutfood and the men without shelter and the families without health care. Empowered by faith, consistently, prayerfully, we need to find our way back to civility. Thatbegins with stepping out of our comfort zones in an effort to bridge divisions. We see that inmany conservative pastors who are helping lead the way to fix our broken immigrationsystem. It's not what would be expected from them, and yet they recognize, in thoseimmigrant families, the face of God. We see that in the evangelical leaders who are rallyingtheir congregations to protect our planet. We see it in the increasing recognition amongprogressives that government can't solve all of our problems, and that talking about valueslike responsible fatherhood and healthy marriage are integral to any anti-poverty agenda.Stretching out of our dogmas, our prescribed roles along the political spectrum, that can helpus regain a sense of civility. Civility also requires relearning how to disagree without being disagreeable; understanding, asPresident [Kennedy] said, that ""civility is not a sign of weakness."" Now, I am the first toconfess I am not always right. Michelle will testify to that. But surely you can question mypolicies without questioning my faith, or, for that matter, my citizenship. Challenging each other's ideas can renew our democracy. But when we challenge each other'smotives, it becomes harder to see what we hold in common. We forget that we share at somedeep level the same dreams -- even when we don't share the same plans on how to fulfillthem. We may disagree about the best way to reform our health care system, but surely we canagree that no one ought to go broke when they get sick in the richest nation on Earth. We cantake different approaches to ending inequality, but surely we can agree on the need to lift ourchildren out of ignorance; to lift our neighbors from poverty. We may disagree about gay marriage, but surely we can agree that it is unconscionable totarget gays and lesbians for who they are -- whether it's here in the United States or, asHillary mentioned, more extremely in odious laws that are being proposed most recently inUganda. Surely we can agree to find common ground when possible, parting ways when necessary. Butin doing so, let us be guided by our faith, and by prayer. For while prayer can buck us upwhen we are down, keep us calm in a storm; while prayer can stiffen our spines to surmountan obstacle -- and I assure you I'm praying a lot these days -- prayer can also do somethingelse. It can touch our hearts with humility. It can fill us with a spirit of brotherhood. It canremind us that each of us are children of a awesome and loving God. Through faith, but not through faith alone, we can unite people to serve the commongood. And that's why my Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships has beenworking so hard since I announced it here last year. We've slashed red tape and built effectivepartnerships on a range of uses, from promoting fatherhood here at home to spearheadinginterfaith cooperation abroad. And through that office we've turned the faith-based initiativearound to find common ground among people of all beliefs, allowing them to make an impactin a way that's civil and respectful of difference and focused on what matters most. It is this spirit of civility that we are called to take up when we leave here today. That's whatI'm praying for. I know in difficult times like these -- when people are frustrated, whenpundits start shouting and politicians start calling each other names -- it can seem like areturn to civility is not possible, like the very idea is a relic of some bygone era. The worditself seems quaint -- civility. But let us remember those who came before; those who believed in the brotherhood of maneven when such a faith was tested. Remember Dr. Martin Luther King. Not long after anexplosion ripped through his front porch, his wife and infant daughter inside, he rose to thatpulpit in Montgomery and said, ""Love is the only force capable of transforming an enemy intoa friend."" In the eyes of those who denied his humanity, he saw the face of God. Remember Abraham Lincoln. On the eve of the Civil War, with states seceding and forcesgathering, with a nation divided half slave and half free, he rose to deliver his first Inauguraland said, ""We are not enemies, but friends   Though passion may have strained, it must notbreak our bonds of affection."" Even in the eyes of confederate soldiers, he saw the face of God. Remember William Wilberforce, whose Christian faith led him to seek slavery's abolition inBritain; he was vilified, derided, attacked; but he called for ""lessening prejudices [and]conciliating good-will, and thereby making way for the less obstructed progress of truth."" In the eyes of those who sought to silence a nation's conscience, he saw the face of God. Yes, there are crimes of conscience that call us to action. Yes, there are causes that move ourhearts and offenses that stir our souls. But progress doesn't come when we demonizeopponents. It's not born in righteous spite. Progress comes when we open our hearts, whenwe extend our hands, when we recognize our common humanity. Progress comes when welook into the eyes of another and see the face of God. That we might do so -- that we will doso all the time, not just some of the time -- is my fervent prayer for our nation and the world. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.",obama
"Hello, everybody. I am glad to see that all of you braved the weather to be here. A little while ago I had ameeting with the Democratic and Republican congressional leaders, and it went very well. In fact, Iunderstand that McConnell and Reid are out doing snow angels on the South Lawn together. Can youpicture that, Chuck? Not really? The meeting did go well, and I appreciate them making the trek. We had a good and frank conversation andit's one that I hope we can continue on a more regular basis. We all understand that there are legitimate and genuine differences between the parties, but despite thepolitical posturing that often paralyzes this town, there are many issues upon which we can and shouldagree. That's what the American people are demanding of us. I think they're tired of every day beingElection Day in Washington. And at this critical time in our country, the people sent us here expect aseriousness of purpose that transcends petty politics. That's why I'm going to continue to seek the best ideas from either party as we work to tackle the pressingchallenges ahead. I am confident, for example, that when one in 10 of our fellow citizens can't work, weshould be able to come together and help business create more jobs. We ought to be able to agree onproviding small businesses with additional tax credits and much needed lines of credit. We ought to agreeon investments in crumbling roads and bridges, and we should agree on tax breaks for making homes moreenergy-efficient -- all of which will put more Americans to work. Many of the job proposals that I've laid out have passed the House and are soon going to be debated in theSenate. We spent a lot of time in this meeting discussing a jobs package and how we could move forwardon that. And if there are additional ideas, I will consider them as well. What I won't consider is doingnothing in the face of a lot of hardship across the country. We also talked about restoring fiscal responsibility. There are few matters on which there is as muchvigorous bipartisan agreement, at least in public, but unfortunately there's also a lot of partisan wranglingbehind closed doors. This is what we know for sure: For us to solve this extraordinary problem that is somany years in the making, it's going to take the cooperation of both parties. It's not going to happen in anyother way. I'm pleased that Congress supported my request to restore the pay-as-you-go rule, which was instrumentalin turning deficits into surpluses during the 1990s. I've also called for a bipartisan fiscal commission. Unfortunately this measure, which originally had received the support of a bipartisan majority of the Senateand was cosponsored by Senators Conrad and Gregg, Democrats and Republicans, was blocked there. SoI'm going to be creating this commission by executive order. And during our meeting I asked the leadershipof both parties to join in this serious effort to address our long-term deficits, because when the politics is putaside, the reality of our fiscal challenge is not subject to interpretation. Math is not partisan. There ought tobe a debate about how to close our deficits. What we can't accept is business as usual, and we can't affordgrandstanding at the expense of actually getting something done. During our meeting we also touched briefly on how we can move forward on health reform. I've alreadyannounced that in two weeks I'll be holding a meeting with people from both parties, and as I told thecongressional leadership, I'm looking forward to a constructive debate with plans that need to be measuredagainst this test. Does it bring down costs for all Americans as well as for the federal government, whichspends a huge amount on health care? Does it provide adequate protection against abuses by theinsurance industry? Does it make coverage affordable and available to the tens of millions of workingAmericans who don't have it right now? And does it help us get on a path of fiscal sustainability? We also talked about why this is so urgent. Just this week, there was a report that Anthem Blue Cross,which is the largest insurer in the largest state, California, is planning on raising premiums for manyindividual policyholders by as much as 39 percent. If we don't act, this is just a preview of comingattractions. Premiums will continue to rise for folks with insurance; millions more will lose their coveragealtogether; our deficits will continue to grow larger. And we have an obligation -- both parties -- to tackle thisissue in a serious way. Now, bipartisanship depends on a willingness among both Democrats and Republicans to put aside mattersof party for the good of the country. I won't hesitate to embrace a good idea from my friends in the minorityparty, but I also won't hesitate to condemn what I consider to be obstinacy that's rooted not in substantivedisagreements but in political expedience. We talked about this as well, particularly when it comes to theconfirmation process. I respect the Senate's role to advise and consent, but for months, qualified, non-controversial nominees for critical positions in government, often positions related to our national security,have been held up despite having overwhelming support. My nominee for one important job, the head ofGeneral Services Administration, which helps run the government, was denied a vote for nine months. When she finally got a vote on her nomination, she was confirmed 96 to nothing. That's not advise andconsent; that's delay and obstruct. One senator, as you all are aware, had put a hold on every single nominee that we had put forward due to adispute over a couple of earmarks in his state. In our meeting, I asked the congressional leadership to put astop to these holds in which nominees for critical jobs are denied a vote for months. Surely we can setaside partisanship and do what's traditionally been done to confirm these nominations. If the Senate doesnot act -- and I made this very clear -- if the Senate does not act to confirm these nominees, I will considermaking several recess appointments during the upcoming recess, because we can't afford to allow politicsto stand in the way of a well-functioning government. My hope is that this will be the first of a series of meetings that I have with leadership of both parties inCongress. We've got to get past the tired debates that have plagued our politics and left behind nothing butsoaring debt and mounting challenges, greater hardships among the American people, and extraordinaryfrustrations among the American people. Those frustrations are what led me to run for President, and aslong as I'm here in Washington, I intend to try to make this government work on their behalf. So, you know, I'm going to take a couple of questions, guys. Major. Question: After meeting with you, John Boehner came out and told us, ""The House can't pass the healthcare bill it once passed; the Senate can't pass the health care bill it once passed. Why would we have aconversation about legislation that can't pass?"" As a part of that, he said you and your White House andcongressional Democrats should start over entirely from scratch on health care reform. How do yourespond? Are you willing to do that? President Obama: Well, here's how I responded to John in the meeting, and I've said this publicly before. There are some core goals that have to be met. We've got to control costs, both for families andbusinesses, but also for our government. Everybody out there who talks about deficits has to acknowledgethat the single biggest driver of our deficits is health care spending. We cannot deal with our deficits anddebt long term unless we get a handle on that. So that has to be part of a package. Number two, we've got to deal with insurance abuses that affect millions of Americans who've got healthinsurance. And number three, we've got to make health insurance more available to folks in the individualmarket, as I just mentioned, in California, who are suddenly seeing their premiums go up 39 percent. Thatapplies to the majority of small businesses, as well as sole proprietors. They are struggling. So I've got these goals. Now, we have a package, as we work through the differences between the Houseand the Senate, and we'll put it up on a Web site for all to see over a long period of time, that meets thosecriteria, meets those goals. But when I was in Baltimore talking to the House Republicans, they indicated,we can accomplish some of these goals at no cost. And I said, great, let me see it. And I have no interestin doing something that's more expensive and harder to accomplish if somebody else has an easier way todo it. So I'm going to be starting from scratch in the sense that I will be open to any ideas that help promote thesegoals. What I will not do, what I don't think makes sense and I don't think the American people want to see, wouldbe another year of partisan wrangling around these issues; another six months or eight months or ninemonths worth of hearings in every single committee in the House and the Senate in which there's a lot ofposturing. Let's get the relevant parties together; let's put the best ideas on the table. My hope is that wecan find enough overlap that we can say this is the right way to move forward, even if I don't get everysingle thing that I want. But here's the point that I made to John Boehner and Mitch McConnell: Bipartisanship can't be that I agreeto all the things that they believe in or want, and they agree to none of the things I believe in and want, andthat's the price of bipartisanship, right? But that's sometimes the way it gets presented. Mitch McConnellsaid something very nice in the meeting about how he supports our goals on nuclear energy and clean coaltechnology and more drilling to increase oil production. Well, of course he likes that; that's part of theRepublican agenda for energy, which I accept. And I'm willing to move off some of the preferences of myparty in order to meet them halfway. But there's got to be some give from their side as well. That's true onhealth care; that's true on energy; that's true on financial reform. That's what I'm hoping gets accomplishedat the summit. Question: Do you agree the House and Senate bill can't pass anymore? President Obama: What I agree with is that the public has soured on the process that they saw over thelast year. I think that actually contaminates how they view the substance of the bills. I think it is importantfor all of these issues to be aired so that people have confidence if we're moving forward on such asignificant part of the economy as health care, that there is complete transparency and all of these issueshave been adequately vetted and adequately debated. And this gives an opportunity not just for Democrats to say here's what we think we should do, but it alsogives Republicans a showcase before the entire country to say here's our plan; here's why we think this willwork. And one of the things that John Boehner and Mitch McConnell both said is they didn't think that thestatus quo was acceptable, and that's, right there, promising. That indicates that if all sides agree that wecan't just continue with business as usual then maybe we can actually get something done. Question: Mr. President, one of the reasons Anthem said -- Anthem Blue Cross says that it's raising itspremiums is because so many people are dropping out of individual coverage because the economy is sobad and that leaves the people in the pool who are people who need medical care driving up costs. One ofthe reasons why businesses are not expanding right now, in addition to some of the credit issues you'vetalked about, at least according to business leaders, is they say there's an uncertainty of what they need toplan for because of the energy bill, because of health care. That's what they say. I'm not saying it's true ornot, but that's what they say. What do you say when you hear that? President Obama: Well, I think that the biggest uncertainty has been we just went through the worstrecession since the Great Depression and people weren't sure whether the financial system was going tomelt down and whether we were going to tip into a endless recession. So let's be clear about the sources ofuncertainty in terms of business investment over the last several years: A huge contraction, trillions ofdollars of losses in people's 401(k)s; people have a lot of debt coming out of the previous decade that theystill haven't worked out; the housing market losing a whole bunch of value. So the good news is that where we were contracting by 6 percent the economy is now growing by 6percent. The CEOs I talked to are saying they are now making investments, and I anticipate that they'regoing to start hiring at a more rapid clip. What I've also heard is them saying that we would like to feel likeWashington is working and able to get some things done. There are two ways of interpreting the issue of uncertainty. One way would be to say, well, you know what,we'll just go back to what we were doing before on, let's say, the financial markets. We won't have theregulations that we need; we won't make any changes in terms of ""too big to fail."" That will provide certainty-- until the next financial crisis. That's not the kind of certainty I think that the financial markets need. The kind of certainty they need is forus to go ahead and agree on a bipartisan effort to put some rules of the road in place so that consumers areprotected in the financial markets; so that we don't have banks that are too big to fail; that we have ways ofwinding them down and protecting the overall system without taxpayer bailouts. That requires legislation. The sooner we can get that done, the better. The same would be true when it comes to health care. A lot of CEOs I hear from will say, boy, we'd like youto get health care settled one way or another, but they will acknowledge that when they open up their latestinvoice for their premiums and they find out that those premiums have gone up 20 percent or 25 percent,that's the kind of uncertainty that also tamps down business investment. So I guess my answer would be this: The sooner the business community has a sense that we've got ouract together here in Washington and can move forward on big, serious issues in a substantive way without alot of posturing and partisan wrangling, I think the better off the entire country is going to be. I absolutelyagree on that. What I think is important is not to buy into this notion that is perpetrated by some of the business intereststhat got a stake in this who are fighting financial reform, for example, to say, boy, we'd be doing fine if wejust didn't try to regulate the banks. That I think would be a mistake. Question: Just to play devil's advocate on that -- a small business, let's say, not somebody who's going tobe affected by the regulatory reform, small business -- you have proposed, you would acknowledge, a boldagenda. And a small business might wonder, I don't know how the energy bill is going to affect me, I don'tknow how the health care reform bill is going to affect me -- I'd better hold off on hiring. President Obama: The small businesses I talk to -- and I've been talking to a lot of them as I've beentraveling around the country over the last several months -- their biggest problem is right now they can't getcredit out of their banks so they're uncertain about that. And they're still uncertain about orders -- do theyjust have enough customers to justify them doing more. It's looking better at this point. But that's not the rationale for people saying, I'm not hiring. Let me put it thisway. Most small businesses right now, if they've got enough customers to make a profit and they can getthe bank loans required to boost their payroll, boost their inventory, and sell to those customers, they will doso. Okay? Let's see, let's get a print guy here. David. Question: You heard McConnell talk about nuclear power, offshore drilling, free trade -- that's a lot ofRepublican stuff. Is your party going to go for that if you decide to support that -- President Obama: You know, I think that on energy there should be a bipartisan agreement that we haveto take a both/and approach rather than an either/or approach. What do I mean by that? I am very firm inmy conviction that the country that leads the way in clean energy -- solar, wind, biodiesel, geothermal -- thatcountry is going to win the race in the 21st century global economy. So we have to move in that direction. What is also true is that given our energy needs in order to continue economic growth, produce jobs, makesure our businesses are competitive around the world, that we're going to need some of the old, traditionalenergy sources as we're developing these new ones and ramping them up. So we can't overnight convertto an all-solar or an all-wind economy. That just can't happen. We're going to have needs in thesetraditional sources. And so the question then is, are we going to be able to put together a package that includes safe, securenuclear power; that includes new technologies so that we can use coal -- which we have in abundance andis very cheap, but often is adding to our greenhouse gases -- can we find sequestration technologies thatclean that up; can we identify opportunities to increase our oil and natural gas production in a way that isenvironmentally sustainable? And that should be part of a package with our development of clean energy. And my hope is that my Republican friends, but also Democrats, say to themselves, let's be practical andlet's do both. Let's not just do one or the other; let's do both. Over time I think the transition is going to bemore and more clean energy and over time fossil fuels become less prominent in our overall energy mix. But we've got to do both. Question: How confident are you there will be that kind of consensus for that double-edged approach? President Obama: I am just a eternal optimist -- and so -- it's the right thing to do. And all I can do is justto keep on making the argument about what's right for the country and assume that over time people,regardless of party, regardless of their particular political positions, are going to gravitate towards the truth. Okay? I'm going to take two more. Let's see -- Question: How about the back? President Obama: Well, I just want to make sure that I was getting a balance here, so -- go ahead, Chuck. Question: Awwww -- President Obama: Why is everybody moaning about Todd? Question: He's too good. His questions are too precise. Question: Iran -- we got the news today that they're doing more of these -- trying to enhance this uraniumeven more. Obviously Secretary Gates today in Paris was quoted as saying basically the dialogue seems tobe over and now the question is sanctions. Where are we on sanctions? How close is this? I know youhad sort of an end-of-the-year deadline when you stood up there with Sarkozy and Brown. It's nowFebruary. How quickly is this moving along? President Obama: Well, it's moving along fairly quickly. I think that we have bent over backwards to say tothe Islamic Republic of Iran that we are willing to have a constructive conversation about how they can alignthemselves with international norms and rules and reenter as full members of the international community. The most obvious attempt was when we gave them an offer that said we are going to provide theconversion of some of the low-enriched uranium that they already have into the isotopes that they need fortheir medical research and for hospitals that would serve up to a million Iranian citizens. They rejected it --although one of the difficulties in dealing with Iran over the last several months is it's not always clear who'sspeaking on behalf of the government, and we get a lot of different, mixed signals. But what's clear is, isthat they have not said yes to an agreement that Russia, China, Germany, France, Great Britain and theUnited States all said was a good deal, and that the director of the IAEA said was the right thing to do andthat Iran should accept. That indicates to us that, despite their posturing that their nuclear power is only for civilian use, that they infact continue to pursue a course that would lead to weaponization. And that is not acceptable to theinternational community, not just to the United States. So what we've said from the start was we're movingon dual tracks. If you want to accept the kinds of agreements with the international community that lead youdown a path of being a member of good standing, then we welcome you. If not -- Question: Haven't they responded, though? I mean, by deciding to do what they did, with these -- President Obama: Well, I'm getting to that. Question: Okay. President Obama: And if not, then the next step is sanctions. They have made their choice so far,although the door is still open. And what we are going to be working on over the next several weeks isdeveloping a significant regime of sanctions that will indicate to them how isolated they are from theinternational community as a whole. Question: What do you mean by    regime of sanctions   ? President Obama: Well, meaning that there's going to be a -- Question: Some will be U.N. and some will be -- President Obama: We are going to be looking at a variety of ways in which countries indicate to Iran thattheir approach is unacceptable. And the U.N. will be one aspect of that broader effort. Question: China will be there? You're confident? President Obama: Well, the -- we are confident right now that the international community is unifiedaround Iran's misbehavior in this area. How China operates at the Security Council as we pursue sanctionsis something that we're going to have to see. One thing I'm pleased about is to see how forward-leaning theRussians have been on this issue. I think they clearly have seen that Iran hasn't been serious about solvingwhat is a solvable dispute between Iran and the international community. All right? I'm going to make this the last question. And I'll take somebody from the back -- yes. Question: Me? President Obama: Yes. Question: Thanks for doing this. It's been a while. On health care, the Republicans are asking whetherthe February 25th session will include economists and public interest groups and people supporting yourside, or will it just be the members of Congress? And on Anthem Blue Cross, do you have the authority togo in and tell a private company they can't charge that -- how will you stop them? President Obama: Well, I don't have the authority as I understand it -- I can't simply issue an executiveorder lowering everybody's rates. If I could I would have done that already and saved myself a lot of griefon Capitol Hill. That's why reform is so important. That's why the status quo is unacceptable. But there is no shortcut in dealing with this issue. I know the American people get frustrated in debatingsomething like health care because you get a whole bunch of different claims being made by differentgroups and different interests. It is a big, complicated, tough issue. But what is also true is that withoutsome action on the part of Congress, it is very unlikely that we see any improvement over the currenttrajectory. And the current trajectory is premiums keep on going up 10, 15, 20, 30 percent. The currenttrajectory is more and more people are losing health care. I don't know if people noted, because during the health care debate everybody was saying the President istrying to take over -- a government takeover of health care. I don't know if anybody noticed that for the firsttime this year you saw more people getting health care from government than you did from the privatesector -- not because of anything we did, but because more and more people are losing their health carefrom their employers. It's becoming unaffordable. That's what we're trying to prevent. We want people to be able to get health care from their employers. But we also understand that you've gotto fix the system so that people are able to get it at affordable rates and small businesses can afford to givetheir employees insurance at an affordable rate. And that's not happening right now. To your question about the 25th, my hope is that this doesn't end up being political theater, as I think someof you have phrased it. I want a substantive discussion. We haven't refined exactly how the agenda isgoing to go that day. We want to talk with both the Democratic and Republican leaders to find out what theythink would be most useful. I do want to make sure that there's some people like the Congressional BudgetOffice, for example, that are considered non-partisan, who can answer questions. In this whole health care debate I'm reminded of the story that was told about Senator Moynihan, who was Iguess in an argument with one of his colleagues, and his colleague was losing the argument so he got alittle flustered and said to Senator Moynihan, ""Well, I'm entitled to my own opinion."" And Senator Moynihansaid, ""Well, you're entitled to your own opinion, but you're not entitled to your own facts."" I think that's thekey to a successful dialogue on the 25th or on health care. Let's establish some common facts. Let's establish what the issues are, what the problems are, and let'stest out in front of the American people what ideas work and what ideas don't. And if we can establish thatfactual accuracy about how different approaches would work, then I think we can make some progress. And it may be that some of the facts that come up are ones that make my party a little bit uncomfortable. Soif it's established that by working seriously on medical malpractice and tort reform that we can reduce someof those costs, I've said from the beginning of this debate I'd be willing to work on that. On the other hand, ifI'm told that that is only a fraction of the problem and that is not the biggest driver of health care costs, thenI'm also going to insist, okay, let's look at that as one aspect of it, but what else are we willing to do? And this is where it gets back to the point I was making earlier. Bipartisanship cannot mean simply thatDemocrats give up everything that they believe in, find the handful of things that Republicans have beenadvocating for and we do those things, and then we have bipartisanship. That's not how it works in anyother realm of life. That's certainly not how it works in my marriage with Michelle, although I usually do givein most of the time. But the -- there's got to be some give and take, and that's what I'm hoping can beaccomplished. And I'm confident that's what the American people are looking for. So, all right? Question: Jobs question? President Obama: Okay, since there wasn't a jobs question -- Question: Well, I just -- President Obama: I'll make this the last one, jobs question. Question: At the stakeout, the Republicans were saying, well, the jobs package we've seen, it's not reallyready yet, we're a little worried about the cost. Are you satisfied that there is something that can be quicklymoved through Congress on jobs? President Obama: Well, my understanding is -- first of all, the House has moved forward a jobs packagethat has some good elements in it. My understanding is, is that there is bipartisan talks taking place as wespeak on the Senate side about some elements of a package. I think there are some things that a lot of people agree on. Just to give you an example, the idea ofeliminating capital gains for small businesses -- something we can all agree on. I talked about it at the Stateof the Union address. My hope would be that we would all agree on a mechanism to get community bankswho are lending to small businesses more capital, because that is something that I keep on hearing is oneof the biggest problems that small businesses have out there. So I think that it's realistic for us to get a package moving quickly that may not include all the things I thinkneed to be done, and it may be that that first package builds some trust and confidence that Democrats andRepublicans on Capitol Hill can work together and then we move on to the next aspect of the package andso forth. It may take a series of incremental steps, but the one thing I'm absolutely clear about is, is thatwe've got an economy that's growing right now, a huge boost in productivity -- that's the good news. Thebad news is, is that companies still haven't taken that final step in actually putting people on their payroll full- time. We're seeing an increase in temporary workers, but they haven't yet taken on that full-time worker. And soproviding some additional impetus to them, right as the economy is moving in a positive direction, I think canend up yielding some good results. All right? Thank you, guys. That was pretty good, thanks.",obama
"Thank you so much, all of you, for joining us today. And I want to thank Julie, Barbara, Roland, Stephen,Renee, and Christopher, standing behind me -- physicians, physicians assistants, and nurses whounderstand how important it is for us to make much needed changes in our health care system. I want to thank all of you who are here today. I want to specially recognize two people who have beenworking tirelessly on that -- on this effort, my Secretary of Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius --as well as our quarterback for health reform out of the White House, Nancy-Ann DeParle. We began our push to reform health insurance last March, in this room, with doctors and nurses who knowthe system best. And so it   s fitting to be joined by all of you as we bring this journey to a close. Last Thursday, I spent seven hours at a summit where Democrats and Republicans engaged in a public andvery substantive discussion about health care. This meeting capped off a debate that began with a similarsummit nearly one year ago. And since then, every idea has been put on the table. Every argument hasbeen made. Everything there is to say about health care has been said -- and just about everybody hassaid it. So now is the time to make a decision about how to finally reform health care so that it works, notjust for the insurance companies, but for America   s families and America   s businesses. Now, where both sides say they agree is that the status quo is not working for the American people. Healthinsurance is becoming more expensive by the day. Families can   t afford it. Businesses can   t afford it. Thefederal government can   t afford it. Smaller businesses and individuals who don   t get coverage at work aresqueezed especially hard. And insurance companies freely ration health care based on who   s sick andwho   s healthy; who can pay and who can   t. That's the status quo. That's the system we have right now. Democrats and Republicans agree that this is a serious problem for America. And we agree that if we donothing -- if we throw up our hands and walk away -- it   s a problem that will only grow worse. Nobodydisputes that. More Americans will lose their family's health insurance if they switch jobs or lose their job. More small businesses will be forced to choose between health care and hiring. More insurance companieswill deny people coverage who have preexisting conditions, or they'll drop people's coverage when they getsick and need it most. And the rising cost of Medicare and Medicaid will sink our government deeper anddeeper and deeper into debt. On all of this we agree. So the question is, what do we do about it? On one end of the spectrum, there are some who've suggested scrapping our system of private insuranceand replacing it with a government-run health care system. And though many other countries have such asystem, in America it would be neither practical nor realistic. On the other end of the spectrum, there are those, and this includes most Republicans in Congress, whobelieve the answer is to loosen regulations on the insurance industry -- whether it's state consumerprotections or minimum standards for the kind of insurance they can sell. The argument is, is that that willsomehow lower costs. I disagree with that approach. I'm concerned that this would only give the insuranceindustry even freer rein to raise premiums and deny care. So I don't believe we should give government bureaucrats or insurance company bureaucrats more controlover health care in America. I believe it's time to give the American people more control over their healthcare and their health insurance. I don't believe we can afford to leave life-and-death decisions about healthcare to the discretion of insurance company executives alone. I believe that doctors and nurses andphysician assistants like the ones in this room should be free to decide what's best for their patients. Now, the proposal I put forward gives Americans more control over their health insurance and their healthcare by holding insurance companies more accountable. It builds on the current system where mostAmericans get their health insurance from their employer. If you like your plan, you can keep your plan. Ifyou like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. I can tell you as the father of two young girls, I would notwant any plan that interferes with the relationship between a family and their doctor. Essentially, my proposal would change three things about the current health care system. First, it wouldend the worst practices of insurance companies. No longer would they be able to deny your coveragebecause of a preexisting condition. No longer would they be able to drop your coverage because you gotsick. No longer would they be able to force you to pay unlimited amounts of money out of your own pocket. No longer would they be able to arbitrarily and massively raise premiums like Anthem Blue Cross recentlytried to do in California -- up to 39 percent increases in one year in the individual market. Those practiceswould end. Second, my proposal would give uninsured individuals and small business owners the same kind of choiceof private health insurance that members of Congress get for themselves -- because if it   s good enough formembers of Congress, it   s good enough for the people who pay their salaries. The reason federal employees get a good deal on health insurance is that we all participate in an insurancemarket where insurance companies give better coverage and better rates, because they get morecustomers. It's an idea that many Republicans have embraced in the past, before politics intruded. And my proposal says that if you still can   t afford the insurance in this new marketplace, even though it'sgoing to provide better deals for people than they can get right now in the individual marketplace, then we'lloffer you tax credits to do so -- tax credits that add up to the largest middle-class tax cut for health care inhistory. After all, the wealthiest among us can already buy the best insurance there is, and the least well offare able to get coverage through Medicaid. So it's the middle class that gets squeezed, and that   s who wehave to help. Now, it is absolutely true that all of this will cost some money -- about $100 billion per year. But most of thiscomes from the nearly $2 trillion a year that America already spends on health care -- but a lot of it is notspent wisely. A lot of that money is being wasted or spent badly. So within this plan, we   re going to makesure the dollars we spend go towards making insurance more affordable and more secure. We   re going toeliminate wasteful taxpayer subsidies that currently go to insurance and pharmaceutical companies; set anew fee on insurance companies that stand to gain a lot of money and a lot of profits as millions ofAmericans are able to buy insurance; and we're going to make sure that the wealthiest Americans pay theirfair share on Medicare. The bottom line is our proposal is paid for. And all the new money generated in this plan goes back to smallbusinesses and middle-class families who can't afford health insurance. It would also lower prescriptiondrug prices for seniors. And it would help train new doctors and nurses and physician assistants to providecare for American families. Finally, my proposal would bring down the cost of health care for millions -- families, businesses, and thefederal government. We have now incorporated most of the serious ideas from across the politicalspectrum about how to contain the rising cost of health care -- ideas that go after the waste and abuse inour system, especially in programs like Medicare. But we do this while protecting Medicare benefits, andextending the financial stability of the program by nearly a decade. Our cost-cutting measures mirror most of the proposals in the current Senate bill, which reduces mostpeople's premiums and brings down our deficit by up to a trillion dollars over the next two decades -- bringsdown our deficit. Those aren't my numbers; those are the savings determined by the Congressional BudgetOffice, which is the Washington acronym for the nonpartisan, independent referee of Congress in terms ofhow much stuff costs. So that's our proposal. This is where we've ended up. It's an approach that has been debated andchanged and I believe improved over the last year. It incorporates the best ideas from Democrats andRepublicans -- including some of the ideas that Republicans offered during the health care summit, likefunding state grants on medical malpractice reform, and curbing waste and fraud and abuse in the healthcare system. My proposal also gets rid of many of the provisions that had no place in health care reform --provisions that were more about winning individual votes in Congress than improving health care for allAmericans. Now, despite all that we agree on and all the Republican ideas we've incorporated, many -- probably most --Republicans in Congress just have a fundamental disagreement over whether we should have more or lessoversight of insurance companies. And if they truly believe that less regulation would lead to higher quality,more affordable health insurance, then they should vote against the proposal I've put forward. Now, some also believe that we should, instead of doing what I'm proposing, pursue a piecemeal approachto health insurance reform, where we tinker around the edges of this challenge for the next few years. Eventhose who acknowledge the problem of the uninsured say we just can't afford to help them right now --which is why the Republican proposal only covers 3 million uninsured Americans while we cover over 31million. The problem with that approach is that unless everyone has access to affordable coverage, you can'tprevent insurance companies from denying coverage based on preexisting conditions; you can't limit theamount families are forced to pay out of their own pockets. The insurance reforms rest on everybodyhaving access to coverage. And you also don't do anything about the fact that taxpayers currently end upsubsidizing the uninsured when they're forced to go to the emergency room for care, to the tune of about athousand bucks per family. You can't get those savings if those people are still going to the emergencyroom. So the fact is, health reform only works if you take care of all of these problems at once. Now, both during and after last week's summit, Republicans in Congress insisted that the only acceptablecourse on health care reform is to start over. But given these honest and substantial differences betweenthe parties about the need to regulate the insurance industry and the need to help millions of middle-classfamilies get insurance, I don't see how another year of negotiations would help. Moreover, the insurance companies aren't starting over. They're continuing to raise premiums and denycoverage as we speak. For us to start over now could simply lead to delay that could last for anotherdecade, or even more. The American people, and the U.S. economy, just can't wait that long. So, nomatter which approach you favor, I believe the United States Congress owes the American people a finalvote on health care reform. We have debated this issue thoroughly, not just for the past year but for decades. Reform has alreadypassed the House with a majority. It has already passed the Senate with a supermajority of 60 votes. Andnow it deserves the same kind of up or down vote that was cast on welfare reform, that was cast on theChildren's Health Insurance Program, that was used for COBRA health coverage for the unemployed, and,by the way, for both Bush tax cuts -- all of which had to pass Congress with nothing more than a simplemajority. I, therefore, ask leaders in both houses of Congress to finish their work and schedule a vote in the next fewweeks. From now until then, I will do everything in my power to make the case for reform. And I urge everyAmerican who wants this reform to make their voice heard as well -- every family, every business, everypatient, every doctor, every nurse, every physician   s assistant. Make your voice heard. This has been a long and wrenching debate. It has stoked great passions among the American people andtheir representatives. And that's because health care is a difficult issue. It is a complicated issue. If it waseasy, it would have been solved long ago. As all of you know from experience, health care can literally bean issue of life or death. And as a result, it easily lends itself to demagoguery and political gamesmanship,and misrepresentation and misunderstanding. But that   s not an excuse for those of us who were sent here to lead. That's not an excuse for us to walkaway. We can   t just give up because the politics are hard. I know there   s been a fascination, bordering onobsession, in this media town about what passing health insurance reform would mean for the next electionand the one after that. How will this play? What will happen with the polls? I will leave it to others to siftthrough the politics, because that   s not what this is about. That   s not why we   re here. This is about what reform would mean for the mother with breast cancer whose insurance company willfinally have to pay for her chemotherapy. This is about what reform would mean for the small businessowner who will no longer have to choose between hiring more workers or offering coverage to theemployees she has. This is about what reform would mean for middle-class families who will be able toafford health insurance for the very first time in their lives and get a regular checkup once in a while, andhave some security about their children if they get sick. This is about what reform would mean for all those men and women I   ve met over the last few years who   vebeen brave enough to share their stories. When we started our push for reform last year, I talked to a youngmother in Wisconsin named Laura Klitzka. She has two young children. She thought she had beaten herbreast cancer but then later discovered it had spread to her bones. She and her husband were working andhad insurance, but their medical bills still landed them in debt. And now she spends time worrying aboutthat debt when all she wants to do is spend time with her children and focus on getting well. This should not happen in the United States of America. And it doesn   t have to. In the end, that's what this debate is about. It's about what kind of country we want to be. It's about themillions of lives that would be touched and, in some cases, saved by making private health insurance moresecure and more affordable. So at stake right now is not just our ability to solve this problem, but our ability to solve any problem. TheAmerican people want to know if it's still possible for Washington to look out for their interests and theirfuture. They are waiting for us to act. They are waiting for us to lead. And as long as I hold this office, Iintend to provide that leadership. I do not know how this plays politically, but I know it's right. And so I askCongress to finish its work, and I look forward to signing this reform into law. Thank you very much, everybody. Let's get it done.",obama
"Lost in the news of the week was a headline that ought to be a source of concern for everyAmerican. It said,    Many Nations Passing U.S. in Education.    Now, debates in Washingtontend to be consumed with the politics of the moment: who   s up in the daily polls; whose partystands to gain in November. But what matters to you -- what matters to our country -- is notwhat happens in the next election, but what we do to lift up the next generation. And the factis, there are few issues that speak more directly to our long term success as a nation thanissues concerning the education we provide to our children. Our prosperity in the 20th century was fueled by an education system that helped grow themiddle class and unleash the talents of our people more fully and widely than at any time inour history. We built schools and focused on the teaching of math and science. We helped ageneration of veterans go to college through the GI Bill. We led the globe in producing collegegraduates, and in turn we led in producing ground-breaking technologies and scientificdiscoveries that lifted living standards and set us apart as the world   s engine of innovation. Of course, other nations recognize this, and are looking to gain an edge in the globalmarketplace by investing in better schools, supporting teachers, and committing to clearstandards that will produce graduates with more skills. Our competitors understand that thenation that out-educates us today will out-compete us tomorrow. Yet, too often we havefailed to make inroads in reforming and strengthening our public education system -- thedebate mired in worn arguments hurled across entrenched divides. As a result, over the last few decades, we   ve lost ground. One assessment shows Americanfifteen year olds no longer even near the top in math and science when compared to theirpeers around the world. As referenced in the news report I mentioned, we   ve now fallenbehind most wealthy countries in our high school graduation rates. And while we once led theworld in the proportion of college graduates we produced, today we no longer do. Not only does that risk our leadership as a nation, it consigns millions of Americans to a lesserfuture. For we know that the level of education a person attains is increasingly a prerequisitefor success and a predictor of the income that person will earn throughout his or her life. Beyond the economic statistics is a less tangible but no less painful reality: unless we takeaction -- unless we step up -- there are countless children who will never realize their fulltalent and potential. I don   t accept that future for them. And I don   t accept that future for the United States ofAmerica. That   s why we   re engaged in a historic effort to redeem and improve our public schools: to raise the expectations for our students and for ourselves, to recognize and rewardexcellence, to improve performance in troubled schools, and to give our kids and our countrythe best chance to succeed in a changing world. Under the leadership of an outstanding Education Secretary, Arne Duncan, we launched aRace to the Top, through which states compete for funding by committing to reform andraising standards, by rewarding good teaching, by supporting the development of betterassessments to measure results, and by emphasizing math and science to help preparechildren for college and careers. And on Monday, my administration will send to Congress our blueprint for an updatedElementary and Secondary Education Act to overhaul No Child Left Behind. What this planrecognizes is that while the federal government can play a leading role in encouraging thereforms and high standards we need, the impetus for that change will come from states, andfrom local schools and school districts. So, yes, we set a high bar -- but we also provideeducators the flexibility to reach it. Under these guidelines, schools that achieve excellence or show real progress will berewarded, and local districts will be encouraged to commit to change in schools that areclearly letting their students down. For the majority of schools that fall in between -- schoolsthat do well but could do better -- we will encourage continuous improvement to help keepour young people on track for a bright future: prepared for the jobs of the 21st century. And because the most important factor in a child   s success is the person standing at the frontof the classroom, we will better prepare teachers, support teachers, and encourage teachersto stay in the field. In short, we   ll treat the people who educate our sons and daughters likethe professionals they are. Through this plan we are setting an ambitious goal: All students should graduate from highschool prepared for college and a career -- no matter who you are or where you come from. Achieving this goal will be difficult. It will take time. And it will require the skills, talents, anddedication of many: principals, teachers, parents, students. But this effort is essential for ourchildren and for our country. And while there will always be those cynics who claim it can   t bedone, at our best, we know that America has always risen to the challenges that we   ve faced. This challenge is no different. As a nation, we are engaged in many important endeavors: improving the economy,reforming the health care system, encouraging innovation in energy and other growthindustries of the 21st century. But our success in these efforts -- and our success in thefuture as a people -- will ultimately depend on what happens long before an entrepreneuropens his doors, or a nurse walks the rounds, or a scientist steps into her laboratory. Ourfuture is determined each and every day, when our children enter the classroom, ready tolearn and brimming with promise. It   s that promise we must help them fulfill. Thank you.",obama
"Mr. President, I rise, first, to offer strong words of support for the statement that was justoffered by the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts. I, as well, rise today to speak insupport of the Iraq resolution that the Senate will consider tomorrow. Mr. President, the news from Iraq is very bad. Last week, a suicide bomber stood outside abookstore and killed 20 people. Other attacks killed 118 Shia pilgrims. On Sunday, a car bombwent off in central Baghdad, and more than 30 people died. And the road from the airport intoBaghdad is littered with smoldering debris, craters from improvised explosive devices, and thememories of our sons and daughters. Mr. President, the civil war in Iraq rages on. The insurgents have started to change theirtactics. They hide in buildings and along the streets and wait for our helicopters. They've shotdown at least eight U.S. helicopters in the last month. More of our soldiers are dying andcoming home with their bodies broken and their nerves shattered at a VA system completelyunprepared for what they need to rebuild their lives. Mr. President, it is not enough for the President to tell us that victory in this war is simply amatter of American resolve. The American people have been extraordinarily resolved. They'veseen their sons and daughters killed or wounded in the streets of Fallujah. They've spenthundreds of billions of dollars on this effort -- money that they know could have been devotedto strengthening our homeland security and our competitive standing as a Nation. The failurehas not been a failure of resolve. That's not what's led us into chaos. It's been a failure ofstrategy; and it's time that the strategy change. There is no military solution, Mr. President, tothe civil war that rages on in Iraq; and it's time for us to redeploy so that a political solutionbecomes possible. The news from Iraq is very bad, and it's been that way for at least four years. We all wish the-- that the land the President and the Vice President speak of exists. We wish that there wasan Iraq where the insurgency was in the last throes, where the people work with security,where children play outside, where a vibrant new democracy lights up the nighttime sky. Wewish for those things, but there's no alternative reality to what we see and read about in thenews, to what we've experienced these long four years. I repeat, Mr. President, there is no military solution to this war. At this point, no amount ofsoldiers can solve the grievances at the heart of someone else's civil war. The Iraqi people --Shia, Sunni, and Kurd -- must come to the table and reach a political settlement themselves.If they want peace, they must do the hard work necessary to achieve it. Our failed strategy in Iraq has strengthened Iran's strategic position, reduced U.S. credibilityand influence around the world, placed Israel and other nations friendly to the United Statesin the region in greater peril. These are not the signs of a well-laid plan. It's time for aprofound change. This is what we're trying to do here today. We're saying it is time to start making plans toredeploy our troops so that they can focus on the wider struggle against terrorism, win thewar in Afghanistan, strengthen our position in the Middle East, and pressure the Iraqis toreach a political settlement. Even if this effort falls short, we will continue to try to accomplishwhat the American people asked for last November. I'm glad to see, though, that this new effort is gaining consensus. And I want to commendSenator Reid for his efforts. He took the time to listen -- so many of us from both Chambersof Congress could help develop this plan. The decision in particular to begin a phased redeployment, with the goal of redeploying all ourcombat forces by March 31st, 2008, is the right step. It's a measure the Iraq Study Groupspoke of, an idea I borrowed from them, an idea that, in a bill I introduced, now has morethan 60 cosponsors from House and Senate and from both sides of the aisle. They'vesupported this plan since I announced a similar plan in January. The decision allows some U.S. forces to remain in Iraq with a clear mission to protect U.S. andcoalition personnel, conduct counterterrorism operations, and to train and equip Iraqi forces;and that is a smart decision. President al-Maliki spoke at a conference and warned that theviolence in Iraq could spread throughout the region if it goes unchecked. By maintaining astrong presence in Iraq and the Middle East, as both my bill and the leadership bill does, wecan ensure that the chaos does not spread. I should also add that the decision to begin this phased redeployment within 120 days is apractical one. Our military options have been exhausted. It's time to seek a political solutionto this war, and with this decision we send a clear signal to the parties involved that they needto arrive at an accommodation. Mr. President, while I strongly believe that this war never should have been authorized, Ibelieve we must be as careful in ending the war as we were careless getting in. While I prefermy approach, as reflected in my bill, I believe that this new resolution does begin to pointU.S. policy in Iraq and the region in the right direction. An end to the war, and achieving apolitical solution to Iraq's civil war, will not happen unless we demand it. Peace with stability doesn't just happen because we wish for it. It comes when we never givein and never give up and never tire of working towards a life on Earth worthy of our humandignity. The decisions that have been made have led us to this crossroads -- a moment ofgreat peril, Mr. President. We have a choice. We can continue down the road that's weakened our credibility anddamaged our strategic interests in the region or we can turn toward the future. The roadwon't be smooth, and I have to say, Mr. President, that there will be risks with any approach.But this approach is our last best hope to end this war so we can begin to bring our troopshome and begin the hard work of securing our country and our world from the threats that weface. The President has said he will continue down the road towards more troops and more of thesame failed policies. The President sought and won authorization from Congress to wage thiswar from the start. But he is now dismissing and ignoring the will of the American people, thatis tired of years of watching the human and financial tolls mount. Mr. President, the news from Iraq is very bad, but it can change if we in this Chamber say""enough."" Let this day be the day that begins the painful and difficult work of moving fromthis crossroad. Let this be the day that we begin pulling towards the future with a responsibleconclusion to this painful chapter in our Nation's history. Mr. President, let this be the daywhen we finally send a message that is so clear and so emphatic that it cannot be ignored. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.",obama
