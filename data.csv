"Thank you very much. Good evening, my fellow Americans. I appreciate so very much the opportunity to speak withyou tonight.Mr. Speaker, Lieutenant Governor, friends, distinguished guests, our country has beenthrough a long and trying period, with the outcome of the presidential election not finalized forlonger than any of us could ever imagine.Vice President Gore and I put our hearts and hopes into our campaigns. We both gave it ourall. We shared similar emotions, so I understand how difficult this moment must be for VicePresident Gore and his family.He has a distinguished record of service to our country as a congressman, a senator and avice president.This evening I received a gracious call from the vice president. We agreed to meet early nextweek in Washington, and we agreed to do our best to heal our country after this hard-foughtcontest. Tonight I want to thank all the thousands of volunteers and campaign workers who worked sohard on my behalf.I also salute the vice president and his supports for waging a spirited campaign. And I thankhim for a call that I know was difficult to make. Laura and I wish the vice president andSenator Lieberman and their families the very best.I have a lot to be thankful for tonight. I'm thankful for America and thankful that we were ableto resolve our electoral differences in a peaceful way.I'm thankful to the American people for the great privilege of being able to serve as your nextpresident.I want to thank my wife and our daughters for their love. Laura's active involvement as firstlady has made Texas a better place, and she will be a wonderful first lady of America.I am proud to have Dick Cheney by my side, and America will be proud to have him as ournext vice president.Tonight, I chose to speak from the chamber of the Texas House of Representatives because ithas been a home to bipartisan cooperation. Here in a place where Democrats have themajority, Republicans and Democrats have worked together to do what is right for the peoplewe represent.We've had spirited disagreements. And in the end, we found constructive consensus. It is anexperience I will always carry with me, an example I will always follow.I want to thank my friend, House Speaker Pete Laney, a Democrat, who introduced me today.I want to thank the legislators from both political parties with whom I've worked. Across the hall in our Texas capitol is the state Senate. And I cannot help but think of ourmutual friend, the former Democrat lieutenant governor, Bob Bullock. His love for Texas andhis ability to work in a bipartisan way continue to be a model for all of us.The spirit of cooperation I have seen in this hall is what is needed in Washington, D.C. It isthe challenge of our moment. After a difficult election, we must put politics behind us andwork together to make the promise of America available for every one of our citizens.I'm optimistic that we can change the tone in Washington, D.C.I believe things happen for a reason, and I hope the long wait of the last five weeks willheighten a desire to move beyond the bitterness and partisanship of the recent past.Our nation must rise above a house divided. Americans share hopes and goals and values farmore important than any political disagreements. Republicans want the best for our nation, and so do Democrats. Our votes may differ, but notour hopes.I know America wants reconciliation and unity. I know Americans want progress. And we mustseize this moment and deliver.Together, guided by a spirit of common sense, common courtesy and common goals, we canunite and inspire the American citizens.Together, we will work to make all our public schools excellent, teaching every student ofevery background and every accent, so that no child is left behind.Together, we will save Social Security and renew its promise of a secure retirement forgenerations to come.Together, we will strengthen Medicare and offer prescription drug coverage to all of ourseniors.Together, we will give Americans the broad, fair, and fiscally responsible tax relief theydeserve.Together, we'll have a bipartisan foreign policy true to our values and true to our friends, andwe will have a military equal to every challenge and superior to every adversary.Together, we will address some of society's deepest problems one person at a time, byencouraging and empowering the good hearts and good works of the American people.This is the essence of compassionate conservatism and it will be a foundation of myadministration.These priorities are not merely Republican concerns or Democratic concerns; they areAmerican responsibilities.During the fall campaign, we differed about the details of these proposals, but there wasremarkable consensus about the important issues before us: excellent schools, retirement andhealth security, tax relief, a strong military, a more civil society.We have discussed our differences. Now it is time to find common ground and build consensusto make America a beacon of opportunity in the 21st century.I'm optimistic this can happen. Our future demands it and our history proves it. Two hundredyears ago, in the election of 1800, America faced another close presidential election. A tie inthe Electoral College put the outcome into the hands of Congress. After six days of voting and 36 ballots, the House of Representatives elected Thomas Jeffersonthe third president of the United States. That election brought the first transfer of power fromone party to another in our new democracy.Shortly after the election, Jefferson, in a letter titled ""Reconciliation and Reform,"" wrote this:""The steady character of our countrymen is a rock to which we may safely moor; unequivocalin principle, reasonable in manner. We should be able to hope to do a great deal of good tothe cause of freedom and harmony.""Two hundred years have only strengthened the steady character of America. And so as webegin the work of healing our nation, tonight I call upon that character: respect for eachother, respect for our differences, generosity of spirit, and a willingness to work hard andwork together to solve any problem.I have something else to ask you, to ask every American. I ask for you to pray for this greatnation. I ask for your prayers for leaders from both parties. I thank you for your prayers forme and my family, and I ask you to pray for Vice President Gore and his family.I have faith that with God's help we as a nation will move forward together as one nation,indivisible. And together we will create an America that is open, so every citizen has access tothe American dream; an America that is educated, so every child has the keys to realize thatdream; and an America that is united in our diversity and our shared American values that arelarger than race or party.I was not elected to serve one party, but to serve one nation.The president of the United States is the president of every single American, of every race andevery background.Whether you voted for me or not, I will do my best to serve your interests and I will work toearn your respect.I will be guided by President Jefferson's sense of purpose, to stand for principle, to bereasonable in manner, and above all, to do great good for the cause of freedom and harmony.The presidency is more than an honor. It is more than an office. It is a charge to keep, and Iwill give it my all.Thank you very much and God bless America.",bush
"Good  evening.   Today,  our  fellow  citizens,  our  way  of  life,  our  very  freedom  came  under  attack  in  a  series  of   deliberate  and  deadly  terrorist  acts.  The  victims  were  in  airplanes  or  in  their  offices:   secretaries,  business  men  and  women,  military  and  federal  workers,  moms  and  dads,  friends   and  neighbors.  Thousands  of  lives  were  suddenly  ended  by  evil,  despicable  acts  of  terror.  The   pictures  of  airplanes  flying  into  buildings,  fires  burning,  huge        huge  structures  collapsing   have  filled  us  with  disbelief,  terrible  sadness,  and  a  quiet,  unyielding  anger.  These  acts  of   mass  murder  were  intended  to  frighten  our  nation  into  chaos  and  retreat.  But  they  have   failed.  Our  country  is  strong.   A  great  people  has  been  moved  to  defend  a  great  nation.  Terrorist  attacks  can  shake  the   foundations  of  our  biggest  buildings,  but  they  cannot  touch  the  foundation  of  America.  These   acts  shatter  steel,  but  they  cannot  dent  the  steel  of  American  resolve.  America  was  targeted   for  attack  because  we're  the  brightest  beacon  for  freedom  and  opportunity  in  the  world.  And   no  one  will  keep  that  light  from  shining.  Today,  our  nation  saw  evil        the  very  worst  of  human   nature        and  we  responded  with  the  best  of  America.  With  the  daring  of  our  rescue  workers,   with  the  caring  for  strangers  and  neighbors  who  came  to  give  blood  and  help  in  any  way  they   could.   Immediately  following  the  first  attack,  I  implemented  our  government's  emergency  response   plans.  Our  military  is  powerful,  and  it's  prepared.  Our  emergency  teams  are  working  in  New   York  City  and  Washington  D.C.  to  help  with  local  rescue  efforts.  Our  first  priority  is  to  get  help   to  those  who  have  been  injured,  and  to  take  every  precaution  to  protect  our  citizens  at  home   and  around  the  world  from  further  attacks.  The  functions  of  our  government  continue  without   interruption.  Federal  agencies  in  Washington  which  had  to  be  evacuated  today  are  reopening   for  essential  personnel  tonight  and  will  be  open  for  business  tomorrow.  Our  financial   institutions  remain  strong,  and  the  American  economy  will  be  open  for  business  as  well.    The  search  is  underway  for  those  who  were  behind  these  evil  acts.  I  have  directed  the  full   resources  of  our  intelligence  and  law  enforcement  communities  to  find  those  responsible  and   to  bring  them  to  justice.  We  will  make  no  distinction  between  the  terrorists  who  committed   these  acts  and  those  who  harbor  them.   I  appreciate  so  very  much  the  members  of  Congress  who  have  joined  me  in  strongly   condemning  these  attacks.  And  on  behalf  of  the  American  people,  I  thank  the  many  world   leaders  who  have  called  to  offer  their  condolences  and  assistance.  America  and  our  friends   and  allies  join  with  all  those  who  want  peace  and  security  in  the  world,  and  we  stand  together   to  win  the  war  against  terrorism.   Tonight,  I  ask  for  your  prayers  for  all  those  who  grieve,  for  the  children  whose  worlds  have   been  shattered,  for  all  whose  sense  of  safety  and  security  has  been  threatened.  And  I  pray   they  will  be  comforted  by  a  Power  greater  than  any  of  us,  spoken  through  the  ages  in  Psalm   23:   Even  though  I  walk  through  the  valley  of  the  shadow  of  death,  I  fear  no  evil  for  you  are  with   me.   This  is  a  day  when  all  Americans  from  every  walk  of  life  unite  in  our  resolve  for  justice  and   peace.  America  has  stood  down  enemies  before,  and  we  will  do  so  this  time.  None  of  us  will   ever  forget  this  day,  yet  we  go  forward  to  defend  freedom  and  all  that  is  good  and  just  in  our   world.   Thank  you.  Good  night.  And  God  bless  America.",bush
"President Bush: Thank you all. I want you all to know -- it [bullhorn] can't go any louder -- I want you all to know that American today, American today is on bended knee, in prayer for the people whose lives were lost here, for the workers who work here, for the families who mourn. The nation stands with the good people of New York City and New Jersey and Connecticut as we mourn the loss of thousands of our citizens Rescue Worker: I can't hear you! President Bush: I can hear you! I can hear you! The rest of the world hears you! And the people -- and the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon! Rescue Workers: [Chanting] U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! President Bush: The nation -- The nation sends its love and compassion -- Rescue Worker: God bless America! President Bush: -- to everybody who is here. Thank you for your hard work. Thank you for makin' the nation proud, and may God bless America. Rescue Workers: [Chanting] U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!",bush
"We are here in the middle hour of our grief. So many have suffered so great a loss, and today we express our nation's sorrow. We come before God to pray for the missing and the dead, and for those who loved them. On Tuesday, our country was attacked with deliberate andmassive cruelty. We have seen the images of fire and ashes and bent steel. Now come the names, the list of casualties we are only beginning to read: They are the names of men and women who began their day at a desk or in an airport,busy with life. They are the names of people who faced death and in their last moments called hometo say, be brave and I love you. They are the names of passengers who defied their murderers and prevented themurder of others on the ground. They are the names of men and women who wore the uniform of the United States anddied at their posts. They are the names of rescuers -- the ones whom death found running up the stairsand into the fires to help others. We will read all these names. We will linger over them and learn their stories, and manyAmericans will weep. To the children and parents and spouses and families and friends of the lost, we offer the deepest sympathy of the nation. And I assure you, you are not alone. Just three days removed from these events, Americans do not yet have the distance of history, but ourresponsibility to history is already clear: to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil. War has been waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder. This nation is peaceful, but fierce when stirred to anger. This conflict was begun on the timing and terms of others; it will end in a way and at an hour of our choosing. Our purpose as a nation is firm, yet our wounds as a people are recent and unhealed and lead us to pray. In many of our prayers this week, there's a searching and an honesty. At St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York, on Tuesday, awoman said, ""I pray to God to give us a sign that He's still here."" Others have prayed for the same, searching hospital to hospital, carrying pictures of those still missing. God's signs are not always the ones we look for. We learn in tragedy that His purposes are not always our own, yet the prayers of private suffering, whether in our homes or in this great cathedral are known and heard and understood. There are prayers that help us last through the day or endure the night. There are prayers of friends and strangers that give us strength for the journey, and there are prayers that yield our will to a Will greater than ourown. This world He created is of moral design. Grief and tragedy and hatred are only for a time. Goodness, remembrance and love have no end, and the Lord of life holds all who die and allwho mourn. It is said that adversity introduces us to ourselves. This is true of a nation as well. In this trial, we have been reminded and the world has seen that our fellow Americans are generous andkind, resourceful and brave. We see our national character in rescuers working past exhaustion, in long lines of blooddonors, in thousands of citizens who have asked to work and serve in any way possible. And we have seen our national character in eloquent acts of sacrifice: Inside the World Trade Center, one man who could have saved himself stayed until theend and at the side of his quadriplegic friend. A beloved priest died giving the last rites to a firefighter. Two office workers, finding a disabled stranger, carried her down 68 floors to safety. A group of men drove through the night from Dallas to Washington to bring skin graftsfor burned victims. In these acts and many others, Americans showed a deep commitment to one another and anabiding love for our country. Today, we feel what Franklin Roosevelt called, ""the warm courage of national unity."" This is a unity of every faith and every background. It has joined together political parties and both houses of Congress. It is evident in services of prayer and candlelight vigils and American flags, which are displayed in pride and waved in defiance. Our unity is a kinship of grief and a steadfast resolve to prevail against our enemies. And this unity against terror is nowextending across the world. America is a nation full of good fortune, with so much to be grateful for, but we are not spared from suffering. In every generation, the world has produced enemies of human freedom. They have attacked America because we are freedom's home and defender, and the commitment ofour Fathers is now the calling of our time. On this national day of prayer and remembrance, we ask Almighty God to watch over our nation and grant us patience and resolve in all that is to come. We pray that He will comfort and console those who now walk in sorrow. We thank Him for each life we now must mourn,and the promise of a life to come. As we've been assured, neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities, nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth can separate us from God's love. May He bless the souls of the departed. May He comfort our own. And may He always guide our country. God bless America.",bush
"Good morning. This weekend I am engaged in extensive sessions with members of my National Security Council, as we plan a comprehensive assault on terrorism. This will be adifferent kind of conflict against a different kind of enemy. This is a conflict without battlefields or beachheads, a conflict with opponents who believe they are invisible. Yet, they are mistaken. They will be exposed, and they will discover what others in the past have learned: Those who make war against the United States have chosen their own destruction. Victory against terrorism will not take place in a single battle, but in a series of decisive actions against terrorist organizations and those who harbor and supportthem. We are planning a broad and sustained campaign to secure our country and eradicate the evil of terrorism. And we are determined to see this conflict through. Americans of every faith andbackground are committed to this goal. Yesterday I visited the site of the destruction in New York City and saw an amazing spirit of sacrifice and patriotism and defiance. I met with rescuers who have worked past exhaustion,who cheered for our country and the great cause we have entered. In Washington, D.C., the political parties and both Houses of Congress have shown a remarkable unity, and I'm deeply grateful. A terrorist attack designed to tear us apart has instead bound us together as a nation. Over the past few days, we have learned much about American courage -- the courage of firefighters and police officers who suffered so great a loss, the courage of passengers aboard United 93 who may well have fought with thehijackers and saved many lives on the ground. Now we honor those who died, and prepare to respond to these attacks on our nation. I will not settle for a token act. Our response must be sweeping, sustained, and effective. We havemuch do to, and much to ask of the American people. You will be asked for your patience -- for the conflict will not be short. You will be asked for resolve -- for the conflict will not be easy. You will be asked for your strength, because thecourse to victory may be long. In the past week, we have seen the American people at their very best everywhere in America. Citizens have come together to pray, to give blood, to fly our country'sflag. Americans are coming together to share their grief and gain strength from one another. Great tragedy has come to us, and we are meeting it with the best that is in our country, with courage and concern for others: because this is America. This is who we are. This is what ourenemies hate and have attacked. And this is why we will prevail. Thank you for listening.",bush
"Thank  you  all  very  much  for  your  hospitality.  We've  just  had  wide  ranging  discussions  on  the   matter  at  hand.  Like  the  good  folks  standing  with  me,  the  American  people  were  appalled  and   outraged  at  last  Tuesday's  attacks.  And  so  were  Muslims  all  across  the  world.  Both  Americans   and  Muslim  friends  and  citizens,  tax  paying  citizens,  and  Muslims  in  nations  were  just  appalled   and  could  not  believe  what  we  saw  on  our  TV  screens.   These  acts  of  violence  against  innocents  violate  the  fundamental  tenets  of  the  Islamic  faith.   And  it's  important  for  my  fellow  Americans  to  understand  that.  The  English  translation  is  not   as  eloquent  as  the  original  Arabic,  but  let  me  quote  from  the  Koran,  itself:  In  the  long  run,  evil   in  the  extreme  will  be  the  end  of  those  who  do  evil.  For  that  they  rejected  the  signs  of  Allah   and  held  them  up  to  ridicule.  1   The  face  of  terror  is  not  the  true  faith  of  Islam.  That's  not  what  Islam  is  all  about.  Islam  is   peace.  These  terrorists  don't  represent  peace.  They  represent  evil  and  war.  When  we  think  of   Islam  we  think  of  a  faith  that  brings  comfort  to  a  billion  people  around  the  world.  Billions  of   people  find  comfort  and  solace  and  peace.  And  that's  made  brothers  and  sisters  out  of  every   race,  out  of  every  race.  America  counts  millions  of  Muslims  amongst  our  citizens,  and  Muslims   make  an  incredibly  valuable  contribution  to  our  country.  Muslims  are  doctors,  lawyers,  law   professors,  members  of  the  military,  entrepreneurs,  shopkeepers,  moms  and  dads.  And  they   need  to  be  treated  with  respect.  In  our  anger  and  emotion,  our  fellow  Americans  must  treat   each  other  with  respect.    Women  who  cover  their  heads  in  this  country  must  feel  comfortable  going  outside  their   homes.  Moms  who  wear  cover  must  be  not  intimidated  in  America.  That's  not  the  America  I   know.  That's  not  the  America  I  value.  I've  been  told  that  some  fear  to  leave    some  don't  want   to  go  shopping  for  their  families    some  don't  want  to  go  about  their  ordinary  daily  routines   because,  by  wearing  cover,  they're  afraid  they'll  be  intimidated.  That  should  not  and  that  will   not  stand  in  America.  Those  who  feel  like  they  can  intimidate  our  fellow  citizens  to  take  out   their  anger  don't  represent  the  best  of  America,  they  represent  the  worst  of  humankind,  and   they  should  be  ashamed  of  that  kind  of  behavior.   Now  this  is  a  great  country.  It's  a  great  country  because  we  share  the  same  values  of  respect   and  dignity  and  human  worth.  And  it  is  my  honor  to  be  meeting  with  leaders  who  feel  just  the   same  way  I  do.  They're  outraged.  They're  sad.  They  love  America  just  as  much  as  I  do.   And  I  want  to  thank  you  all  for  giving  me  a  chance  to  come  by.   And  may  God  bless  us  all.   Thank  you.   1  Holy  Qur'an  [30:10]:  ""Have  they  not  travelled  in  the  earth  so  that  they  might  see  how  evil  was  the  end  of  those  who  were  before  them?  They   were  stronger  than  these  in  power,  and  they  tilled  the  soil  and  populated  it  more  and  better  than  these  have  populated  it.  And  their  Messengers   came  to  them  with  manifest  Signs.  And  Allah  would  not  wrong  them,  but  they  wronged  their  own  souls.""

"Mr.  Speaker,  Mr.  President  Pro  Tempore,  members  of  Congress,  and  fellow  Americans:   In  the  normal  course  of  events,  Presidents  come  to  this  chamber  to  report  on  the  state  of  the   Union.  Tonight,  no  such  report  is  needed.  It  has  already  been  delivered  by  the  American   people.   We  have  seen  it  in  the  courage  of  passengers,  who  rushed  terrorists  to  save  others  on  the   ground        passengers  like  an  exceptional  man  named  Todd  Beamer.  And  would  you  please   help  me  to  welcome  his  wife,  Lisa  Beamer,  here  tonight.  We  have  seen  the  state  of  our  Union   in  the  endurance  of  rescuers,  working  past  exhaustion.  We've  seen  the  unfurling  of  flags,  the   lighting  of  candles,  the  giving  of  blood,  the  saying  of  prayers        in  English,  Hebrew,  and   Arabic.  We  have  seen  the  decency  of  a  loving  and  giving  people  who  have  made  the  grief  of   strangers  their  own.  My  fellow  citizens,  for  the  last  nine  days,  the  entire  world  has  seen  for   itself  the  state  of  our  Union        and  it  is  strong.   Tonight  we  are  a  country  awakened  to  danger  and  called  to  defend  freedom.  Our  grief  has   turned  to  anger,  and  anger  to  resolution.  Whether  we  bring  our  enemies  to  justice,  or  bring   justice  to  our  enemies,  justice  will  be  done.  I  thank  the  Congress  for  its  leadership  at  such  an   important  time.  All  of  America  was  touched  on  the  evening  of  the  tragedy  to  see  Republicans   and  Democrats  joined  together  on  the  steps  of  this  Capitol,  singing  ""God  Bless  America.""  And   you  did  more  than  sing    you  acted,  by  delivering  40  billion  dollars  to  rebuild  our  communities   and  meet  the  needs  of  our  military.  Speaker  Hastert,  Minority  Leader  Gephardt,  Majority   Leader  Daschle,  and  Senator  Lott,  I  thank  you  for  your  friendship,  for  your  leadership,  and  for   your  service  to  our  country.  And  on  behalf  of  the  American  people,  I  thank  the  world  for  its   outpouring  of  support.  America  will  never  forget  the  sounds  of  our  National  Anthem  playing  at   Buckingham  Palace,  on  the  streets  of  Paris,  and  at  Berlin's  Brandenburg  Gate.    We  will  not  forget  South  Korean  children  gathering  to  pray  outside  our  embassy  in  Seoul,  or   the  prayers  of  sympathy  offered  at  a  mosque  in  Cairo.  We  will  not  forget  moments  of  silence   and  days  of  mourning  in  Australia  and  Africa  and  Latin  America.  Nor  will  we  forget  the  citizens   of  80  other  nations  who  died  with  our  own:  dozens  of  Pakistanis    more  than  130  Israelis     more  than  250  citizens  of  India    men  and  women  from  El  Salvador,  Iran,  Mexico,  and  Japan     and  hundreds  of  British  citizens.  America  has  no  truer  friend  than  Great  Britain.  Once  again,   we  are  joined  together  in  a  great  cause        so  honored  the  British  Prime  Minister  has  crossed   an  ocean  to  show  his  unity  with  America.  Thank  you  for  coming,  friend.   On  September  the  11th,  enemies  of  freedom  committed  an  act  of  war  against  our   country.  Americans  have  known  wars        but  for  the  past  136  years,  they  have  been  wars  on   foreign  soil,  except  for  one  Sunday  in  1941.  Americans  have  known  the  casualties  of  war         but  not  at  the  center  of  a  great  city  on  a  peaceful  morning.  Americans  have  known  surprise   attacks        but  never  before  on  thousands  of  civilians.  All  of  this  was  brought  upon  us  in  a   single  day        and  night  fell  on  a  different  world,  a  world  where  freedom  itself  is  under  attack.   Americans  have  many  questions  tonight.  Americans  are  asking:  Who  attacked  our  country?   The  evidence  we  have  gathered  all  points  to  a  collection  of  loosely  affiliated  terrorist   organizations  known  as  al  Qaeda.  They  are  some  of  the  murderers  indicted  for  bombing   American  embassies  in  Tanzania  and  Kenya,  and  responsible  for  bombing  the  USS  Cole.  Al   Qaeda  is  to  terror  what  the  mafia  is  to  crime.  But  its  goal  is  not  making  money    its  goal  is   remaking  the  world        and  imposing  its  radical  beliefs  on  people  everywhere.   The  terrorists  practice  a  fringe  form  of  Islamic  extremism  that  has  been  rejected  by  Muslim   scholars  and  the  vast  majority  of  Muslim  clerics,  a  fringe  movement  that  perverts  the  peaceful   teachings  of  Islam.  The  terrorists'  directive  commands  them  to  kill  Christians  and  Jews,  to  kill   all  Americans,  and  make  no  distinctions  among  military  and  civilians,  including  women  and   children.  This  group  and  its  leader        a  person  named  Usama  bin  Laden        are  linked  to  many   other  organizations  in  different  countries,  including  the  Egyptian  Islamic  Jihad  and  the  Islamic   Movement  of  Uzbekistan.  There  are  thousands  of  these  terrorists  in  more  than  60  countries.   They  are  recruited  from  their  own  nations  and  neighborhoods  and  brought  to  camps  in  places   like  Afghanistan,  where  they  are  trained  in  the  tactics  of  terror.  They  are  sent  back  to  their   homes  or  sent  to  hide  in  countries  around  the  world  to  plot  evil  and  destruction.   The  leadership  of  al  Qaeda  has  great  influence  in  Afghanistan  and  supports  the  Taliban  regime   in  controlling  most  of  that  country.  In  Afghanistan,  we  see  al  Qaeda's  vision  for  the  world.   Afghanistan's  people  have  been  brutalized    many  are  starving  and  many  have  fled.  Women   are  not  allowed  to  attend  school.  You  can  be  jailed  for  owning  a  television.  Religion  can  be   practiced  only  as  their  leaders  dictate.  A  man  can  be  jailed  in  Afghanistan  if  his  beard  is  not   long  enough.   The  United  States  respects  the  people  of  Afghanistan.  After  all,  we  are  currently  its  largest   source  of  humanitarian  aid    but  we  condemn  the  Taliban  regime.  It  is  not  only  repressing  its   own  people,  it  is  threatening  people  everywhere  by  sponsoring  and  sheltering  and  supplying   terrorists.  By  aiding  and  abetting  murder,  the  Taliban  regime  is  committing  murder.    And  tonight,  the  United  States  of  America  makes  the  following  demands  on  the   Taliban:  Deliver  to  United  States  authorities  all  the  leaders  of  al  Qaeda  who  hide  in  your   land.  Release  all  foreign  nationals,  including  American  citizens,  you  have  unjustly   imprisoned.  Protect  foreign  journalists,  diplomats,  and  aid  workers  in  your  country.  Close   immediately  and  permanently  every  terrorist  training  camp  in  Afghanistan,  and  hand  over   every  terrorist,  and  every  person  in  their  support  structure,  to  appropriate  authorities.  Give   the  United  States  full  access  to  terrorist  training  camps,  so  we  can  make  sure  they  are  no   longer  operating.  These  demands  are  not  open  to  negotiation  or  discussion.  The  Taliban  must   act,  and  act  immediately.  They  will  hand  over  the  terrorists,  or  they  will  share  in  their  fate.   I  also  want  to  speak  tonight  directly  to  Muslims  throughout  the  world.  We  respect  your   faith.  It's  practiced  freely  by  many  millions  of  Americans,  and  by  millions  more  in  countries   that  America  counts  as  friends.  Its  teachings  are  good  and  peaceful,  and  those  who  commit   evil  in  the  name  of  Allah  blaspheme  the  name  of  Allah.  The  terrorists  are  traitors  to  their  own   faith,  trying,  in  effect,  to  hijack  Islam  itself.  The  enemy  of  America  is  not  our  many  Muslim   friends    it  is  not  our  many  Arab  friends.  Our  enemy  is  a  radical  network  of  terrorists,  and   every  government  that  supports  them.  Our  war  on  terror  begins  with  al  Qaeda,  but  it  does  not   end  there.  It  will  not  end  until  every  terrorist  group  of  global  reach  has  been  found,  stopped,   and  defeated.   Americans  are  asking,  why  do  they  hate  us?  They  hate  what  they  see  right  here  in  this   chamber        a  democratically  elected  government.  Their  leaders  are  self  appointed.  They  hate   our  freedoms        our  freedom  of  religion,  our  freedom  of  speech,  our  freedom  to  vote  and   assemble  and  disagree  with  each  other.  They  want  to  overthrow  existing  governments  in   many  Muslim  countries,  such  as  Egypt,  Saudi  Arabia,  and  Jordan.  They  want  to  drive  Israel   out  of  the  Middle  East.  They  want  to  drive  Christians  and  Jews  out  of  vast  regions  of  Asia  and   Africa.  These  terrorists  kill  not  merely  to  end  lives,  but  to  disrupt  and  end  a  way  of  life.  With   every  atrocity,  they  hope  that  America  grows  fearful,  retreating  from  the  world  and  forsaking   our  friends.  They  stand  against  us,  because  we  stand  in  their  way.   We  are  not  deceived  by  their  pretenses  to  piety.  We  have  seen  their  kind  before.  They  are  the   heirs  of  all  the  murderous  ideologies  of  the  20th  century.  By  sacrificing  human  life  to  serve   their  radical  visions        by  abandoning  every  value  except  the  will  to  power        they  follow  in  the   path  of  fascism,  Nazism,  and  totalitarianism.  And  they  will  follow  that  path  all  the  way,  to   where  it  ends:  in  history's  unmarked  grave  of  discarded  lies.  Americans  are  asking:  How  will   we  fight  and  win  this  war?  We  will  direct  every  resource  at  our  command        every  means  of   diplomacy,  every  tool  of  intelligence,  every  instrument  of  law  enforcement,  every  financial   influence,  and  every  necessary  weapon  of  war        to  the  disruption  and  to  the  defeat  of  the   global  terror  network.   Now  this  war  will  not  be  like  the  war  against  Iraq  a  decade  ago,  with  a  decisive  liberation  of   territory  and  a  swift  conclusion.  It  will  not  look  like  the  air  war  above  Kosovo  two  years  ago,   where  no  ground  troops  were  used  and  not  a  single  American  was  lost  in  combat.  Our   response  involves  far  more  than  instant  retaliation  and  isolated  strikes.  Americans  should  not   expect  one  battle,  but  a  lengthy  campaign,  unlike  any  other  we  have  ever  seen.  It  may   include  dramatic  strikes,  visible  on  TV,  and  covert  operations,  secret  even  in  success.    We  will  starve  terrorists  of  funding,  turn  them  one  against  another,  drive  them  from  place  to   place,  until  there  is  no  refuge  or  no  rest.  And  we  will  pursue  nations  that  provide  aid  or  safe   haven  to  terrorism.  Every  nation,  in  every  region,  now  has  a  decision  to  make.  Either  you  are   with  us,  or  you  are  with  the  terrorists.  From  this  day  forward,  any  nation  that  continues  to   harbor  or  support  terrorism  will  be  regarded  by  the  United  States  as  a  hostile  regime.   Our  nation  has  been  put  on  notice:  We're  not  immune  from  attack.  We  will  take  defensive   measures  against  terrorism  to  protect  Americans.  Today,  dozens  of  federal  departments  and   agencies,  as  well  as  state  and  local  governments,  have  responsibilities  affecting  homeland   security.  These  efforts  must  be  coordinated  at  the  highest  level.  So  tonight  I  announce  the   creation  of  a  Cabinet  level  position  reporting  directly  to  me        the  Office  of  Homeland  Security.   And  tonight  I  also  announce  a  distinguished  American  to  lead  this  effort,  to  strengthen   American  security:  a  military  veteran,  an  effective  governor,  a  true  patriot,  a  trusted  friend         Pennsylvania's  Tom  Ridge.  He  will  lead,  oversee,  and  coordinate  a  comprehensive  national   strategy  to  safeguard  our  country  against  terrorism,  and  respond  to  any  attacks  that  may   come.   These  measures  are  essential.  But  the  only  way  to  defeat  terrorism  as  a  threat  to  our  way  of   life  is  to  stop  it,  eliminate  it,  and  destroy  it  where  it  grows.  Many  will  be  involved  in  this  effort,   from  FBI  agents  to  intelligence  operatives  to  the  reservists  we  have  called  to  active  duty.  All   deserve  our  thanks,  and  all  have  our  prayers.  And  tonight,  a  few  miles  from  the  damaged   Pentagon,  I  have  a  message  for  our  military:  Be  ready.  I've  called  the  Armed  Forces  to  alert,   and  there  is  a  reason.  The  hour  is  coming  when  America  will  act,  and  you  will  make  us   proud.  This  is  not,  however,  just  America's  fight.  And  what  is  at  stake  is  not  just  America's   freedom.  This  is  the  world's  fight.  This  is  civilization's  fight.  This  is  the  fight  of  all  who  believe   in  progress  and  pluralism,  tolerance  and  freedom.   We  ask  every  nation  to  join  us.  We  will  ask,  and  we  will  need,  the  help  of  police  forces,   intelligence  services,  and  banking  systems  around  the  world.  The  United  States  is  grateful   that  many  nations  and  many  international  organizations  have  already  responded        with   sympathy  and  with  support.  Nations  from  Latin  America,  to  Asia,  to  Africa,  to  Europe,  to  the   Islamic  world.  Perhaps  the  NATO  Charter  reflects  best  the  attitude  of  the  world:  An  attack  on   one  is  an  attack  on  all.  The  civilized  world  is  rallying  to  America's  side.  They  understand  that  if   this  terror  goes  unpunished,  their  own  cities,  their  own  citizens  may  be  next.  Terror,   unanswered,  can  not  only  bring  down  buildings,  it  can  threaten  the  stability  of  legitimate   governments.  And  you  know  what?  We're  not  going  to  allow  it.   Americans  are  asking:  What  is  expected  of  us?  I  ask  you  to  live  your  lives,  and  hug  your   children.  I  know  many  citizens  have  fears  tonight,  and  I  ask  you  to  be  calm  and  resolute,  even   in  the  face  of  a  continuing  threat.  I  ask  you  to  uphold  the  values  of  America,  and  remember   why  so  many  have  come  here.  We  are  in  a  fight  for  our  principles,  and  our  first  responsibility   is  to  live  by  them.  No  one  should  be  singled  out  for  unfair  treatment  or  unkind  words  because   of  their  ethnic  background  or  religious  faith.  I  ask  you  to  continue  to  support  the  victims  of   this  tragedy  with  your  contributions.  Those  who  want  to  give  can  go  to  a  central  source  of   information,  libertyunites.org,  to  find  the  names  of  groups  providing  direct  help  in  New  York,   Pennsylvania,  and  Virginia.    The  thousands  of  FBI  agents  who  are  now  at  work  in  this  investigation  may  need  your   cooperation,  and  I  ask  you  to  give  it.  I  ask  for  your  patience,  with  the  delays  and   inconveniences  that  may  accompany  tighter  security    and  for  your  patience  in  what  will  be  a   long  struggle.  I  ask  your  continued  participation  and  confidence  in  the  American   economy.  Terrorists  attacked  a  symbol  of  American  prosperity.  They  did  not  touch  its   source.  America  is  successful  because  of  the  hard  work,  and  creativity,  and  enterprise  of  our   people.  These  were  the  true  strengths  of  our  economy  before  September  11th,  and  they  are   our  strengths  today.  And,  finally,  please  continue  praying  for  the  victims  of  terror  and  their   families,  for  those  in  uniform,  and  for  our  great  country.  Prayer  has  comforted  us  in  sorrow,   and  will  help  strengthen  us  for  the  journey  ahead.   Tonight  I  thank  my  fellow  Americans  for  what  you  have  already  done  and  for  what  you  will   do.  And  ladies  and  gentlemen  of  the  Congress,  I  thank  you,  their  representatives,  for  what   you  have  already  done  and  for  what  we  will  do  together.  Tonight,  we  face  new  and  sudden   national  challenges.  We  will  come  together  to  improve  air  safety,  to  dramatically  expand  the   number  of  air  marshals  on  domestic  flights,  and  take  new  measures  to  prevent  hijacking.  We   will  come  together  to  promote  stability  and  keep  our  airlines  flying,  with  direct  assistance   during  this  emergency.  We  will  come  together  to  give  law  enforcement  the  additional  tools  it   needs  to  track  down  terror  here  at  home.  We  will  come  together  to  strengthen  our  intelligence   capabilities  to  know  the  plans  of  terrorists  before  they  act,  and  to  find  them  before  they   strike.   We  will  come  together  to  take  active  steps  that  strengthen  America's  economy,  and  put  our   people  back  to  work.  Tonight  we  welcome  two  leaders  who  embody  the  extraordinary  spirit  of   all  New  Yorkers:  Governor  George  Pataki,  and  Mayor  Rudolph  Giuliani.  As  a  symbol  of   America's  resolve,  my  administration  will  work  with  Congress,  and  these  two  leaders,  to  show   the  world  that  we  will  rebuild  New  York  City.   After  all  that  has  just  passed        all  the  lives  taken,  and  all  the  possibilities  and  hopes  that  died   with  them        it  is  natural  to  wonder  if  America's  future  is  one  of  fear.  Some  speak  of  an  age  of   terror.  I  know  there  are  struggles  ahead,  and  dangers  to  face.   But  this  country  will  define  our   times,  not  be  defined  by  them.   As  long  as  the  United  States  of  America  is  determined  and   strong,  this  will  not  be  an  age  of  terror    this  will  be  an  age  of  liberty,  here  and  across  the   world.   Great  harm  has  been  done  to  us.  We  have  suffered  great  loss.  And  in  our  grief  and  anger  we   have  found  our  mission  and  our  moment.  Freedom  and  fear  are  at  war.  The  advance  of   human  freedom        the  great  achievement  of  our  time,  and  the  great  hope  of  every  time         now  depends  on  us.  Our  nation,  this  generation  will  lift  a  dark  threat  of  violence  from  our   people  and  our  future.  We  will  rally  the  world  to  this  cause  by  our  efforts,  by  our  courage.  We   will  not  tire,  we  will  not  falter,  and  we  will  not  fail.   It  is  my  hope  that  in  the  months  and  years  ahead,  life  will  return  almost  to  normal.  We'll  go   back  to  our  lives  and  routines,  and  that  is  good.  Even  grief  recedes  with  time  and  grace.  But   our  resolve  must  not  pass.  Each  of  us  will  remember  what  happened  that  day,  and  to  whom  it   happened.    We'll  remember  the  moment  the  news  came        where  we  were  and  what  we  were  doing.  Some   will  remember  an  image  of  a  fire,  or  a  story  of  rescue.  Some  will  carry  memories  of  a  face  and   a  voice  gone  forever.   And  I  will  carry  this:  It  is  the  police  shield  of  a  man  named  George  Howard,  who  died  at  the   World  Trade  Center  trying  to  save  others.  It  was  given  to  me  by  his  mom,  Arlene,  as  a  proud   memorial  to  her  son.  This  is  my  reminder  of  lives  that  ended,  and  a  task  that  does  not  end.   I   will  not  forget  this  wound  to  our  country  or  those  who  inflicted  it.  I  will  not  yield    I  will  not   rest    I  will  not  relent  in  waging  this  struggle  for  freedom  and  security  for  the  American  people.   The  course  of  this  conflict  is  not  known,  yet  its  outcome  is  certain.  Freedom  and  fear,  justice   and  cruelty,  have  always  been  at  war,  and  we  know  that  God  is  not  neutral  between  them.   Fellow  citizens,  we'll  meet  violence  with  patient  justice        assured  of  the  rightness  of  our   cause,  and  confident  of  the  victories  to  come.  In  all  that  lies  before  us,  may  God  grant  us   wisdom,  and  may  He  watch  over  the  United  States  of  America.  Thank  you.",bush
"Good afternoon. On my orders, the United States military has begun strikes against Al Qaedaterrorist training camps and military installations of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. Thesecarefully targeted actions are designed to disrupt the use of Afghanistan as a terrorist base ofoperations and to attack the military capability of the Taliban regime. We are joined in this operation by our staunch friend, Great Britain. Other close friends,including Canada, Australia, Germany and France, have pledged forces as the operationunfolds. More than 40 countries in the Middle East, Africa, Europe, and across Asia havegranted air transit or landing rights. Many more have shared intelligence. We are supportedby the collective will of the world. More than two weeks ago, I gave Taliban leaders a series of clear and specific demands: Closeterrorist training camps; hand over leaders of the Al Qaeda network; and return all foreignnationals, including American citizens, unjustly detained in your country. None of thesedemands was met. And now, the Taliban will pay a price. By destroying camps and disrupting communications, we will make it more difficult for theterror network to train new recruits and coordinate their evil plans. Initially the terrorists mayburrow deeper into caves and other entrenched hiding places. Our military action is alsodesigned to clear the way for sustained, comprehensive, and relentless operations to drivethem out and bring them to justice. At the same time, the oppressed people of Afghanistan will know the generosity of Americaand our allies. As we strike military targets, we will also drop food, medicine, and supplies tothe starving and suffering men and women and children of Afghanistan. The United States ofAmerica is a friend to the Afghan people, and we are the friends of almost a billion worldwidewho practice the Islamic faith. The United States of America is an enemy of those who aidterrorists and of the barbaric criminals who profane a great religion by committing murder inits name. This military action is a part of our campaign against terrorism, another front in awar that has already been joined through diplomacy, intelligence, the freezing of financialassets, and the arrests of known terrorists by law-enforcement agents in 38 countries. Given the nature and reach of our enemies, we will win this conflict by the patientaccumulation of successes, by meeting a series of challenges with determination, and will, andpurpose. Today we focus on Afghanistan, but the battle is broader. Every nation has a choiceto make. In this conflict, there is no neutral ground. If any government sponsors the outlawsand killers of innocence, they have become outlaws and murderers themselves. And they willtake that lonely path at their own peril. I'm speaking to you today from the Treaty Room of the White House, a place where Americanpresidents have worked for peace. We're a peaceful nation. Yet, as we have learned, sosuddenly and so tragically, there can be no peace in a world of sudden terror. In the face oftoday's new threat, the only way to pursue peace is to pursue those who threaten it. We didnot ask for this mission, but we will fulfill it. The name of today's military operation is Enduring Freedom. We defend not only our preciousfreedoms, but also the freedom of people everywhere to live and raise their children free fromfear. I know many Americans feel fear today. And our government is taking strong precautions. Alllaw enforcement and intelligence agencies are working aggressively around America, aroundthe world -- and around the clock. At my request, many governors have activated the NationalGuard to strengthen airport security. We have called up reserves to reinforce our militarycapability and strengthen the protection of our homeland. In the months ahead, our patience will be one of our strengths -- patience with the long waitsthat will result from tighter security, patience and understanding that it will take time toachieve our goals, patience in all the sacrifices that may come. Today, those sacrifices arebeing made by members of our armed forces who now defend us so far from home, and bytheir proud and worried families. A Commander-in-Chief sends America's sons and daughters into battle in a foreign land onlyafter the greatest care and a lot of prayer. We ask a lot of those who wear our uniform. Weask them to leave their loved ones, to travel great distances, to risk injury, even to beprepared to make the ultimate sacrifice of their lives. They are dedicated. They are honorable.They represent the best of our country, and we are grateful. To all the men and women in our military -- every sailor, every soldier, every airman, everyCoast Guardsman, every Marine -- I say this: Your mission is defined; your objectives areclear; your goal is just. You have my full confidence, and you will have every tool you need tocarry out your duty. I recently received a touching letter that says a lot about the state of America in these difficulttimes, a letter from a fourth-grade girl with a father in the military: ""As much as I don't wantmy dad to fight,"" she wrote, ""I'm willing to give him to you."" This is a precious gift. Thegreatest she could give. This young girl knows what America is all about. Since September 11,an entire generation of young Americans has gained new understanding of the value offreedom and its cost and duty and its sacrifice. The battle is now joined on many fronts. We will not waiver, we will not tire, we will not falter,and we will not fail. Peace and freedom will prevail. Thank you. May God continue to bless America.",bush
"Please be seated. President and Senator Clinton, thank you all for being here. We have come here to pay our respects to 125 men and women who died in the service of America. We also remember 64 passengers on a hijacked plane; those men and women, boys and girls who fellinto the hands of evildoers, and also died here exactly one month ago. On September 11th, great sorrow came to our country. And from that sorrow has come great resolve. Today, we are a nation awakened to the evil of terrorism, and determined to destroy it. That work began the moment we were attacked; and it will continue until justice isdelivered. Americans are returning, as we must, to the normal pursuits of life. Americans are returning, as we must, to the normal pursuits of life. But we know that if you lost a son or daughter here, or a husband, or a wife, or a mom or dad, life will never again be as it was. The losswas sudden, and hard, and permanent. So difficult to explain. So difficult to accept. Three schoolchildren traveling with their teacher. An Army general. A budget analyst who reported to work here for 30 years. A lieutenant commander in the Naval Reserve who leftbehind a wife, a four-year-old son, and another child on the way. One life touches so many others. One death can leave sorrow that seems almost unbearable. But to all of you who lost someone here, I want to say: You are not alone. The American people will never forget the cruelty that was done here and in New York, and in thesky over Pennsylvania. We will never forget all the innocent people killed by the hatred of a few. We know the loneliness you feel in your loss. The entire nation, the entire nation shares in yoursadness. And we pray for you and your loved ones. And we will always honor their memory. The hijackers were instruments of evil who died in vain. Behind them is a cult of evil which seeks to harm the innocent and thrives on human suffering. Theirs is the worst kind of cruelty, the cruelty that is fed, not weakened, by tears. Theirs is the worst kind of violence, pure malice, while daring to claim the authority of God. We cannot fully understand the designs and power of evil. It is enough to know that evil, like goodness, exists. And in theterrorists, evil has found a willing servant. In New York, the terrorists chose as their target a symbol of America's freedom and confidence. Here, they struck a symbol of our strength in the world. And the attack on the Pentagon, on that day, was more symbolic than they knew. It was on another September 11th -- September 11th, 1941 -- that construction on this building first began. America wasjust then awakening to another menace: The Nazi terror in Europe. And on that very night, President Franklin Roosevelt spoke to the nation. ""The danger,"" he warned, ""has long ceased to be a mere possibility. The danger is here now -- not only from amilitary enemy, but from an enemy of all law, all liberty, all morality, all religion.""1 For us too, in the year 2001, an enemy has emerged that rejects every limit of law, morality, and religion. The terrorists have no true home in any country, or culture, or faith. They dwellin dark corners of earth. And there, we will find them. This week, I have called -- This week, I have called the Armed Forces into action. One by one, we are eliminating power centers of a regime that harbors al Qaeda terrorists. We gavethat regime a choice: Turn over the terrorists, or face your ruin. They chose unwisely. The Taliban regime has brought nothing but fear and misery to the people of Afghanistan. These rulers call themselves holy men, even with their record of drawing money from heroin trafficking. They consider themselves pious and devout, while subjecting womento fierce brutality. The Taliban has allied itself with murderers and gave them shelter. But today, for al Qaeda and the Taliban, there is no shelter. As Americans did 60 years ago, we have entered a struggle of uncertain duration. But now, as then, we can be certain of the outcome, becausewe have a number of decisive assets. We have a unified country. We have the patience to fight and win on many fronts: Blocking terrorist plans, seizing their funds, arresting their networks, disrupting their communications, opposing their sponsors. And we have one more great asset in this cause: The brave menand women of the United States military. From my first days in this office, I have felt and seen the strong spirit of the Armed Forces. I saw it at Fort Stewart, Georgia, when I first reviewed our troops as Commander-in-Chief, and looked into the faces of proud and determined soldiers. I saw it in Annapolis on a graduation day; at Camp Pendleton in California; Camp Bondsteel in Kosovo. And I have seenthis spirit at the Pentagon, before and after the attack on this building. You've responded to a great emergency with calm and courage. And for that, your country honors you. A Commander-in-Chief must know -- must know -- that he can count on the skill and readiness of servicemen and women at every point in the chain of command. You havegiven me that confidence. And I give you these commitments. The wound to this building will not be forgotten, but it will be repaired. Brick by brick, we will quickly rebuild the Pentagon. In the missions ahead for the military, you will have everything you need, every resource, every weapon, everymeans to assure full victory for the United States and the cause of freedom. And I pledge to you that America will never relent on this war against terror. There will be times of swift, dramatic action. There will be times of steady, quiet progress. Over time, with patience, and precision, the terrorists will be pursued. They will be isolated, surrounded,cornered, until there is no place to run, or hide, or rest. As military and civilian personnel in the Pentagon, you are an important part of the struggle we have entered. You know the risks of your calling, and you have willingly acceptedthem. You believe in our country, and our country believes in you. Within sight of this building is Arlington [National] Cemetery, the final resting place of many thousands who died for our country over the generations. Enemies of America have now added to these graves, and they wish to add more. Unlike our enemies, we value every life,and we mourn every loss. Yet we're not afraid. Our cause is just, and worthy of sacrifice. Our nation is strong of heart, firm of purpose. Inspired by all the courage that has come before, we will meet our momentand we will prevail. May God bless you all, and may God bless America. 1 Roosevelt, F.D. (September 11, 1941). Fireside Chat 18: On The Greer Incident.",bush
"Good morning and welcome to the White House. Today, we take an essential step in defeating terrorism, while protecting the constitutional rights of all Americans. With my signature, this law will give intelligence and law enforcement officials important new tools tofight a present danger. I commend the House and Senate for the hard work they put into this legislation. Members of Congress and their staffs spent long nights and weekends to get this important bill to mydesk. I appreciate their efforts, and bipartisanship, in passing this new law. I want to thank the Vice President and his staff for working hard to make sure this law was passed. I want to thank the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Treasury for being here, both of whom lead important parts of our war against terrorism. I want to thank Attorney General John Ashcroft for spending a lot of time on the Hill to make the case for a balanced piece of legislation. I want to thank the Director of the FBI and the Director of the CIA for waging an incredibly important part on the two-front war -- one overseas, and a front here athome. I want to thank Governor Tom Ridge for his leadership. I want to thank the members of Congress who are here on the stage, the Leaders, on this impressive effort. Senator Hatchand Senator Leahy and Senator Sarbanes and Senator Graham and Senator Reid. I also want to thank Representative Porter Goss, LaFalce, Oxley, and Sensenbrenner for their hard work. And I want to welcome the men and women of law enforcement who are here inthe White House with us today, as well. The changes, effective today, will help counter a threat like no other our nation has ever faced. We've seen the enemy, and the murder of thousands of innocent, unsuspecting people. They recognize no barrier of morality. They have no conscience. The terroristscannot be reasoned with. Witness the recent anthrax attacks through our Postal Service. Our country is grateful for the courage the Postal Service has shown during these difficult times. We mourn the loss of the lives of Thomas Morris and Joseph Curseen; postal workerswho died in the line of duty. And our prayers go to their loved ones. I want to assure postal workers that our government is testing more than 200 postal facilities along the entire Eastern corridor that may have been impacted. And we will move quickly totreat and protect workers where positive exposures are found. But one thing is for certain: These terrorists must be pursued, they must be defeated, and they must be brought to justice. (Applause.) And that is the purpose of this legislation. Since the 11th of September, the men and women of our intelligence and lawenforcement agencies have been relentless in their response to new and sudden challenges. We have seen the horrors terrorists can inflict. We may never know what horrors our country was spared by the diligent and determined work of our police forces, the FBI, ATF agents, federal marshals, Custom officers, Secret Service, intelligence professionals and local law enforcement officials, under the most trying conditions. They are serving this country withexcellence, and often with bravery. They deserve our full support and every means of help that we can provide. We're dealing with terrorists who operate by highly sophisticated methods and technologies, some of which were not even available when our existing laws were written. The bill before me takes account of the new realities and dangers posed by modern terrorists. It will help lawenforcement to identify, to dismantle, to disrupt, and to punish terrorists before they strike. For example, this legislation gives law enforcement officials better tools to put an end to financial counterfeiting, smuggling and money-laundering. Secondly, it gives intelligence operations and criminal operations the chance to operate not on separate tracks, but to sharevital information so necessary to disrupt a terrorist attack before it occurs. As of today, we're changing the laws governing information-sharing. And as importantly, we're changing the culture of our various agencies that fight terrorism. Countering and investigating terrorist activity is the number one priority for both law enforcement andintelligence agencies. Surveillance of communications is another essential tool to pursue and stop terrorists. The existing law was written in the era of rotary telephones. This new law that I sign today will allow surveillance of all communications used by terrorists, including e-mails, the Internet,and cell phones. As of today, we'll be able to better meet the technological challenges posed by this proliferation of communications technology. Investigations are often slowed by limit on thereach of federal search warrants. Law enforcement agencies have to get a new warrant for each new district they investigate, even when they're after the same suspect. Under this new law, warrants are valid across all districts and across all states. And, finally, the new legislation greatly enhances the penaltiesthat will fall on terrorists or anyone who helps them. Current statutes deal more severely with drug-traffickers than with terrorists. That changes today. We are enacting new and harsh penalties for possession of biological weapons. We're making it easier to seize the assets of groups and individuals involved in terrorism. The government will have wider latitude in deporting known terrorists and their supporters. The statute of limitations on terrorist acts will be lengthened, as will prison sentences forterrorists. This bill was carefully drafted and considered. Led by the members of Congress on this stage, and those seated in the audience, it was crafted with skill and care, determination and a spirit of bipartisanship for which the entire nation is grateful. This bill met with an overwhelming -- overwhelming agreement in Congress, because it upholds and respects the civil libertiesguaranteed by our Constitution. This legislation is essential not only to pursuing and punishing terrorists, but also preventing more atrocities in the hands of the evil ones. This government will enforce this law with all the urgency of a nation at war. The elected branches of our government, and both political parties, are united in our resolve to fight and stop and punish those who would do harm to theAmerican people. It is now my honor to sign into law the USA Patriot Act of 2001.",bush
"We meet in a hall devoted to peace, in a city scarred by violence, in a nation awakened to danger, in a world uniting for a long struggle. Every civilized nation here today is resolved to keep the most basic commitment of civilization: We will defend ourselves and our futureagainst terror and lawless violence. The United Nations was founded in this cause. In a second world war, we learned there is no isolation from evil. We affirmed that some crimes are so terrible they offend humanity, itself. And we resolved that the aggressions and ambitions of the wicked must be opposed early, decisively, and collectively, before they threaten us all. That evil has returned, and thatcause is renewed. A few miles from here, many thousands still lie in a tomb of rubble. Tomorrow, the Secretary General, the President of the General Assembly, and I will visit that site, where the names of every nation and region that lost citizens will be read aloud. If we were to read the names ofevery person who died, it would take more than three hours. Those names include a citizen of Gambia, whose wife spent their fourth wedding anniversary, September the 12th, searching in vain for her husband. Those names include a man who supported his wife in Mexico, sending home money every week. Those names include a young Pakistani who prayed toward Mecca five times a day, and died that day trying to saveothers. The suffering of September the 11th was inflicted on people of many faiths and many nations. All of the victims, including Muslims, were killed with equal indifference and equal satisfaction by the terrorist leaders. The terrorists are violating the tenets of every religion,including the one they invoke. Last week, the Sheikh of Al-Azhar University, the world's oldest Islamic institution of higher learning, declared that terrorism is a disease, and that Islam prohibits killing innocent civilians. The terrorists call their cause holy, yet, they fund it with drug dealing; they encourage murder and suicide in the name of a great faith that forbids both. They dare to ask God's blessing as they set out to kill innocent men, women and children. But the God of Isaac and Ishmael would never answer such a prayer. And a murderer is not a martyr; he is just amurderer. Time is passing. Yet, for the United States of America, there will be no forgetting September the 11th. We will remember every rescuer who died in honor. We will remember every family that lives in grief. We will remember the fire and ash, the last phone calls, the funerals of thechildren. And the people of my country will remember those who have plotted against us. We are learning their names. We are coming to know their faces. There is no corner of the Earthdistant or dark enough to protect them. However long it takes, their hour of justice will come. Every nation has a stake in this cause. As we meet, the terrorists are planning more murder - - perhaps in my country, or perhaps in yours. They kill because they aspire todominate. They seek to overthrow governments and destabilize entire regions. Last week, anticipating this meeting of the General Assembly, they denounced the United Nations. They called our Secretary General a criminal and condemned all Arab nations hereas traitors to Islam. Few countries meet their exacting standards of brutality and oppression. Every other country is a potential target. And all the world faces the most horrifying prospect of all: These same terrorists are searching for weapons of mass destruction, the tools to turn their hatred into holocaust. They can be expected to use chemical, biological and nuclear weapons themoment they are capable of doing so. No hint of conscience would prevent it. This threat cannot be ignored. This threat cannot be appeased. Civilization, itself, the civilization we share, is threatened. History will record our response, and judge or justifyevery nation in this hall. The civilized world is now responding. We act to defend ourselves and deliver our children from a future of fear. We choose the dignity of life over a culture of death. We choose lawful change and civil disagreement over coercion, subversion, and chaos. These commitments -- hope and order, law and life -- unite people across cultures and continents. Upon these commitments depend all peace and progress. For these commitments, we are determined tofight. The United Nations has risen to this responsibility. On the 12th of September, these buildings opened for emergency meetings of the General Assembly and the Security Council. Before the sun had set, these attacks on the world stood condemned by the world. And I want tothank you for this strong and principled stand. I also thank the Arab Islamic countries that have condemned terrorist murder. Many of you have seen the destruction of terror in your own lands. The terrorists are increasingly isolated by their own hatred and extremism. They cannot hide behind Islam. The authors of massmurder and their allies have no place in any culture, and no home in any faith. The conspiracies of terror are being answered by an expanding global coalition. Not every nation will be a part of every action against the enemy. But every nation in our coalition has duties. These duties can be demanding, as we in America are learning. We have already made adjustments in our laws and in our daily lives. We're taking new measures toinvestigate terror and to protect against threats. The leaders of all nations must now carefully consider their responsibilities and their future. Terrorist groups like al Qaeda depend upon the aid or indifference of governments. They need the support of a financial infrastructure, and safe havens to trainand plan and hide. Some nations want to play their part in the fight against terror, but tell us they lack the means to enforce their laws and control their borders. We stand ready to help. Some governments still turn a blind eye to the terrorists, hoping the threat will pass them by. They are mistaken. And some governments, while pledging to uphold the principles of the U.N., have cast their lot with the terrorists. They support them and harbor them, and they will findthat their welcome guests are parasites that will weaken them, and eventually consume them. For every regime that sponsors terror, there is a price to be paid. And it will be paid. Theallies of terror are equally guilty of murder and equally accountable to justice. The Taliban are now learning this lesson -- that regime and the terrorists who support it are now virtually indistinguishable. Together they promote terror abroad and impose a reign of terror on the Afghan people. Women are executed in Kabal's soccer stadium. They can bebeaten for wearing socks that are too thin. Men are jailed for missing prayer meetings. The United States, supported by many nations, is bringing justice to the terrorists in Afghanistan. We're making progress against military targets, and that is our objective. Unlikethe enemy, we seek to minimize, not maximize, the loss of innocent life. I'm proud of the honorable conduct of the American military. And my country grieves for all the suffering the Taliban have brought upon Afghanistan, including the terrible burden of war. The Afghan people do not deserve their present rulers. Years of Taliban misrule have brought nothing but misery and starvation. Even before this current crisis, 4 million Afghans depended on food from the United Statesand other nations, and millions of Afghans were refugees from Taliban oppression. I make this promise to all the victims of that regime: The Taliban's days of harboring terrorists and dealing in heroin and brutalizing women are drawing to a close. And when thatregime is gone, the people of Afghanistan will say with the rest of the world: good riddance. I can promise, too, that America will join the world in helping the people of Afghanistan rebuild their country. Many nations, including mine, are sending food and medicine to help Afghans through the winter. America has air-dropped over 1.3 million packages of rations into Afghanistan. Just this week, we air-lifted 20,000 blankets and over 200 tons of provisions into the region. We continue to provide humanitarian aid, even while the Taliban tried to stealthe food we send. More help eventually will be needed. The United States will work closely with the United Nations and development banks to reconstruct Afghanistan after hostilities there have ceased and the Taliban are no longer in control. And the United States will work with the U.N. tosupport a post-Taliban government that represents all of the Afghan people. In this war of terror, each of us must answer for what we have done or what we have left undone. After tragedy, there is a time for sympathy and condolence. And my country has been very grateful for both. The memorials and vigils around the world will not beforgotten. But the time for sympathy has now passed; the time for action has now arrived. The most basic obligations in this new conflict have already been defined by the United Nations. On September the 28th, the Security Council adopted Resolution 1373. Its requirements are clear: Every United Nations member has a responsibility to crack down on terrorist financing. We must pass all necessary laws in our own countries to allow the confiscation of terrorist assets. We must apply those laws to every financial institution inevery nation. We have a responsibility to share intelligence and coordinate the efforts of law enforcement. If you know something, tell us. If we know something, we'll tell you. And when we find the terrorists, we must work together to bring them to justice. We have a responsibility to deny any sanctuary, safe haven or transit to terrorists. Every known terrorist camp must be shut down, its operators apprehended, and evidence of their arrest presented to the United Nations. We have a responsibility to deny weapons toterrorists and to actively prevent private citizens from providing them. These obligations are urgent and they are binding on every nation with a place in this chamber. Many governments are taking these obligations seriously, and my country appreciates it. Yet, even beyond Resolution 1373, more is required, and more is expected ofour coalition against terror. We're asking for a comprehensive commitment to this fight. We must unite in opposing all terrorists, not just some of them. In this world there are good causes and bad causes, and we may disagree on where the line is drawn. Yet, there is no such thing as a good terrorist. No national aspiration, no remembered wrong can ever justify the deliberate murder of the innocent. Any government that rejects this principle, trying to pick and choose itsterrorist friends, will know the consequences. We must speak the truth about terror. Let us never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning the attacks of September the 11th; malicious lies that attempt to shift the blame away from the terrorists, themselves, away from the guilty. To inflame ethnic hatred is toadvance the cause of terror. The war against terror must not serve as an excuse to persecute ethnic and religious minorities in any country. Innocent people must be allowed to live their own lives, by their own customs, under their own religion. And every nation must have avenues for the peaceful expression of opinion and dissent. When these avenues are closed, the temptation to speakthrough violence grows. We must press on with our agenda for peace and prosperity in every land. My country is pledged to encouraging development and expanding trade. My country is pledged to investing in education and combating AIDS and other infectious diseases around the world. Following September 11th, these pledges are even more important. In our struggle against hatefulgroups that exploit poverty and despair, we must offer an alternative of opportunity and hope. The American government also stands by its commitment to a just peace in the Middle East. We are working toward a day when two states, Israel and Palestine, live peacefully together within secure and recognize borders as called for by the Security Council resolutions. We will do all in our power to bring both parties back into negotiations. Butpeace will only come when all have sworn off, forever, incitement, violence and terror. And, finally, this struggle is a defining moment for the United Nations, itself. And the world needs its principled leadership. It undermines the credibility of this great institution, for example, when the Commission on Human Rights offers seats to the world's most persistent The steps I described will not be easy. For all nations, they will require effort. For some nations, they will require great courage. Yet, the cost of inaction is far greater. The onlyalternative to victory is a nightmare world where every city is a potential killing field. As I've told the American people, freedom and fear are at war. We face enemies that hate not our policies, but our existence; the tolerance of openness and creative culture that defines us. But the outcome of this conflict is certain: There is a current in history and it runs toward freedom. Our enemies resent it and dismiss it, but the dreams of mankind are defined by liberty -- the natural right to create and build and worship and live in dignity. When men and women are released from oppression and isolation, they find fulfillment and hope, and theyleave poverty by the millions. These aspirations are lifting up the peoples of Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas, and theycan lift up all of the Islamic world. We stand for the permanent hopes of humanity, and those hopes will not be denied. We're confident, too, that history has an author who fills time and eternity with his purpose. We know that evil is real, but good will prevail against it. This is the teaching of many faiths, andin that assurance we gain strength for a long journey. It is our task -- the task of this generation -- to provide the response to aggression andterror. We have no other choice, because there is no other peace. We did not ask for this mission, yet there is honor in history's call. We have a chance to write the story of our times, a story of courage defeating cruelty and light overcoming darkness. This calling is worthy of any life, and worthy of every nation. So let us go forward,confident, determined, and unafraid. Thank you very much.",bush
"Thank you, all. Chief Justice Rehnquist, President Carter, President Bush, President Clinton, distinguishedguests and my fellow citizens: The peaceful transfer of authority is rare in history, yet common in our country. With a simpleoath, we affirm old traditions and make new beginnings. As I begin, I thank President Clinton for his service to our nation. And I thank Vice President Gore for a contest conducted with spirit and ended with grace. I am honored and humbled to stand here, where so many of America's leaders have comebefore me, and so many will follow. We have a place, all of us, in a long story -- a story we continue, but whose end we will notsee. It is a story of a new world that became a friend and liberator of the old, a story of aslave-holding society that became a servant of freedom, the story of a power that went intothe world to protect but not possess, to defend but not to conquer. It is the American story -- a story of flawed and fallible people, united across the generationsby grand and enduring ideals. The grandest of these ideals is an unfolding American promisethat everyone belongs, that everyone deserves a chance, that no insignificant person wasever born. Americans are called to enact this promise in our lives and in our laws. And thoughour nation has sometimes halted, and sometimes delayed, we must follow no other course. Through much of the last century, America's faith in freedom and democracy was a rock in araging sea. Now it is a seed upon the wind, taking root in many nations. Our democratic faithis more than the creed of our country, it is the inborn hope of our humanity, an ideal we carrybut do not own, a trust we bear and pass along. And even after nearly 225 years, we have along way yet to travel. While many of our citizens prosper, others doubt the promise, even the justice, of our owncountry. The ambitions of some Americans are limited by failing schools and hidden prejudiceand the circumstances of their birth. And sometimes our differences run so deep, it seems weshare a continent, but not a country. We do not accept this, and we will not allow it. Ourunity, our union, is the serious work of leaders and citizens in every generation. And this is my solemn pledge: I will work to build a single nation of justice and opportunity. I know this is in our reach because we are guided by a Power larger than ourselves whocreates us equal in His image. And we are confident in principles that unite and lead us onward. America has never beenunited by blood or birth or soil. We are bound by ideals that move us beyond ourbackgrounds, lift us above our interests and teach us what it means to be citizens. Every childmust be taught these principles. Every citizen must uphold them. And every immigrant, byembracing these ideals, makes our country more, not less, American. Today -- Today we affirm a new commitment to live out our nation's promise through civility,courage, compassion, and character. America, at its best, matches a commitment to principlewith a concern for civility. A civil society demands from each of us good will and respect, fairdealing and forgiveness. Some seem to believe that our politics can afford to be petty because, in a time of peace, thestakes of our debates appear small. But the stakes for America are never small. If our countrydoes not lead the cause of freedom, it will not be led. If we do not turn the hearts of childrentoward knowledge and character, we will lose their gifts and undermine their idealism. If wepermit our economy to drift and decline, the vulnerable will suffer most. We must live up to the calling we share. Civility is not a tactic or a sentiment. It is thedetermined choice of trust over cynicism, of community over chaos. And this commitment, ifwe keep it, is a way to shared accomplishment. America, at its best, is also courageous. Our national courage has been clear in times ofdepression and war, when defeating common dangers defined our common good. Now wemust choose if the example of our fathers and mothers will inspire us or condemn us. Wemust show courage in a time of blessing by confronting problems instead of passing them onto future generations. Together, we will reclaim America's schools, before ignorance and apathy claim more younglives. We will reform Social Security and Medicare, sparing our children from struggles wehave the power to prevent. And we'll reduce taxes, to recover the momentum of our economyand reward the effort and enterprise of working Americans. We will build our defenses beyondchallenge, lest weakness invite challenge. We will confront weapons of mass destruction, sothat a new century is spared new horrors. The enemies of liberty and our country should make no mistake: America remains engaged inthe world by history and by choice, shaping a balance of power that favors freedom. We willdefend our allies and our interests. We will show purpose without arrogance. We will meetaggression and bad faith with resolve and strength. And to all nations, we will speak for thevalues that gave our nation birth. America, at its best, is compassionate. In the quiet of American conscience, we know thatdeep, persistent poverty is unworthy of our nation's promise. And whatever our views of itscause, we can agree that children at risk are not at fault. Abandonment and abuse are notacts of God, they are failures of love. And the proliferation of prisons, however necessary, isno substitute for hope and order in our souls. Where there is suffering, there is duty.Americans in need are not strangers, they are citizens, not problems, but priorities. And all ofus are diminished when any are hopeless. Government has great responsibilities for public safety and public health, for civil rights andcommon schools. Yet compassion is the work of a nation, not just a government. And someneeds and hurts are so deep they will only respond to a mentor's touch or a pastor's prayer.Church and charity, synagogue and mosque lend our communities their humanity, and theywill have an honored place in our plans and in our laws. Many in our country do not know the pain of poverty, but we can listen to those who do. And Ican pledge our nation to a goal: When we see that wounded traveler on the road to Jericho,we will not pass to the other side. America, at its best, is a place where personal responsibility is valued and expected.Encouraging responsibility is not a search for scapegoats, it is a call to conscience. And thoughit requires sacrifice, it brings a deeper fulfillment. We find the fullness of life not only inoptions, but in commitments. And we find that children and community are the commitmentsthat set us free. Our public interest depends on private character, on civic duty and family bonds and basicfairness, on -- on uncounted, unhonored acts of decency which give direction to our freedom.Sometimes in life we're called to do great things. But as a saint of our times has said, everyday we are called to ""do small things with great love.""   The most important tasks of ademocracy are done by everyone. I will live and lead by these principles: to advance my convictions with civility, to pursue thepublic interest with courage, to speak for greater justice and compassion, to call forresponsibility and try to live it as well. In all these ways, I will bring the values of our historyto the care of our times. What you do is as important as anything government does. I ask you to seek a common goodbeyond your comfort; to defend needed reforms against easy attacks; to serve your nation,beginning with your neighbor. I ask you to be citizens: citizens, not spectators; citizens, notsubjects; responsible citizens, building communities of service and a nation of character. Americans are generous and strong and decent, not because we believe in ourselves, butbecause we hold beliefs beyond ourselves. When this spirit of citizenship is missing, nogovernment program can replace it. When this spirit is present, no wrong can stand against it. Much time has passed since Jefferson arrived for his inauguration. The years and changesaccumulate. But the themes of this day he would know: our nation's grand story of courageand its simple dream of dignity. We are not this story's Author, who fills time and eternity with His purpose. Yet His purpose isachieved in our duty, and our duty is fulfilled in service to one another. Never tiring, never yielding, never finishing, we renew that purpose today, to make ourcountry more just and generous, to affirm the dignity of our lives and every life. This work continues. The story goes on. And an angel still rides in the whirlwind and directsthis storm. God bless you all, and God bless America.",bush
"I'm glad to be back here at the Citadel. I have come to talk about the future security of our country, in a place where I took up this subject two years ago when I was candidate for President. In September 1999, I said here at the Citadel that America was entering a period of consequences that would be defined by the threat of terror, and that we faced a challenge of military transformation. That threat has now revealed itself, and that challenge is now the military and moral necessity of our time. So,today, I will set forth the commitments essential to victory in our war against terror. I want to thank Major General John Grinalds for his hospitality. I want to thank the Citadel Board of Visitors, the staff, and the faculty. I understand the Governor is here. And I know my friends, the Lt. Governor, the Speaker and the Attorney General are here, and it was great to have seen them at the airport. I thank my friend, Adjutant General Stan Spears for beinghere. I'm grateful that Senator Hollings and members of the South Carolina congressional delegation flew down on Air Force One. I only wish that the senior Senator was on theairplane so I could have wished him a happy 99th birthday. But most of all, most of all, I want to say how much I appreciate being in the presence ofsome of America's finest, the South Carolina Corp of Cadets of Citadel. Four days ago, I joined the men and women of the USS Enterprise to mark the 60th anniversary of Pearl Harbor. December 7th, 1941 was a decisive day that changed our nation forever. In a single moment, America's ""splendid isolation"" was ended. And the four yearsthat followed transformed the American way of war. The age of battleships gave way to the offensive capability of aircraft carriers. The tank, once used only to protect infantry, now served to cut through enemy lines. At Guadalcanal, and Normandy, and Iwo Jima, amphibious warfare proved its worth. And by war's end, no onewould ever again doubt the value of strategic air power. Even more importantly, an American President and his successors shaped a world beyond a war. They rebuilt Europe with the Marshall Plan, formed a great alliance for freedom in NATO, and expressed the hope of collective security in the United Nations. America took the lead,becoming freedom's defender and assuming responsibilities that only we could bear. September 11th, 2001 -- three months and a long time ago -- set another dividing line in our lives and in the life of our nation. An illusion of immunity was shattered. A faraway evil became a present danger. And a great cause became clear: We will fight terror and thosewho sponsor it, to save our children from a future of fear. To win this war, we have to think differently. The enemy who appeared on September 11th seeks to evade our strength and constantly searches for our weaknesses. So America is required once again to change the way our military thinks and fights. And starting on October 7th, the enemy in Afghanistan got the first glimpses of a new American military that cannot,and will not, be evaded. When I committed U.S. forces to this battle, I had every confidence that they would be up to the task. And they have proven me right. The Taliban and the terrorists set out to dominate a country and intimidate the world. Today, from their caves, it's all looking a little different. And no cave is deep enough to escape the patient justice of the United States ofAmerica. We are also beginning to see the possibilities of a world beyond the war on terror. We have a chance, if we take it, to write a hopeful chapter in human history. All at once, a new threat to civilization is erasing old lines of rivalry and resentment between nations. Russia and America are building a new cooperative relationship. India and the United States are increasingly aligned across a range of issues, even as we work closely with Pakistan. Germany and Japanare assuming new military roles, appropriate to their status as great democracies. The vast majority of countries are now on the same side of a moral and ideological divide. We're making common cause with every nation that chooses lawful change overchaotic violence -- every nation that values peace and safety and innocent life. Staring across this divide are bands of murderers, supported by outlaw regimes. They are a movement defined by their hatreds. They hate progress, and freedom, and choice, and culture, and music, and laughter, and women, and Christians, and Jews, and all Muslims who reject their distorted doctrines. They love only one thing -- they love power. And when theyhave it, they use it without mercy. The great threat to civilization is not that the terrorists will inspire millions. Only the terrorists themselves would want to live in their brutal and joyless world. The great threat to civilization is that a few evil men will multiply their murders, and gain the means to kill on a scale equalto their hatred. We know they have this mad intent, and we're determined to stop them. Our lives, our way of life, and our every hope for the world depend on a single commitment: The authors of mass murder must be defeated, and never allowed to gain oruse the weapons of mass destruction. America and our friends will meet this threat with every method at our disposal. We will discover and destroy sleeper cells. We will track terrorist movements, trace theircommunications, disrupt their funding, and take their network apart, piece by piece. Above all, we're acting to end the state sponsorship of terror. Rogue states are clearly the most likely sources of chemical and biological and nuclear weapons for terrorists. Every nation now knows that we cannot accept -- and we will not accept -- states that harbor, finance, train, or equip the agents of terror. Those nations that violate this principle will be regarded as hostile regimes. They have been warned, they are being watched, and they willbe held to account. Preventing mass terror will be the responsibilities of Presidents far into the future. And this obligation sets three urgent and enduring priorities for America. The first priority is to speedthe transformation of our military. When the Cold War ended, some predicted that the era of direct threats to our nation was over. Some thought our military would be used overseas -- not to win wars, but mainly topolice and pacify, to control crowds and contain ethnic conflict. They were wrong. While the threats to America have changed, the need for victory has not. We are fighting shadowy, entrenched enemies -- enemies using the tools of terror and guerrilla war -- yet we are finding new tactics and new weapons to attack and defeat them. This revolution in ourmilitary is only beginning, and it promises to change the face of battle. Afghanistan has been a proving ground for this new approach. These past two months have shown that an innovative doctrine and high-tech weaponry can shape and then dominate an unconventional conflict. The brave men and women of our military are rewriting the rules of war with new technologies and old values like courage and honor. And they have made thisnation proud. Our commanders are gaining a real-time picture of the entire battlefield, and are able to get targeting information from sensor to shooter almost instantly. Our intelligence professionals and special forces have cooperated in battle-friendly -- with battle-friendly Afghan forces -- fighters who know the terrain, who know the Taliban, and who understand the local culture. And our special forces have the technology to call in precision air strikes -- along with the flexibility to direct those strikes from horseback, in the first cavalry charge of the 21stcentury. This combination -- real-time intelligence, local allied forces, special forces, and precision air power -- has really never been used before. The conflict in Afghanistan has taught us more about the future of our military than a decade of blue ribbon panels and think-tanksymposiums. The Predator is a good example. This unmanned aerial vehicle is able to circle over enemy forces, gather intelligence, transmit information instantly back to commanders, then fire ontargets with extreme accuracy. Before the war, the Predator had skeptics, because it did not fit the old ways. Now it is clear the military does not have enough unmanned vehicles. We're entering an era in which unmanned vehicles of all kinds will take on greater importance -- in space, on land, in the air,and at sea. Precision-guided munitions also offer great promise. In the Gulf War, these weapons were the exception -- while in Afghanistan, they have been the majority of the munitions we have used. We're striking with greater effectiveness, at greater range, with fewer civilian casualties. More and more, our weapons can hit moving targets. When all of our military can continuously locate and track moving targets -- with surveillance from air and space --warfare will be truly revolutionized. The need for military transformation was clear before the conflict in Afghanistan, and before September the 11th. Here at the Citadel in 1999, I spoke of keeping the peace by redefining war on our terms. The same recommendation was made in the strategic review that Secretary Rumsfeld briefed me on last August -- a review that I fully endorse. What's different today is our sense of urgency -- the need to build this future force while fighting a present war. It's like overhauling an engine while you're going at 80 miles an hour. Yet wehave no other choice. Our military has a new and essential mission. For states that support terror, it's not enough that the consequences be costly -- they must be devastating. The more credible this reality, the more likely that regimes will change their behavior -- making it less likely that Americaand our friends will need to use overwhelming force against them. To build our future force, the Armed Services must continue to attract America's best people, with good pay and good living conditions. Our military culture must reward new thinking, innovation, and experimentation. Congress must give defense leaders the freedom to innovate, instead of micromanaging the Defense Department. And every service and every constituency of our military must be willing to sacrifice some of their own pet projects. Our war on terror cannot be used to justify obsolete bases, obsolete programs, or obsolete weapon systems. Every dollar of defense spending must meet a single test: It must help usbuild the decisive power we will need to win the wars of the future. Our country is united in supporting a great cause -- and in supporting those who fight for it. We will give our men and women in uniform every resource, every weapon, every toolthey need to win the long battle that lies ahead. America's next priority to prevent mass terror is to protect against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them. I wish I could report to the American people that this threat does not exist -- that our enemy is content with car bombsand box cutters -- but I cannot. One former al Qaeda member has testified in court that he was involved in an effort 10 years ago to obtain nuclear materials. And the leader of al Qaeda calls that effort ""a religious duty."" Abandoned al Qaeda houses in Kabul contained diagrams for crude weapons of mass destruction. And as we all know, terrorists have put anthrax into the U.S. mail, and usedsarin gas in a Tokyo subway. And almost every state that actively sponsors terror is known to be seeking weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them at longer and longer ranges. Their hope is to blackmail the United States into abandoning our war on terror, and forsaking our friends and allies and security commitments around the world. Our enemies are bound for disappointment. America will never be blackmailed, and we will never forsake ourcommitment to liberty. To meet our new threats, I have directed my National Security Advisor and my Homeland Security Director to develop a comprehensive strategy on proliferation. Working with other countries, we will strengthen nonproliferation treaties and toughen export controls. Together, we must keep the world's most dangerous technologies out of the hands of theworld's most dangerous people. A crucial partner in this effort is Russia -- a nation we are helping to dismantle strategic weapons, reduce nuclear material, and increase security at nuclear sites. Our two countries will expand efforts to provide peaceful employment for scientists who formerly worked in Soviet weapons facilities. The United States will also work with Russia to build a facility to destroy tons of nerve agent. I'll request an over-all increase in funding to support this vitalmission. Even as we fight to prevent proliferation, we must prepare for every possibility. At home, we must be better prepared to detect, protect against, and respond to the potential use of weapons of mass destruction. Abroad, our military forces must have the ability to fight andwin against enemies who would use such weapons against us. Biodefense has become a major initiative of ours. This year we've already requested nearly $3 billion additional dollars for biodefense, more than doubling the level of funding prior toSeptember the 11th. The attacks on our nation made it even more clear that we need to build limited and effective defenses against a missile attack. Our enemies seek every chance and every means to doharm to our country, our forces, and our friends. And we will not permit it. Suppose the Taliban and the terrorists had been able to strike America or important allies with a ballistic missile. Our coalition would have become fragile, the stakes in our war much, much higher. We must protect Americans and our friends against all forms of terror, including theterror that could arrive on a missile. Last week we conducted another promising test of our missile defense technology. For the good of peace, we're moving forward with an active program to determine what works and what does not work. In order to do so, we must move beyond the 1972 Anti-Ballistic MissileTreaty, a treaty that was written in a different era, for a different enemy. America and our allies must not be bound to the past. We must be able to build the defenseswe need against the enemies of the 21st century. Our third and final priority in the fight against mass terror is to strengthen the advantage that good intelligence gives our country. Every day I make decisions influenced by the intelligence briefing of that morning. To reach decisions, a President needs more than data and information. A President needs real and current knowledge and analysis of the plans,intentions, and capabilities of our enemies. The last several months have shown that there is no substitute for good intelligence officers, people on the ground. These are the people who find the targets, follow our enemies, andhelp us disrupt their evil plans. The United States must rebuild our network of human intelligence. And we will apply the best new technology to gather intelligence on the new threats. Sophisticated systems like Global Hawk, an unmanned surveillance plane, are transforming our intelligence capabilities. Ourtechnological strengths produce great advantages, and we will build on them. Our intelligence services and federal law enforcement agencies must work more closely together, and share timely information with our state and local authorities. The more we know, the more terrorist plans we can prevent and disrupt, and the better we'll be able toprotect the American people. And in all they do, our intelligence agencies must attract the best people -- the best collectors, the best analysts, the best linguists. We will give them the training they need and thecompensation they deserve. There have been times here in America when our intelligence services were held in suspicion, and even contempt. Now, when we face this new war, we know how much we needthem. And for their dedication and for their service, America is grateful. We're also grateful to you, the students of the Citadel. Your uniforms symbolize a tradition of honor and sacrifice, renewed in your own lives. Many of you will enter our military -- taking your place in the war against terror. That struggle may continue for many years, and it maybring great costs. But you will have chosen a great calling at a crucial hour for our nation. The course we follow is a matter of profound consequence to many nations. If America wavers, the world will lose heart. If America leads, the world will show its courage. Americawill never waver. America will lead the world to peace. Our cause is necessary. Our cause is just. And no matter how long it takes, we will defeatthe enemies of freedom. In all that is to come, I know the graduates of the Citadel will bring credit to America, to the military, and to this great institution. In the words of your school song, you will go where you've always gone -- ""in the Paths our fathers showed us...Peace and Honor, God andCountry, We will fight for thee."" God bless.",bush
"memory against forgetting. When we fight terror, we fight tyranny; and so we remember. We remember the perfect blueness of the sky that Tuesday morning. We remember the childrentraveling without their mothers when their planes were hijacked. We remember the cruelty of the murderers and the pain and anguish of the murdered. Every one of the innocents who died on September the 11th was the most important person onearth to somebody. Every death extinguished a world. We remember the courage of the rescue workers and the outpouring of friendship and sympathy from nations around the world. We remember how we felt that day: our sadness,the surge of love for our country, our anger, and our determination to right this huge wrong. Today, the wrong is being righted and justice is being done. We still have far to go. And many dangers lie ahead. Yet, there can be no doubt how this conflict will end. Our enemies have made the mistake that America's enemies always make. They saw liberty and thought theysaw weakness. And now, they see defeat. In time, this war will end. But our remembrance never will. All around this beautiful city are statues of our heroes, memorials, museums and archives that preserve our nationalexperience, our achievements and our failures, our defeats and our victories. This republic is young, but its memory is long. Now, we have inscribed a new memory alongside those others. It's a memory of tragedy and shock, of loss and mourning. But not only of loss and mourning. It's also a memory of bravery and self-sacrifice, and the love thatlays down its life for a friend -- even a friend whose name it never knew. We are privileged to have with us the families of many of the heroes on September the 11th, including the family of Jeremy Glick of Flight 93. His courage and self-sacrifice may havesaved the White House. It is right and fitting that it is here we pay our respects. In time, perhaps, we will mark the memory of September the 11th in stone and metal -- something we can show children as yet unborn to help them understand what happened onthis minute and on this day. But for those of us who lived through these events, the only marker we'll ever need is the tick of a clock at the 46th minute of the eighth hour of the 11th day. We will remember where we were and how we felt. We will remember the dead and what we owe them. We will rememberwhat we lost and what we found. And in our time, we will honor the memory of the 11th day by doing our duty as citizens ofthis great country, freedom's home and freedoms defender. God bless.",bush
"Okay! I know you all are anxious to get back to class. So please be seated. Thank you forsuch a warm welcome. It's great to be in the home of the Big Blue -- Hamilton High School. Iwant to thank you all for coming. I particularly want to thank my friend, the Governor of thegreat state of Ohio, Governor Taft, for being here. I want to thank Tracy Miller for being so hospitable. I want to thank all who have come towitness this historic moment. For those of you who have studied the history of ourgovernment, you know most bills are signed at the White House. But I decided to sign thisbill in one of the most important places in America -- a public school. We've got large challenges here in America. There's no greater challenge than to make surethat every child -- and all of us on this stage mean every child, not just a few children -- everysingle child, regardless of where they live, how they're raised, the income level of their family,every child receive a first-class education in America. And as you know, we've got another challenge, and that's to protect America from evilones. And I want to assure the seniors and juniors and sophomores here at Hamilton HighSchool that the effort that this great country is engaged in, the effort to defend freedom andto defend our people, the effort to rout out terror wherever it exists, is noble and just andright, and your great country will prevail in this effort. I long for peace. But I also understand that if we do not lead the world against terror, thatyour children and your grandchildren will not grow up in a society that is as free as the societywe have today. Freedom is the precious gift that one generation can pass to the next. It is agift and a promise that I intend to keep to the American children. And we owe the children of America a good education. And today begins a new era, a newtime in public education in our country. As of this hour, America's schools will be on a newpath of reform, and a new path of results. Our schools will have higher expectations. We believe every child can learn. Our schools willhave greater resources to help meet those goals. Parents will have more information aboutthe schools, and more say in how their children are educated. From this day forward, allstudents will have a better chance to learn, to excel, and to live out their dreams. I want to thank the Secretary of Education, Rod Paige, for being here and for his leadership. Iasked Rod to join my administration because I wanted somebody who understood what itmeant to run a school district in Washington, D.C. I didn't need somebody that based hisknowledge on theory; I wanted somebody who based his knowledge on experience. And Rodwas a teacher, a school board member, and the Superintendent of the Houston IndependentSchool District. He did a fine job there, and he's doing a fine job in Washington. Reaching this moment has not been easy, as you could tell from Chairman Boehner'sdiscussion. But we made it, because of the willingness of four fine leaders to do what wasright for America. We made it because proud members of the House and the Senate, loyal totheir parties, decided to set partisan politics aside and focus on what was right for America. I want to thank George Miller. I call him Big George, Jorge el Grande. As John mentioned,George and I aren't from the same political ideology -- except when I met with George inAustin, I could tell he shares the same passion I share for making sure that every child getseducated. And he, like me and others, realize that a system that simply shuffles childrenthrough the schools is a system that's going to leave people behind. And so we made up ourminds right then and there to do something about it. I appreciate so very much my friend, Judd Gregg, from the state of New Hampshire, beinghere. He was my campaign manager in the New Hampshire primary. I still invited him tocome with me. After here, we're going to New Hampshire. I look forward to singing Judd'spraises because he is a solid, solid United States senator -- honest, full of integrity, and likethe others here, he buckled down to do what was right for the children. And then, of course, there's Senator Edward Kennedy. And the folks at the Crawford CoffeeShop -- would be somewhat shocked when I told them I actually like the fellow. He is afabulous United States senator. When he's against you, it's tough. When he's with you, it is agreat experience. And I'm signing this bill here because it's the home of the Chairman, John Boehner. John dida really good job. He shepherded the process. He made sure people showed up for themeetings. He was dogged in his determination to get this bill done. It would not havehappened without his leadership. And all four of these members up here need to be proud ofthe legacy they have left behind. This is a good bill for the American children, and I'm proudto sign it in their presence. There are other members of the Congress who are here, as well, and I want to thank them forcoming. Senator Evan Bayh from the state of Indiana, is here. Evan, thank you for yourleadership on education reform. Senator Mike DeWine of your state of Ohio, who helpedauthor -- who helped to author the safe and drug-free schools part of this bill. Thank you foryour leadership. Steve Chabot of Ohio, Van Hilleary of Tennessee -- thank you both for coming, as well. Inthat box is the bill. I don't intend to read it all. It's not exactly light reading. But if you wereto read it all, you would find that it contains some very important principles that will helpguide our public school system for the next decades. First principle is accountability. Every school has a job to do. And that's to teach the basicsand teach them well. If we want to make sure no child is left behind, every child must learnto read. And every child must learn to add and subtract. So in return for federal dollars, weare asking states to design accountability systems to show parents and teachers whether ornot children can read and write and add and subtract in grades three through eight. The fundamental principle of this bill is that every child can learn, we expect every child tolearn, and you must show us whether or not every child is learning. I read a quote one timefrom a young lady in New York. She said, ""I don't ever remember taking an exam. They justkept passing me along. I ended up dropping out in the 7th grade. I basically felt nobodycared."" The story of children being just shuffled through the system is one of the saddest stories ofAmerica. Let's just move them through. It's so much easier to move a child through thantrying to figure out how to solve a child's problems. The first step to making sure that a childis not shuffled through is to test that child as to whether or not he or she can read and write,or add and subtract. The first way to solve a problem is to diagnose it. And so, what this bill says, it says everychild can learn. And we want to know early, before it's too late, whether or not a child has aproblem in learning. I understand taking tests aren't fun. Too bad. We need to know inAmerica. We need to know whether or not children have got the basic education. No longer is it acceptable to hide poor performance. No longer is it acceptable to keep resultsaway from parents. One of the interesting things about this bill, it says that we're never goingto give up on a school that's performing poorly; that when we find poor performance, a schoolwill be given time and incentives and resources to correct their problems. A school will begiven time to try other methodologies, perhaps other leadership, to make sure that peoplecan succeed. If, however, schools don't perform, if, however, given the new resources,focused resources, they are unable to solve the problem of not educating their children, theremust be real consequences. There must be a moment in which parents can say, I've hadenough of this school. Parents must be given real options in the face of failure in order tomake sure reform is meaningful. And so, therefore, this bill's second principle is, is that we trust parents to make the rightdecisions for their children. Any school that doesn't perform, any school that cannot catch upand do its job, a parent will have these options -- a better public school, a tutor, or a charterschool. We do not want children trapped in schools that will not change and will not teach. The third principle of this bill is that we have got to trust the local folks on how to achievestandards, to meet the standards. In Washington, there's some smart people there, but thepeople who care most about the children in Hamilton are the citizens of Hamilton. The peoplewho care most about the children in this school are the teachers and parents and school boardmembers. And therefore, schools not only have the responsibility to improve, they now havethe freedom to improve. The federal government will not micromanage how schools are run. We believe strongly -- webelieve strongly the best path to education reform is to trust the local people. And so the newrole of the federal government is to set high standards, provide resources, hold peopleaccountable, and liberate school districts to meet the standards. I can't think of any better way to say to teachers, we trust you. And, first of all, we've got tothank all the teachers who are here. I thank you for teaching. Yours is indeed a nobleprofession. And our society is better off because you decided to teach. And by saying we trustlocal folks, we're really saying we trust you. We trust you. We want you to have as muchflexibility as possible to see to it that every child that walks in your classroom cansucceed. So thank you for what you do. And a fourth principle is that we're going to spend more money, more resources, but they'll bedirected at methods that work. Not feel-good methods, not sound-good methods, butmethods that actually work. Particularly when it comes to reading. We're going to spendmore on our schools, and we're going to spend it more wisely. If we've learned anything over the last generations, money alone doesn't make a goodschool. It certainly helps. But as John mentioned, we've spent billions of dollars with lousyresults. So now it's time to spend billions of dollars and get good results. As John mentioned, too many of our kids can't read. You know, a huge percentage of childrenin poverty can't read at grade level. That's not right in America. We're going to win the waroverseas, and we need to win the war against illiteracy here at home, as well. And so this bill-- so this bill focuses on reading. It sets a grand goal for the country. Our children will bereading by the third grade. That's not an impossible goal. It's a goal we must meet if we want every child tosucceed. And so, therefore, we tripled the amount of federal funding for scientifically-basedearly reading programs. We've got money in there to make sure teachers know how to teachwhat works. We've got money in there to help promote proven methods of instruction. There are no more excuses, as far as I'm concerned, about not teaching children how toread. We know what works. The money is now available, and it's up to each local district tomake sure it happens. It's up to you, the citizens of Hamilton, to make sure no child is leftbehind. And the federal government can spend money and we can help set standards, and wecan assist upon accountability. But the truth of the matter is our schools will flourish whencitizens join in the noble cause of making sure no child is left behind. This is the end of a legislative process. Signing this bill is the end of a long, long time ofpeople sitting in rooms trying to hammer out differences. It's a great symbol of what ispossible in Washington when good people come together to do what's right. But it's just thebeginning of change. And now it's up to you, the local citizens of our great land, thecompassionate, decent citizens of America, to stand up and demand high standards, and todemand that no child -- not one single child in America -- is left behind. Thank you for letting us come. May God bless.",bush
"Thank  you  very  much.   Mr.  Speaker,  Vice  President  Cheney,  members  of  Congress,  distinguished  guests,  fellow  citizens:  As  we   gather  tonight,  our  nation  is  at  war,  our  economy  is  in  recession,  and  the  civilized  world  faces   unprecedented  dangers.  Yet  the  state  of  our  Union  has  never  been  stronger.   We  last  met  in  an  hour  of  shock  and  suffering.   In  four  short  months,  our  nation  has  comforted  the  victims,   begun  to  rebuild  New  York  and  the  Pentagon,  rallied  a  great  coalition,  captured,  arrested,  and  rid  the  world   of  thousands  of  terrorists,  destroyed  Afghanistan's  terrorist  training  camps,  saved  a  people  from  starvation,   and  freed  a  country  from  brutal  oppression.   The  American  flag  flies  again  over  our  embassy  in  Kabul.  Terrorists  who  once  occupied  Afghanistan  now   occupy  cells  at  Guantanamo  Bay.  And  terrorist  leaders  who  urged  followers  to  sacrifice  their  lives  are   running  for  their  own.   America  and  Afghanistan  are  now  allies  against  terror.  We'll  be  partners  in  rebuilding  that  country.  And  this   evening  we  welcome  the  distinguished  interim  leader  of  a  liberated  Afghanistan:  Chairman  Hamid  Karzai.   The  last  time  we  met  in  this  chamber,  the  mothers  and  daughters  of  Afghanistan  were  captives  in  their  own   homes,  forbidden  from  working  or  going  to  school.   Today  women  are  free,  and  are  part  of  Afghanistan's   new  government.   And  we  welcome  the  new  Minister  of  Women's  Affairs,  Doctor  Sima  Samar.   Our  progress  is  a  tribute  to  the  spirit  of  the  Afghan  people,  to  the  resolve  of  our  coalition,  and  to  the  might  of   the  United  States  military. When  I  called  our  troops  into  action,  I  did  so  with  complete  confidence  in  their   courage  and  skill.  And  tonight,  thanks  to  them,  we  are  winning  the  war  on  terror. Page  1      The  man  and  women  of  our  Armed  Forces  have  delivered  a  message  now  clear  to  every  enemy  of  the   United  States:   Even  7,000  miles  away,  across  oceans  and  continents,  on  mountaintops  and  in  caves        you   will  not  escape  the  justice  of  this  nation.   For  many  Americans,  these  four  months  have  brought  sorrow,  and  pain  that  will  never  completely  go  away.   Every  day  a  retired  firefighter  returns  to  Ground  Zero,  to  feel  closer  to  his  two  sons  who  died  there.  At  a   memorial  in  New  York,  a  little  boy  left  his  football  with  a  note  for  his  lost  father:  Dear  Daddy,  please  take  this   to  heaven.  I  don't  want  to  play  football  until  I  can  play  with  you  again  some  day.   Last  month,  at  the  grave  of  her  husband,  Michael,  a  CIA  officer  and  Marine  who  died  in  Mazur  e  Sharif,   Shannon  Spann  said  these  words  of  farewell:  ""Semper  Fi,  my  love.""  Shannon  is  with  us  tonight.   Shannon,  I  assure  you  and  all  who  have  lost  a  loved  one  that  our  cause  is  just,  and  our  country  will  never   forget  the  debt  we  owe  Michael  and  all  who  gave  their  lives  for  freedom.   Our  cause  is  just,  and  it  continues.  Our  discoveries  in  Afghanistan  confirmed  our  worst  fears,  and  showed   us  the  true  scope  of  the  task  ahead.  We  have  seen  the  depth  of  our  enemies'  hatred  in  videos,  where  they   laugh  about  the  loss  of  innocent  life.  And  the  depth  of  their  hatred  is  equaled  by  the  madness  of  the   destruction  they  design.  We  have  found  diagrams  of  American  nuclear  power  plants  and  public  water   facilities,  detailed  instructions  for  making  chemical  weapons,  surveillance  maps  of  American  cities,  and   thorough  descriptions  of  landmarks  in  America  and  throughout  the  world.   What  we  have  found  in  Afghanistan  confirms  that,  far  from  ending  there,  our  war  against  terror  is  only   beginning.  Most  of  the  19  men  who  hijacked  planes  on  September  the  11th  were  trained  in  Afghanistan's   camps,  and  so  were  tens  of  thousands  of  others.  Thousands  of  dangerous  killers,  schooled  in  the  methods   of  murder,  often  supported  by  outlaw  regimes,  are  now  spread  throughout  the  world  like  ticking  time  bombs,   set  to  go  off  without  warning.   Thanks  to  the  work  of  our  law  enforcement  officials  and  coalition  partners,  hundreds  of  terrorists  have  been   arrested.  Yet,  tens  of  thousands  of  trained  terrorists  are  still  at  large.  These  enemies  view  the  entire  world   as  a  battlefield,  and  we  must  pursue  them  wherever  they  are.  So  long  as  training  camps  operate,  so  long  as   nations  harbor  terrorists,  freedom  is  at  risk.  And  America  and  our  allies  must  not,  and  will  not,  allow  it.   Our  nation  will  continue  to  be  steadfast  and  patient  and  persistent  in  the  pursuit  of  two  great  objectives.   First,  we  will  shut  down  terrorist  camps,  disrupt  terrorist  plans,  and  bring  terrorists  to  justice.  And,  second,   we  must  prevent  the  terrorists  and  regimes  who  seek  chemical,  biological  or  nuclear  weapons  from   threatening  the  United  States  and  the  world.   Our  military  has  put  the  terror  training  camps  of  Afghanistan  out  of  business,  yet  camps  still  exist  in  at  least   a  dozen  countries.  A  terrorist  underworld        including  groups  like  Hamas,  Hezbollah,  Islamic  Jihad,  Jaish  i     Mohammed        operates  in  remote  jungles  and  deserts,  and  hides  in  the  centers  of  large  cities.   While  the  most  visible  military  action  is  in  Afghanistan,  America  is  acting  elsewhere.  We  now  have  troops  in   the  Philippines,  helping  to  train  that  country's  armed  forces  to  go  after  terrorist  cells  that  have  executed  an   American,  and  still  hold  hostages. Page  2      Our  soldiers,  working  with  the  Bosnian  government,  seized  terrorists  who  were  plotting  to  bomb  our   embassy.  Our  Navy  is  patrolling  the  coast  of  Africa  to  block  the  shipment  of  weapons  and  the  establishment   of  terrorist  camps  in  Somalia.   My  hope  is  that  all  nations  will  heed  our  call,  and  eliminate  the  terrorist  parasites  who  threaten  their   countries  and  our  own.   Many  nations  are  acting  forcefully.  Pakistan  is  now  cracking  down  on  terror,  and  I   admire  the  strong  leadership  of  President  Musharraf.   But  some  governments  will  be  timid  in  the  face  of  terror.  And  make  no  mistake  about  it:  If  they  do  not  act,   America  will.   Our  second  goal  is  to  prevent  regimes  that  sponsor  terror  from  threatening  America  or  our  friends  and  allies   with  weapons  of  mass  destruction.  Some  of  these  regimes  have  been  pretty  quiet  since  September  the   11th.  But  we  know  their  true  nature.  North  Korea  is  a  regime  arming  with  missiles  and  weapons  of  mass   destruction,  while  starving  its  citizens.   Iran  aggressively  pursues  these  weapons  and  exports  terror,  while  an  unelected  few  repress  the  Iranian   people's  hope  for  freedom.   Iraq  continues  to  flaunt  its  hostility  toward  America  and  to  support  terror.  The  Iraqi  regime  has  plotted  to   develop  anthrax,  and  nerve  gas,  and  nuclear  weapons  for  over  a  decade.  This  is  a  regime  that  has  already   used  poison  gas  to  murder  thousands  of  its  own  citizens        leaving  the  bodies  of  mothers  huddled  over  their   dead  children.  This  is  a  regime  that  agreed  to  international  inspections        then  kicked  out  the  inspectors.   This  is  a  regime  that  has  something  to  hide  from  the  civilized  world.   States  like  these,  and  their  terrorist  allies,  constitute  an  axis  of  evil,  arming  to  threaten  the  peace  of  the   world.  By  seeking  weapons  of  mass  destruction,  these  regimes  pose  a  grave  and  growing  danger.  They   could  provide  these  arms  to  terrorists,  giving  them  the  means  to  match  their  hatred.  They  could  attack  our   allies  or  attempt  to  blackmail  the  United  States.  In  any  of  these  cases,  the  price  of  indifference  would  be   catastrophic.   We  will  work  closely  with  our  coalition  to  deny  terrorists  and  their  state  sponsors  the  materials,  technology,   and  expertise  to  make  and  deliver  weapons  of  mass  destruction.  We  will  develop  and  deploy  effective   missile  defenses  to  protect  America  and  our  allies  from  sudden  attack.  And  all  nations  should   know:  America  will  do  what  is  necessary  to  ensure  our  nation's  security.   We'll  be  deliberate,  yet  time  is  not  on  our  side.  I  will  not  wait  on  events,  while  dangers  gather.   I  will  not   stand  by,  as  peril  draws  closer  and  closer.  The  United  States  of  America  will  not  permit  the  world's  most   dangerous  regimes  to  threaten  us  with  the  world's  most  destructive  weapons.   Our  war  on  terror  is  well  begun,  but  it  is  only  begun.  This  campaign  may  not  be  finished  on  our  watch        yet   it  must  be  and  it  will  be  waged  on  our  watch. Page  3      We  can't  stop  short.  If  we  stop  now        leaving  terror  camps  intact  and  terror  states  unchecked        our  sense  of   security  would  be  false  and  temporary.  History  has  called  America  and  our  allies  to  action,  and  it  is  both  our   responsibility  and  our  privilege  to  fight  freedom's  fight.   Our  first  priority  must  always  be  the  security  of  our  nation,  and  that  will  be  reflected  in  the  budget  I  send  to   Congress.  My  budget  supports  three  great  goals  for  America:  We  will  win  this  war    we'll  protect  our   homeland    and  we  will  revive  our  economy.   September  the  11th  brought  out  the  best  in  America,  and  the  best  in  this  Congress.  And  I  join  the  American   people  in  applauding  your  unity  and  resolve.  Now  Americans  deserve  to  have  this  same  spirit  directed   toward  addressing  problems  here  at  home.  I'm  a  proud  member  of  my  party        yet  as  we  act  to  win  the  war,   protect  our  people,  and  create  jobs  in  America,  we  must  act,  first  and  foremost,  not  as  Republicans,  not  as   Democrats,  but  as  Americans.   It  costs  a  lot  to  fight  this  war.   We  have  spent  more  than  a  billion  dollars  a  month        over  $30  million  a  day         and  we  must  be  prepared  for  future  operations.  Afghanistan  proved  that  expensive  precision  weapons   defeat  the  enemy  and  spare  innocent  lives,  and  we  need  more  of  them.  We  need  to  replace  aging  aircraft   and  make  our  military  more  agile,  to  put  our  troops  anywhere  in  the  world  quickly  and  safely.  Our  men  and   women  in  uniform  deserve  the  best  weapons,  the  best  equipment,  the  best  training        and  they  also  deserve   another  pay  raise.   My  budget  includes  the  largest  increase  in  defense  spending  in  two  decades        because  while  the  price  of   freedom  and  security  is  high,  it  is  never  too  high.  Whatever  it  costs  to  defend  our  country,  we  will  pay.   The  next  priority  of  my  budget  is  to  do  everything  possible  to  protect  our  citizens  and  strengthen  our  nation   against  the  ongoing  threat  of  another  attack.  Time  and  distance  from  the  events  of  September  the  11th  will   not  make  us  safer  unless  we  act  on  its  lessons.  America  is  no  longer  protected  by  vast  oceans.  We  are   protected  from  attack  only  by  vigorous  action  abroad,  and  increased  vigilance  at  home.   My  budget  nearly  doubles  funding  for  a  sustained  strategy  of  homeland  security,  focused  on  four  key  areas:   bioterrorism,  emergency  response,  airport  and  border  security,  and  improved  intelligence.   We  will  develop   vaccines  to  fight  anthrax  and  other  deadly  diseases.  We'll  increase  funding  to  help  states  and  communities   train  and  equip  our  heroic  police  and  firefighters.  We  will  improve  intelligence  collection  and  sharing,  expand   patrols  at  our  borders,  strengthen  the  security  of  air  travel,  and  use  technology  to  track  the  arrivals  and   departures  of  visitors  to  the  United  States.   Homeland  security  will  make  America  not  only  stronger,  but,  in  many  ways,  better.  Knowledge  gained  from   bioterrorism  research  will  improve  public  health.  Stronger  police  and  fire  departments  will  mean  safer   neighborhoods.  Stricter  border  enforcement  will  help  combat  illegal  drugs.  And  as  government  works  to   better  secure  our  homeland,  America  will  continue  to  depend  on  the  eyes  and  ears  of  alert  citizens.   A  few  days  before  Christmas,  an  airline  flight  attendant  spotted  a  passenger  lighting  a  match.  The  crew  and   passengers  quickly  subdued  the  man,  who  had  been  trained  by  al  Qaeda  and  was  armed  with  explosives.   The  people  on  that  plane  were  alert  and,  as  a  result,  likely  saved  nearly  200  lives.   And  tonight  we  welcome   and  thank  flight  attendants  Hermis  Moutardier  and  Christina  Jones. Page  4      Once  we  have  funded  our  national  security  and  our  homeland  security,  the  final  great  priority  of  my  budget   is  economic  security  for  the  American  people.  To  achieve  these  great  national  objectives        to  win  the  war,   protect  the  homeland,  and  revitalize  our  economy        our  budget  will  run  a  deficit  that  will  be  small  and  short     term,  so  long  as  Congress  restrains  spending  and  acts  in  a  fiscally  responsible  manner.  We  have  clear   priorities  and  we  must  act  at  home  with  the  same  purpose  and  resolve  we  have  shown  overseas:  We'll   prevail  in  the  war,  and  we  will  defeat  this  recession.   Americans  who  have  lost  their  jobs  need  our  help  and  I  support  extending  unemployment  benefits  and  direct   assistance  for  health  care  coverage.  Yet,  American  workers  want  more  than  unemployment  checks        they   want  a  steady  paycheck.  When  America  works,  America  prospers,  so  my  economic  security  plan  can  be   summed  up  in  one  word:   jobs.   Good  jobs  begin  with  good  schools,  and  here  we've  made  a  fine  start.  Republicans  and  Democrats  worked   together  to  achieve  historic  education  reform  so  that  no  child  is  left  behind.  I  was  proud  to  work  with   members  of  both  parties:  Chairman  John  Boehner  and  Congressman  George  Miller.  Senator  Judd  Gregg.   And  I  was  so  proud  of  our  work,  I  even  had  nice  things  to  say  about  my  friend,  Ted  Kennedy.  I  know  the   folks  at  the  Crawford  coffee  shop  couldn't  believe  I'd  say  such  a  thing        but  our  work  on  this  bill  shows  what   is  possible  if  we  set  aside  posturing  and  focus  on  results.   There  is  more  to  do.  We  need  to  prepare  our  children  to  read  and  succeed  in  school  with  improved  Head   Start  and  early  childhood  development  programs.  We  must  upgrade  our  teacher  colleges  and  teacher   training  and  launch  a  major  recruiting  drive  with  a  great  goal  for  America:  a  quality  teacher  in  every   classroom.   Good  jobs  also  depend  on  reliable  and  affordable  energy.  This  Congress  must  act  to  encourage   conservation,  promote  technology,  build  infrastructure,  and  it  must  act  to  increase  energy  production  at   home  so  America  is  less  dependent  on  foreign  oil.   Good  jobs  depend  on  expanded  trade.  Selling  into  new  markets  creates  new  jobs,  so  I  ask  Congress  to   finally  approve  trade  promotion  authority.  On  these  two  key  issues,  trade  and  energy,  the  House  of   Representatives  has  acted  to  create  jobs,  and  I  urge  the  Senate  to  pass  this  legislation.   Good  jobs  depend  on  sound  tax  policy.  Last  year,  some  in  this  hall  thought  my  tax  relief  plan  was  too  small     some  thought  it  was  too  big.  But  when  the  checks  arrived  in  the  mail,  most  Americans  thought  tax  relief  was   just  about  right.  Congress  listened  to  the  people  and  responded  by  reducing  tax  rates,  doubling  the  child   credit,  and  ending  the  death  tax.   For  the  sake  of  long  term  growth  and  to  help  Americans  plan  for  the   future,  let's  make  these  tax  cuts  permanent.   The  way  out  of  this  recession,  the  way  to  create  jobs,  is  to  grow  the  economy  by  encouraging  investment  in   factories  and  equipment,  and  by  speeding  up  tax  relief  so  people  have  more  money  to  spend.  For  the  sake   of  American  workers,  let's  pass  a  stimulus  package.   Good  jobs must  be  the  aim  of  welfare  reform. Page  5      As  we  reauthorize  these  important  reforms,  we  must  always  remember  the  goal  is  to  reduce  dependency  on   government  and  offer  every  American  the  dignity  of  a  job.   Americans  know  economic  security  can  vanish  in  an  instant  without  health  security.  I  ask  Congress  to  join   me  this  year  to  enact  a  patients'  bill  of  rights        to  give  uninsured  workers  credits  to  help  buy  health  coverage         to  approve  an  historic  increase  in  the  spending  for  veterans'  health        and  to  give  seniors  a  sound  and   modern  Medicare  system  that  includes  coverage  for  prescription  drugs.   A  good  job  should  lead  to  security  in  retirement.  I  ask  Congress  to  enact  new  safeguards  for  401K  and   pension  plans.  Employees  who  have  worked  hard  and  saved  all  their  lives  should  not  have  to  risk  losing   everything  if  their  company  fails.  Through  stricter  accounting  standards  and  tougher  disclosure   requirements,  corporate  America  must  be  made  more  accountable  to  employees  and  shareholders  and  held   to  the  highest  standards  of  conduct.   Retirement  security  also  depends  upon  keeping  the  commitments  of  Social  Security,  and  we  will.   We  must   make  Social  Security  financially  stable  and  allow  personal  retirement  accounts  for  younger  workers  who   choose  them.   Members,  you  and  I  will  work  together  in  the  months  ahead  on  other  issues:   productive  farm  policy        a   cleaner  environment        broader  home  ownership,  especially  among  minorities        and  ways  to  encourage  the   good  work  of  charities  and  faith  based  groups.  I  ask  you  to  join  me  on  these  important  domestic  issues  in   the  same  spirit  of  cooperation  we've  applied  to  our  war  against  terrorism.   During  these  last  few  months,  I've  been  humbled  and  privileged  to  see  the  true  character  of  this  country  in  a   time  of  testing.  Our  enemies  believed  America  was  weak  and  materialistic,  that  we  would  splinter  in  fear  and   selfishness.  They  were  as  wrong  as  they  are  evil.   The  American  people  have  responded  magnificently,  with  courage  and  compassion,  strength  and  resolve.   As  I  have  met  the  heroes,  hugged  the  families,  and  looked  into  the  tired  faces  of  rescuers,  I  have  stood  in   awe  of  the  American  people.   And  I  hope  you  will  join  me        I  hope  you  will  join  me  in  expressing  thanks  to  one  American  for  the  strength   and  calm  and  comfort  she  brings  to  our  nation  in  crisis,  our  First  Lady,  Laura  Bush.   None  of  us  would  ever  wish  the  evil  that  was  done  on  September  the  11th.  Yet  after  America  was  attacked,   it  was  as  if  our  entire  country  looked  into  a  mirror  and  saw  our  better  selves.  We  were  reminded  that  we  are   citizens,  with  obligations  to  each  other,  to  our  country,  and  to  history.  We  began  to  think  less  of  the  goods   we  can  accumulate,  and  more  about  the  good  we  can  do.   For  too  long  our  culture  has  said,  ""If  it  feels  good,  do  it.""  Now  America  is  embracing  a  new  ethic  and  a  new   creed:  ""Let's  roll.""  In  the  sacrifice  of  soldiers,  the  fierce  brotherhood  of  firefighters,  and  the  bravery  and   generosity  of  ordinary  citizens,  we  have  glimpsed  what  a  new  culture  of  responsibility  could  look  like.  We   want  to  be  a  nation  that  serves  goals  larger  than  self.   We've  been  offered  a  unique  opportunity,  and  we   must  not  let  this  moment  pass. Page  6      My  call  tonight  is  for  every  American  to  commit  at  least  two  years        4,000  hours  over  the  rest  of  your  lifetime         to  the  service  of  your  neighbors  and  your  nation.  Many  are  already  serving,  and  I  thank  you.   If  you  aren't   sure  how  to  help,  I've  got  a  good  place  to  start.  To  sustain  and  extend  the  best  that  has  emerged  in   America,  I  invite  you  to  join  the  new  USA  Freedom  Corps.  The  Freedom  Corps  will  focus  on  three  areas  of   need:  responding  in  case  of  crisis  at  home    rebuilding  our  communities    and  extending  American   compassion  throughout  the  world.   One  purpose  of  the  USA  Freedom  Corps  will  be  homeland  security.  America  needs  retired  doctors  and   nurses  who  can  be  mobilized  in  major  emergencies    volunteers  to  help  police  and  fire  departments     transportation  and  utility  workers  well  trained  in  spotting  danger.   Our  country  also  needs  citizens  working  to  rebuild  our  communities.  We  need  mentors  to  love  children,   especially  children  whose  parents  are  in  prison.   And  we  need  more  talented  teachers  in  troubled  schools.   USA  Freedom  Corps  will  expand  and  improve  the  good  efforts  of  AmeriCorps  and  Senior  Corps  to  recruit   more  than  200,000  new  volunteers.   And  America  needs  citizens  to  extend  the  compassion  of  our  country  to  every  part  of  the  world.   So  we  will   renew  the  promise  of  the  Peace  Corps,  double  its  volunteers  over  the  next  five  years        (applause)        and   ask  it  to  join  a  new  effort  to  encourage  development  and  education  and  opportunity  in  the  Islamic  world.   This  time  of  adversity  offers  a  unique  moment  of  opportunity        a  moment  we  must  seize  to  change  our   culture.   Through  the  gathering  momentum  of  millions  of  acts  of  service  and  decency  and  kindness,  I  know   we  can  overcome  evil  with  greater  good.  And  we  have  a  great  opportunity  during  this  time  of  war  to  lead  the   world  toward  the  values  that  will  bring  lasting  peace.   All  fathers  and  mothers,  in  all  societies,  want  their  children  to  be  educated,  and  live  free  from  poverty  and   violence.  No  people  on  Earth  yearn  to  be  oppressed,  or  aspire  to  servitude,  or  eagerly  await  the  midnight   knock  of  the  secret  police.   If  anyone  doubts  this,  let  them  look  to  Afghanistan,  where  the  Islamic  ""street""  greeted  the  fall  of  tyranny  with   song  and  celebration.  Let  the  skeptics  look  to  Islam's  own  rich  history,  with  its  centuries  of  learning,  and   tolerance  and  progress.  America  will  lead  by  defending  liberty  and  justice  because  they  are  right  and  true   and  unchanging  for  all  people  everywhere.   No  nation  owns  these  aspirations,  and  no  nation  is  exempt  from  them.  We  have  no  intention  of  imposing  our   culture.  But  America  will  always  stand  firm  for  the  non  negotiable  demands  of  human  dignity:   the  rule  of   law    limits  on  the  power  of  the  state    respect  for  women    private  property    free  speech    equal  justice    and   religious  tolerance.   America  will  take  the  side  of  brave  men  and  women  who  advocate  these  values  around  the  world,  including   the  Islamic  world,  because  we  have  a  greater  objective  than  eliminating  threats  and  containing  resentment.   We  seek  a  just  and  peaceful  world  beyond  the  war  on  terror.   In  this  moment  of  opportunity,  a  common  danger  is  erasing  old  rivalries.  America  is  working  with  Russia  and   China  and  India,  in  ways  we  have  never  before,  to  achieve  peace  and  prosperity. Page  7      In  every  region,  free  markets  and  free  trade  and  free  societies  are  proving  their  power  to  lift  lives.   Together   with  friends  and  allies  from  Europe  to  Asia,  and  Africa  to  Latin  America,  we  will  demonstrate  that  the  forces   of  terror  cannot  stop  the  momentum  of  freedom.   The  last  time  I  spoke  here,  I  expressed  the  hope  that  life  would  return  to  normal.  In  some  ways,  it  has.  In   others,  it  never  will.   Those  of  us  who  have  lived  through  these  challenging  times  have  been  changed  by   them.  We've  come  to  know  truths  that  we  will  never  question:  evil  is  real,  and  it  must  be  opposed.  Beyond   all  differences  of  race  or  creed,  we  are  one  country,  mourning  together  and  facing  danger  together.  Deep  in   the  American  character,  there  is  honor,  and  it  is  stronger  than  cynicism.   And  many  have  discovered  again   that  even  in  tragedy        especially  in  tragedy        God  is  near.   In  a  single  instant,  we  realized  that  this  will  be  a  decisive  decade  in  the  history  of  liberty,  that  we've  been   called  to  a  unique  role  in  human  events.  Rarely  has  the  world  faced  a  choice  more  clear  or  consequential.   Our  enemies  send  other  people's  children  on  missions  of  suicide  and  murder.  They  embrace  tyranny  and   death  as  a  cause  and  a  creed.  We  stand  for  a  different  choice,  made  long  ago,  on  the  day  of  our   founding. We  affirm  it  again  today. We  choose  freedom  and  the  dignity  of  every  life.   Steadfast  in  our  purpose,  we  now  press  on.  We  have  known  freedom's  price.  We  have  shown  freedom's   power.  And  in  this  great  conflict,  my  fellow  Americans,  we  will  see  freedom's  victory.   Thank  you  all.  May  God  bless. Page  8  ",bush
"Well, thank you very much for that warm welcome. I am so grateful for the Commonwealth Club and the Churchill Club for inviting me here. I appreciate you all coming, and I appreciateyour hospitality. I want to thank Dr. Gloria Duffy for her generous introduction and for her invitation. I want to thank Silvia Fernandez, who's the President of the Churchill Club, for joining the Commonwealth Club to host this event. I want to thank all the elected officials who are here. Iwant to thank my fellow citizens for coming. Whenever I visit California, I'm impressed by the beauty of this state and by the spirit of the people. Because of its size, the health of the California economy influences every American. And California has got a culture of optimism and energy that touches all of us, as well. This isa vital and a vibrant place. And I'm glad to be back. The last time I visited San Jose, Silicon Valley was still in an economic boom, and America was at peace. For many in this valley, and across our country, those times are a world away. After a recession made worse by a national emergency, we have seen some good news. Our economy is beginning to grow. Just last week, we had the good news about strong growth inthe first quarter. Yet this vital region reminds us that a lot of work remains to be done. Business investment and job creation are not what they should be. We cannot be content with one quarter's news. We cannot be complacent. My attitude is that we'll let the statisticians talk about the numbers. But so long as somebody who wants to work can't find work, that's aproblem for America. We have a great task ahead of us. We must turn our short-term recovery into long-lasting expansion that reaches every part of our country. Our economy grows when trade barriers fall. I ask the Senate to join the United States House of Representatives in giving me what'scalled trade promotion authority. It's important to be a confident country. And I'm confident in the ability of American entrepreneurs and producers to compete in the world. I'm confident that our farmers and ranchers can compete in the world. And I know American technology companies are the bestin the world. And we must open new markets so they can sell to the world. Our economy grows when the tax burden goes down, and stays down. Much of the growth we have seen this quarter is the result of consumer spending, fueled by well-timed tax deductions. (Laughter.) To encourage growth in job creation, we must protect the lower tax rates we've enacted, and we must make them permanent. And to make sure there is economic vitality around our country, our government must control its appetite for excessivespending. Our economy grows entrepreneurs are rewarded for their success, not hounded by regulations and needless litigation. We must enact reforms that free entrepreneurs from pointless regulation and endless litigation, and to restore trust in our economy. Corporate leaders must be held to the highest ethical standards. And, as your state knows, our economy grows whenwe have steady, stable and affordable sources of energy. In Washington, we must adopt -- finally adopt -- a comprehensive strategy to conserve more, to produce more, and to deliver the energy that keeps our economy running. Both Houses have passed an energy -- passed energy legislation. I expect them to get a bill to my desk soon for the good of American economy and American jobs. By acting in the above way, we confirm that the role of government is not to create wealth; the role of government is tocreate the conditions for economic growth. Since I was last here, America has also accepted a great challenge in the world: to wage a relentless and systematic campaign against global terror. The security of the American people is the central commitment of the American government. We are in for a long and difficult war.It will be conducted on many fronts. But as long as it takes, we will prevail. In the first phase of our military operation, American and coalition forces have liberated -- have liberated -- the people of Afghanistan from a barbaric regime. Our Armed Forces performed with skill and success and honor. A regime has fallen. Terrorists in that country are now scattered, and the children of Afghanistan have returned to school, boys and girls. Our work in that country is not over. We are helping the Afghan people to rebuild their nation. And in every cave, in every dark corner of that country, we will hunt down the killers and bringthem to justice. We have entered the next phase of the war, with a sustained international effort, to rout out terrorists in other countries, and deny al Qaeda the chance to regroup in other places. Across the world, governments have heard this message: You're either with us, or you're with theterrorists. And for the long-term security of America and civilization itself, we must confront the great threat of biological and chemical and nuclear weapons in the hands of terrorists or hostile regimes. We will not allow the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten America or ourfriends and allies with the world's most destructive weapons. History has called us to these responsibilities, and we accept them. America has always had a special mission to defend justice and advance freedom around the world. Whatever the difficulties ahead, we are confident about the outcome of this struggle. Tyranny and terror and lawless violence will not decide the world's future. As Ronald Reagan said. and as everygeneration of Americans has believed, the future belongs to the free. In a time of war, we reassert the essential values and beliefs of our country. In the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln pointed toward a new birth of freedom. Leading America into global war, Franklin D. Roosevelt defined the four freedoms: freedom of speech and religion, freedom from fear and want. Whenever America fights for the security of our country, we also fight for the values of our country. In our time, we will defend the land we love and we will act on theideals that gave it birth. In America, we've not always lived up to our ideals, yet we always reached for them. We believe that everyone deserves a chance, that everyone has value, that no insignificant person was ever born. We believe that all are diminished when any are hopeless. We are one people,committed to building a single nation of justice and opportunity. America rejects bigotry. We reject every act of hatred against people of Arab background or Muslim faith. We reject the ancient evil of anti-Semitism, whether it is practiced by the killersof Daniel Pearl, or by those who burn synagogues in France. America values and welcomes peaceful people of all faiths -- Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Sikh, Hindu and many others. Every faith is practiced and protected here, because we are one country. Every immigrant can be fully and equally American because we're one country. Raceand color should not divide us, because America is one country. These American ideals of opportunity and equality come to us across the generations. And they have attracted millions from across the world. Yet there are young Americans growing up here, under this flag, who doubt the promise and justice of our country. They live in neighborhoods occupied by gangs and ruled by fear. They are entitled by law to an education, yet do not receive an education. They hear talk of opportunity and see little evidence ofopportunity around them. Every American must believe in the promise of America. And to reach this noble, necessary goal, there is a role for government. America doesn't need more big government, and we've learned that more money is not always the answer. If a program is failing to serve people, it makes little difference if we spend twice as much or half as much. The measure of truecompassion is results. Yet we cannot have an indifferent government either. We are a generous and caring people. We don't believe in a sink-or-swim society. The policies of our government must heed the universal call of all faiths to love a neighbor as we would want to be loved ourselves. We need a different approach than either big government or indifferent government. We need a government that is focused, effective, and close to the people; a government that does a fewthings, and does them well. Government cannot solve every problem, but it can encourage people and communities to help themselves and to help one another. Often the truest kind of compassion is to help citizens build lives of their own. I call my philosophy and approach ""compassionate conservatism."" It is compassionate to actively help our fellow citizens in need. It is conservative to insist on responsibility and on results. And with this hopeful approach, we canmake a real difference in people's lives. Compassionate conservatism places great hope and confidence in public education. Our economy depends on higher and higher skills, requiring every American to have the basictools of learning. Every public school should be the path of upward mobility. Yet, sadly enough, many are the dead-end of dreams. Public schools are some of the most important institutions of democracy. They take children of every background, from every part of the world, and prepare them for the obligations and opportunities of a free society. Public schools are Americans great hope, and making them work for every child is America's greatduty. The new education reforms we have passed in Washington give the federal government a new role in public education. Schools must meet new and high standards of performance in reading and math that will be proven on tests and posted on the Internet for parents and everyone to see. And we're giving local schools and teachers unprecedented freedom and resources andtraining to meet these goals. It is conservative to let local communities chart their own path to excellence. It is compassionate to insist that every child learns, so that no child is left behind. By insisting on results, and challenging failure where we find it, we'll make an incredible difference in thelives of every child in America. Compassionate conservatism offers a new vision for fighting poverty in America. For decades, our nation has devoted enormous resources to helping the poor, with some great successes to show for it: basic medical care for those in need, a better life for elderly Americans. However,for millions of younger Americans, welfare became a static and destructive way of life. In 1996, we began transforming welfare with time limits and job training and work requirements. And the nation's welfare rolls have been cut by more than half. But even moreimportantly, many lives have been dramatically improved. One former welfare recipient here in California, happened to be a mother of a chronically-ill child and the victim of domestic violence, describes her experience upon leaving welfare. Shesaid, ""I feel like an adult again. I have my dignity back."" We need to continue to fully transform welfare in America. As Congress takes up welfare reform again in the coming weeks, we must strengthen the work requirements that prevent dependency and despair. Millions of Americans once on welfare are finding that a job is more than a source of income. It is a source of dignity. And by helping people find work, by helpingthem prepare for work, we practice compassion. Welfare reform must also, wherever possible, encourage the commitments of family. Not every child has two devoted parents at home -- I understand that. And not every marriagecan, or should be saved. But the evidence shows that strong marriages are good for children. When a couple on welfare wants to break bad patterns and start or strengthen a marriage, we should help local groups give them counseling that teaches commitment and respect. Byencouraging family, we practice compassion. In overcoming poverty and dependence, we must also promote the work of charities and community groups and faith-based institutions. These organizations, such as shelters for battered women or mentoring programs for fatherless children or drug treatment centers, inspire hope in a way that government never can. Often, they inspire life-changing faith in away that government never should. Our government should view the good Americans that work in faith-based charities as partners, not rivals. We must provide new incentives for charitable giving and, when it comes to providing federal resources to effective programs, we should not discriminate againstprivate and religious groups. I urge the Senate to pass the faith-based initiative for the good of America. It is compassionate to aggressively fight poverty in America. It is conservative to encourage work and community spirit and responsibility and the values that often come from faith. And with this approach, we can change lives one soul at a time, and make a real difference in the livesof our citizens. The same principles of compassion and responsibility apply when America offers assistance to other nations. Nearly half of the world's people still live on less than $2 a day. When we help them, we show our values, our belief in universal human dignity. We serve our interests and gain economic partners. And by helping the developing nations of the world, we offer analternative to resentment and conflict and terror. Yet the old way of pouring vast amounts of money into development aid without any concern for results has failed, often leaving behind misery and poverty and corruption. America's offering a new compact for global development. Greater aid contributions from America mustbe and will be linked to greater responsibility from developing nations. I have proposed a 50-percent increase in our core development assistance over the next three budget years. Money that will be placed in a new Millennium Challenge Account. At the end of this three-year period, the level of our annual development assistance will be $5 billion higherthan current levels. This is a record amount of spending. And in return for these funds, we expect nations to rout out corruption, to open their markets, to respect human rights, and to adhere to the rule of law. And these are the keys to progress in any nation, and they will be the conditions for anynew American aid. It is compassionate to increase our international aid. It is conservative to require the hard reforms that lead to prosperity and independence. And with this approach, we'll make a realdifference in the lives of people around the world. Compassionate conservatism guides my administration in many other areas. Our health care policies must help low-income Americans to buy health insurance they choose, they own and they control. Our environmental policy set high standards for stewardship, while allowing local cooperation and innovation to meet those standards. Our housing programs moved beyond rental assistance to the pride and stability of home ownership. Our reforms in Social Security must allow and encourage and help working Americans to build up their own asset base andachieve independence for their retirement years. All of these policies and all of these areas serve the same vision. We are using an active government to promote self-government. We're encouraging individuals and communities and families to take more and more responsibility for themselves, for their neighbors, for our nation. The aim of these policies is not to spend more money or spend less money; it is tospend on what works. The measure of compassion is more than good intentions, it is good results. Sympathy is not enough. We need solutions in America, and we know where solutions are found. When schools are teaching, when families are strong, when neighbors look after their neighbors, when our people have the tools and the skills and the resources they need to improve their lives, thereis no problem that cannot be solved in America. By being involved and by taking responsibility upon ourselves, we gain something else, as well: We contribute to the life of our country. We become more than taxpayers and occasional voters, we become citizens. Citizens, not spectators. Citizens who hear the call of duty, who stand up for their beliefs, who care for their families, who control their lives, and who treat their neighbors with respect and compassion. We discover a satisfaction that is only found inservice, and we show our gratitude to America and to those who came before us. In the last seven months, we've been tested, and the struggle of our time has revealed the spirit of our people. Since September the 11th, we have been the kind of nation our founders had in mind, a nation of strong and confident and self-governing people. And we've been the kind of nation our fathers and mothers defended in World War II; a great and diverse country,united by common dangers and by common resolve. We in our time will defend our nation, and we will deliver our nation's promise to all who seek it. In our war on terror, we are showing the world the strength of our country, and by ourunity and tolerance and compassion, we will show the world the soul of our country. May God bless America.",bush
"For  too  long,  the  citizens  of  the  Middle  East  have  lived  in  the  midst  of  death  and  fear.  The  hatred  of  a  few   holds  the  hopes  of  many  hostage.  The  forces  of  extremism  and  terror  are  attempting  to  kill  progress  and   peace  by  killing  the  innocent.  And  this  casts  a  dark  shadow  over  an  entire  region.  For  the  sake  of  all   humanity,  things  must  change  in  the  Middle  East.   It  is  untenable  for  Israeli  citizens  to  live  in  terror.  It  is  untenable  for  Palestinians  to  live  in  squalor  and   occupation.  And  the  current  situation  offers  no  prospect  that  life  will  improve.  Israeli  citizens  will  continue  to   be  victimized  by  terrorists,  and  so  Israel  will  continue  to  defend  herself.   In  the  situation  the  Palestinian  people  will  grow  more  and  more  miserable.  My  vision  is  two  states,  living  side   by  side  in  peace  and  security.  There  is  simply  no  way  to  achieve  that  peace  until  all  parties  fight  terror.  Yet,   at  this  critical  moment,  if  all  parties  will  break  with  the  past  and  set  out  on  a  new  path,  we  can  overcome  the   darkness  with  the  light  of  hope.  Peace  requires  a  new  and  different  Palestinian  leadership,  so  that  a   Palestinian  state  can  be  born.   I  call  on  the  Palestinian  people  to  elect  new  leaders,  leaders  not  compromised  by  terror.  I  call  upon  them  to   build  a  practicing  democracy,  based  on  tolerance  and  liberty.  If  the  Palestinian  people  actively  pursue  these   goals,  America  and  the  world  will  actively  support  their  efforts.  If  the  Palestinian  people  meet  these  goals,   they  will  be  able  to  reach  agreement  with  Israel  and  Egypt  and  Jordan  on  security  and  other  arrangements   for  independence.   And  when  the  Palestinian  people  have  new  leaders,  new  institutions  and  new  security  arrangements  with   their  neighbors,  the  United  States  of  America  will  support  the  creation  of  a  Palestinian  state  whose  borders   and  certain  aspects  of  its  sovereignty  will  be  provisional  until  resolved  as  part  of  a  final  settlement  in  the   Middle  East.    In  the  work  ahead,  we  all  have  responsibilities.  The  Palestinian  people  are  gifted  and  capable,  and  I  am   confident  they  can  achieve  a  new  birth  for  their  nation.  A  Palestinian  state  will  never  be  created  by  terror        it   will  be  built  through  reform.  And  reform  must  be  more  than  cosmetic  change,  or  veiled  attempt  to  preserve   the  status  quo.  True  reform  will  require  entirely  new  political  and  economic  institutions,  based  on   democracy,  market  economics  and  action  against  terrorism.   Today,  the  elected  Palestinian  legislature  has  no  authority,  and  power  is  concentrated  in  the  hands  of  an   unaccountable  few.  A  Palestinian  state  can  only  serve  its  citizens  with  a  new  constitution  which  separates   the  powers  of  government.  The  Palestinian  parliament  should  have  the  full  authority  of  a  legislative  body.   Local  officials  and  government  ministers  need  authority  of  their  own  and  the  independence  to  govern   effectively.   The  United  States,  along  with  the  European  Union  and  Arab  states,  will  work  with  Palestinian  leaders  to   create  a  new  constitutional  framework,  and  a  working  democracy  for  the  Palestinian  people.  And  the  United   States,  along  with  others  in  the  international  community  will  help  the  Palestinians  organize  and  monitor  fair,   multi  party  local  elections  by  the  end  of  the  year,  with  national  elections  to  follow.   Today,  the  Palestinian  people  live  in  economic  stagnation,  made  worse  by  official  corruption.  A  Palestinian   state  will  require  a  vibrant  economy,  where  honest  enterprise  is  encouraged  by  honest  government.  The   United  States,  the  international  donor  community  and  the  World  Bank  stand  ready  to  work  with  Palestinians   on  a  major  project  of  economic  reform  and  development.  The  United  States,  the  EU,  the  World  Bank,  the   International  Monetary  Fund  are  willing  to  oversee  reforms  in  Palestinian  finances,  encouraging   transparency  and  independent  auditing.   And  the  United  States,  along  with  our  partners  in  the  developed  world,  will  increase  our  humanitarian   assistance  to  relieve  Palestinian  suffering.  Today,  the  Palestinian  people  lack  effective  courts  of  law  and   have  no  means  to  defend  and  vindicate  their  rights.  A  Palestinian  state  will  require  a  system  of  reliable   justice  to  punish  those  who  prey  on  the  innocent.  The  United  States  and  members  of  the  international   community  stand  ready  to  work  with  Palestinian  leaders  to  establish  finance        establish  finance  and  monitor   a  truly  independent  judiciary.   Today,  Palestinian  authorities  are  encouraging,  not  opposing,  terrorism.  This  is  unacceptable.  And  the   United  States  will  not  support  the  establishment  of  a  Palestinian  state  until  its  leaders  engage  in  a  sustained   fight  against  the  terrorists  and  dismantle  their  infrastructure.  This  will  require  an  externally  supervised  effort   to  rebuild  and  reform  the  Palestinian  security  services.  The  security  system  must  have  clear  lines  of   authority  and  accountability  and  a  unified  chain  of  command.   America  is  pursuing  this  reform  along  with  key  regional  states.  The  world  is  prepared  to  help,  yet  ultimately   these  steps  toward  statehood  depend  on  the  Palestinian  people  and  their  leaders.  If  they  energetically  take   the  path  of  reform,  the  rewards  can  come  quickly.  If  Palestinians  embrace  democracy,  confront  corruption   and  firmly  reject  terror,  they  can  count  on  American  support  for  the  creation  of  a  provisional  state  of   Palestine.    With  a  dedicated  effort,  this  state  could  rise  rapidly,  as  it  comes  to  terms  with  Israel,  Egypt  and  Jordan  on   practical  issues,  such  as  security.  The  final  borders,  the  capital  and  other  aspects  of  this  state's  sovereignty   will  be  negotiated  between  the  parties,  as  part  of  a  final  settlement.  Arab  states  have  offered  their  help  in   this  process,  and  their  help  is  needed.   I've  said  in  the  past  that  nations  are  either  with  us  or  against  us  in  the  war  on  terror.  To  be  counted  on  the   side  of  peace,  nations  must  act.  Every  leader  actually  committed  to  peace  will  end  incitement  to  violence  in   official  media,  and  publicly  denounce  homicide  bombings.  Every  nation  actually  committed  to  peace  will  stop   the  flow  of  money,  equipment  and  recruits  to  terrorist  groups  seeking  the  destruction  of  Israel        including   Hamas,  Islamic  Jihad,  and  Hezbollah.  Every  nation  actually  committed  to  peace  must  block  the  shipment  of   Iranian  supplies  to  these  groups,  and  oppose  regimes  that  promote  terror,  like  Iraq.  And  Syria  must  choose   the  right  side  in  the  war  on  terror  by  closing  terrorist  camps  and  expelling  terrorist  organizations.   Leaders  who  want  to  be  included  in  the  peace  process  must  show  by  their  deeds  an  undivided  support  for   peace.  And  as  we  move  toward  a  peaceful  solution,  Arab  states  will  be  expected  to  build  closer  ties  of   diplomacy  and  commerce  with  Israel,  leading  to  full  normalization  of  relations  between  Israel  and  the  entire   Arab  world.   Israel  also  has  a  large  stake  in  the  success  of  a  democratic  Palestine.  Permanent  occupation  threatens   Israel's  identity  and  democracy.  A  stable,  peaceful  Palestinian  state  is  necessary  to  achieve  the  security  that   Israel  longs  for.  So  I  challenge  Israel  to  take  concrete  steps  to  support  the  emergence  of  a  viable,  credible   Palestinian  state.   As  we  make  progress  towards  security,  Israel  forces  need  to  withdraw  fully  to  positions  they  held  prior  to   September  28,  2000.  And  consistent  with  the  recommendations  of  the  Mitchell  Committee,  Israeli  settlement   activity  in  the  occupied  territories  must  stop.   The  Palestinian  economy  must  be  allowed  to  develop.  As  violence  subsides,  freedom  of  movement  should   be  restored,  permitting  innocent  Palestinians  to  resume  work  and  normal  life.  Palestinian  legislators  and   officials,  humanitarian  and  international  workers,  must  be  allowed  to  go  about  the  business  of  building  a   better  future.  And  Israel  should  release  frozen  Palestinian  revenues  into  honest,  accountable  hands.   I've  asked  Secretary  Powell  to  work  intensively  with  Middle  Eastern  and  international  leaders  to  realize  the   vision  of  a  Palestinian  state,  focusing  them  on  a  comprehensive  plan  to  support  Palestinian  reform  and   institution  building.   Ultimately,  Israelis  and  Palestinians  must  address  the  core  issues  that  divide  them  if  there  is  to  be  a  real   peace,  resolving  all  claims  and  ending  the  conflict  between  them.  This  means  that  the  Israeli  occupation  that   began  in  1967  will  be  ended  through  a  settlement  negotiated  between  the  parties,  based  on  U.N.   Resolutions  242  and  338,  with  Israeli  withdrawal  to  secure  and  recognize  borders.   We  must  also  resolve  questions  concerning  Jerusalem,  the  plight  and  future  of  Palestinian  refugees,  and  a   final  peace  between  Israel  and  Lebanon,  and  Israel  and  a  Syria  that  supports  peace  and  fights  terror.    All  who  are  familiar  with  the  history  of  the  Middle  East  realize  that  there  may  be  setbacks  in  this  process.   Trained  and  determined  killers,  as  we  have  seen,  want  to  stop  it.  Yet  the  Egyptian  and  Jordanian  peace   treaties  with  Israel  remind  us  that  with  determined  and  responsible  leadership  progress  can  come  quickly.   As  new  Palestinian  institutions  and  new  leaders  emerge,  demonstrating  real  performance  on  security  and   reform,  I  expect  Israel  to  respond  and  work  toward  a  final  status  agreement.  With  intensive  effort  by  all,  this   agreement  could  be  reached  within  three  years  from  now.  And  I  and  my  country  will  actively  lead  toward   that  goal.   I  can  understand  the  deep  anger  and  anguish  of  the  Israeli  people.  You've  lived  too  long  with  fear  and   funerals,  having  to  avoid  markets  and  public  transportation,  and  forced  to  put  armed  guards  in  kindergarten   classrooms.  The  Palestinian  Authority  has  rejected  your  offer  at  hand,  and  trafficked  with  terrorists.  You   have  a  right  to  a  normal  life    you  have  a  right  to  security    and  I  deeply  believe  that  you  need  a  reformed,   responsible  Palestinian  partner  to  achieve  that  security.   I  can  understand  the  deep  anger  and  despair  of  the  Palestinian  people.  For  decades  you've  been  treated  as   pawns  in  the  Middle  East  conflict.  Your  interests  have  been  held  hostage  to  a  comprehensive  peace   agreement  that  never  seems  to  come,  as  your  lives  get  worse  year  by  year.  You  deserve  democracy  and   the  rule  of  law.  You  deserve  an  open  society  and  a  thriving  economy.  You  deserve  a  life  of  hope  for  your   children.  An  end  to  occupation  and  a  peaceful  democratic  Palestinian  state  may  seem  distant,  but  America   and  our  partners  throughout  the  world  stand  ready  to  help,  help  you  make  them  possible  as  soon  as   possible.   If  liberty  can  blossom  in  the  rocky  soil  of  the  West  Bank  and  Gaza,  it  will  inspire  millions  of  men  and  women   around  the  globe  who  are  equally  weary  of  poverty  and  oppression,  equally  entitled  to  the  benefits  of   democratic  government.   I  have  a  hope  for  the  people  of  Muslim  countries.  Your  commitments  to  morality,  and  learning,  and  tolerance   led  to  great  historical  achievements.  And  those  values  are  alive  in  the  Islamic  world  today.  You  have  a  rich   culture,  and  you  share  the  aspirations  of  men  and  women  in  every  culture.  Prosperity  and  freedom  and   dignity  are  not  just  American  hopes,  or  Western  hopes.  They  are  universal,  human  hopes.  And  even  in  the   violence  and  turmoil  of  the  Middle  East,  America  believes  those  hopes  have  the  power  to  transform  lives   and  nations.   This  moment  is  both  an  opportunity  and  a  test  for  all  parties  in  the  Middle  East:  an  opportunity  to  lay  the   foundations  for  future  peace    a  test  to  show  who  is  serious  about  peace  and  who  is  not.  The  choice  here  is   stark  and  simple.  The  Bible  says,  ""I  have  set  before  you  life  and  death    therefore,  choose  life.""  The  time  has   arrived  for  everyone  in  this  conflict  to  choose  peace,  and  hope,  and  life.   Thank  you  very  much.",bush
"Yesterday we remembered the innocent lives taken that terrible morning. Today we turn tothe urgent duty of protecting other lives without illusion and without fear. We've accomplished much in the last year in Afghanistan and beyond. We have much yet todo in Afghanistan and beyond. Many nations represented here have joined in the fight againstglobal terror and the people of the United States are grateful. The United Nations was born in the hope that survived a world war, the hope of a worldmoving toward justice, escaping old patterns of conflict and fear. The founding membersresolved that the peace of the world must never again be destroyed by the will andwickedness of any man. We created a United Nations Security Council so that, unlike the League of Nations, ourdeliberations would be more than talk, our resolutions would be more than wishes. Aftergenerations of deceitful dictators and broken treaties and squandered lives, we've dedicatedourselves to standards of human dignity shared by all and to a system of security defended byall. Today, these standards and this security are challenged. Our commitment to human dignity is challenged by persistent poverty and raging disease. Thesuffering is great. And our responsibilities are clear. The United States is joining with theworld to supply aid where it reaches people and lifts up lives, to extend trade and theprosperity it brings, and to bring medical care where it is desperately needed. As a symbol ofour commitment to human dignity. The United States will return to UNESCO. This organization has been reformed, and America will participate fully in its mission toadvance human rights and tolerance and learning. Our common security is challenged byregional conflicts, ethnic and religious strife that is ancient, but not inevitable. In the Middle East there can be no peace for either side without freedom for both sides. America stands committed to an independent and democratic Palestine, living side-by-sidewith Israel in peace and security. Like all other people, Palestinians deserve a governmentthat serves their interests and listens to their voices. My nation will continue to encourage allparties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and comprehensive settlement tothe conflict. Above all, our principles and our security are challenged today by outlaw groups and regimesthat accept no law of morality and have no limit to their violent ambitions. In the attacks onAmerica a year ago, we saw the destructive intentions of our enemies. This threat hides withinmany nations, including my own. In cells, in camps, terrorists are plotting further destruction and building new bases for theirwar against civilization. And our greatest fear is that terrorists will find a shortcut to their madambitions when an outlaw regime supplies them with the technologies to kill on a massivescale. In one place and one regime, we find all these dangers in their most lethal andaggressive forms, exactly the kind of aggressive threat the United Nations was born toconfront. Twelve years ago, Iraq invaded Kuwait without provocation. And the regime's forces werepoised to continue their march to seize other countries and their resources. Had SaddamHussein been appeased instead of stopped, he would have endangered the peace and stabilityof the world. Yet this aggression was stopped by the might of coalition forces and the will ofthe United Nations. To suspend hostilities, to spare himself, Iraq's dictator accepted a series of commitments. Theterms were clear to him and to all, and he agreed to prove he is complying with every one ofthose obligations. He has proven instead only his contempt for the United Nations and for allhis pledges. By breaking every pledge, by his deceptions and by his cruelties, Saddam Husseinhas made the case against himself. In 1991, Security Council Resolution 688 demanded that the Iraqi regime cease at once therepression of its own people, including the systematic repression of minorities, which thecouncil said threatened international peace and security in the region. This demand goesignored. Last year, the U.N. Commission on Human Rights found that Iraq continues to commitextremely grave violations of human rights and that the regime's repression is all-pervasive. Tens of thousands of political opponents and ordinary citizens have been subjected toarbitrary arrest and imprisonment, summary execution and torture by beating and burning,electric shock, starvation, mutilation and rape. Wives are tortured in front of their husbands; children in the presence of their parents; and allof these horrors concealed from the world by the apparatus of a totalitarian state. In 1991, the U.N. Security Council, through Resolutions 686 and 687, demanded that Iraqreturn all prisoners from Kuwait and other lands. Iraq's regime agreed. It broke this promise. Last year, the Secretary General's high-level coordinator for this issue reported that Kuwaiti,Saudi, Indian, Syrian, Lebanese, Iranian, Egyptian, Bahraini and Armeni nationals remainunaccounted for; more than 600 people. One American pilot is among them. In 1991, the U.N. Security Council through Resolution 687 demanded that Iraq renounce allinvolvement with terrorism and permit no terrorist organizations to operate in Iraq. Iraq's regime agreed that broke this promise. In violation of Security Council Resolution 1373, Iraq continues to shelter and support terroristorganizations that direct violence against Iran, Israel and Western governments. Iraqidissidents abroad are targeted for murder. In 1993, Iraq attempted to assassinate the Amir of Kuwait and a former American president.Iraq's government openly praised the attacks of September 11. And Al Qaeda terroristsescaped from Afghanistan and are known to be in Iraq. In 1991, the Iraqi regime agreed destroy and stop developing all weapons of mass destructionand long range missiles and to prove to the world it has done so by complying with rigorousinspections. Iraq has broken every aspect of this fundamental pledge. From 1991 to 1995, the Iraqi regime said it had no biological weapons. After a senior officialin its weapons program defected and exposed this lie, the regime admitted to producing tensof thousands of liters of anthrax and other deadly biological agents for use with scudwarheads, aerial bombs and aircraft spray tanks. U.N. inspectors believe Iraq has produced two to four times the amount of biological agents itdeclared and has failed to account for more than three metric tons of material that could beused to produce biological weapons. Right now, Iraq is expanding and improving facilities thatwere used for the production of biological weapons. United Nations' inspections also reviewed that Iraq like maintains stockpiles of VX, mustardand other chemical agents, and that the regime is rebuilding and expanding facilities capableof producing chemical weapons. And in 1995, after four years of deception, Iraq finally admitted it had a crash nuclearweapons program prior to the Gulf War. We know now, were it not for that war, the regime in Iraq would likely have possessed anuclear weapon no later than 1993. Today, Iraq continues to withhold important information about its nuclear program, weaponsdesign, procurement logs, experiment data, and accounting of nuclear materials anddocumentation of foreign assistance. Iraq employs capable nuclear scientists and technicians.It retains physical infrastructure needed to build a nuclear weapon. Iraq has made several attempts to buy high-strength aluminum tubes used to enrich uraniumfor a nuclear weapon. Should Iraq acquire fissile material, it would be able to build a nuclearweapon within a year. And Iraq's state-controlled media has reported numerous meetings between Saddam Husseinand his nuclear scientists, leaving little doubt about his continued appetite for these weapons. Iraq also possesses a force of SCUD type missiles with ranges beyond the 150 kilometerspermitted by the U.N. Work at testing and production facilities shows that Iraq is buildingmore long range missiles that can inflict mass death throughout the region. In 1990, after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the world imposed economic sanctions on Iraq. Thosesanctions were maintained after the war to compel the regime's compliance with SecurityCouncil Resolutions. In time, Iraq was allowed to use oil revenues to buy food. Saddam Hussein has subverted thisprogram, working around the sanctions to buy missile technology and military materials. Heblames the suffering of Iraq's people on the United Nations, even as he uses his oil wealth tobuild lavish palaces for himself and to buy arms for his country. By refusing to comply with his own agreements, he bears full guilt for the hunger and miseryof innocent Iraqi citizens. In 1991, Iraq promised U.N. inspectors immediate and unrestrictedaccess to verify Iraq's commitment to rid itself of weapons of mass destruction and long rangemissiles. Iraq broke this promise, spending seven years deceiving, evading and harassing U.N.inspectors before ceasing cooperation entirely. Just months after the 1991 cease-fire, the Security Council twice renewed its demand that theIraqi regime cooperate fully with inspectors, condemning Iraq's serious violations of itsobligations. The Security Council again renewed that demand in 1994, and twice more in 1996, deploringIraq's clear violations of its obligations. The Security Council renewed its demand three moretimes in 1997, citing flagrant violations, and three more times in 1998, calling Iraq's behaviortotally unacceptable. And in 1999, the demand was renewed yet again. As we meet today, it's been almost four years since the last U.N. inspector set foot in Iraq --four years for the Iraqi regime to plan and to build and to test behind the cloak of secrecy. Weknow that Saddam Hussein pursued weapons of mass murder even when inspectors were inhis country. Are we to assume that he stopped when they left? The history, the logic and the facts lead to one conclusion: Saddam Hussein regime is a graveand gathering danger. To suggest otherwise is to hope against the evidence. To assume this regime's good faith is tobet the lives of millions and the peace of the world in a reckless gamble, and this is a risk wemust not take. Delegates to the General Assembly, we have been more than patient. We've tried sanctions.We've tried the carrot of oil for food and the stick of coalition military strikes. But SaddamHussein has defied all these efforts and continues to develop weapons of mass destruction. The first time we may be completely certain he has nuclear weapons is when, God forbid, heuses one. We owe it to all our citizens to do everything in our power to prevent that day fromcoming. The conduct of the Iraqi regime is a threat to the authority of the United Nations and a threatto peace. Iraq has answered a decade of U.N. demands with a decade of defiance. All theworld now faces a test, and the United Nations a difficult and defining moment. Are Security Council resolutions to be honored and enforced or cast aside withoutconsequence? Will the United Nations serve the purpose of its founding or will it be irrelevant? The United States help found the United Nations. We want the United Nations to be effectiveand respectful and successful. We want the resolutions of the world's most importantmultilateral body to be enforced. And right now those resolutions are being unilaterallysubverted by the Iraqi regime. Our partnership of nations can meet the test before us by making clear what we now expectof the Iraqi regime. If the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will immediately and unconditionally forswear, disclose andremove or destroy all weapons of mass destruction, long-range missiles and all relatedmaterial. If the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will immediately end all support for terrorism and act tosuppress it -- as all states are required to do by U.N. Security Council resolutions. If the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will cease persecution of its civilian population, includingShi'a, Sunnis, Kurds, Turkemens and others -- again, as required by Security Councilresolutions. If the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will release or account for all Gulf War personnel whosefate is still unknown. It will return the remains of any who are deceased, return stolen property, accept liability forlosses resulting from the invasion of Kuwait and fully cooperate with international efforts toresolve these issues as required by Security Council resolutions. If the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will immediately end all illicit trade outside the oil-for-foodprogram. It will accept U.N. administration of funds from that program to ensure that themoney is used fairly and promptly for the benefit of the Iraqi people. If all these steps are taken, it will signal a new openness and accountability in Iraq and itcould open the prospect of the United Nations helping to build a government that representsall Iraqis, a government based on respect for human rights, economic liberty andinternationally supervised elections. The United States has no quarrel with the Iraqi people. They've suffered too long in silentcaptivity. Liberty for the Iraqi people is a great moral cause and a great strategic goal. The people of Iraq deserve it. The security of all nations requires it. Free societies do notintimidate through cruelty and conquest. And open societies do not threaten the world withmass murder. The United States supports political and economic liberty in a unified Iraq. We can harbor no illusions, and that's important today to remember. Saddam Husseinattacked Iran in 1980 and Kuwait in 1990. He's fired ballistic missiles at Iran and SaudiArabia, Bahrain and Israel. His regime once ordered the killing of every person between theages of 15 and 70 in certain Kurdish villages in northern Iraq. He has gassed many Iraniansand 40 Iraqi villages. My nation will work with the U.N. Security Council to meet our common challenge. If Iraq'sregime defies us again, the world must move deliberately, decisively to hold Iraq to account.We will work with the U.N. Security Council for the necessary resolutions. But the purposes of the United States should not be doubted. The Security Council resolutionswill be enforced, the just demands of peace and security will be met or action will beunavoidable and a regime that has lost its legitimacy will also lose its power. Events can turn in one of two ways. If we fail to act in the face of danger, the people of Iraqwill continue to live in brutal submission. The regime will have new power to bully anddominate and conquer its neighbors, condemning the Middle East to more years of bloodshedand fear. The regime will remain unstable -- the region will remain unstable, with little hope offreedom and isolated from the progress of our times. With every step the Iraqi regime takes toward gaining and deploying the most terribleweapons, our own options to confront that regime will narrow. And if an emboldened regimewere to supply these weapons to terrorists allies, then the attacks of September 11 would bea prelude to far greater horrors. If we meet our responsibilities, if we overcome this danger, we can arrive at a very differentfuture. The people of Iraq can shake off their captivity. They can one day join a democraticAfghanistan and a democratic Palestine inspiring reforms throughout the Muslim world. Thesenations can show by their example that honest government and respect for women and thegreat Islamic tradition of learning can triumph in the Middle East and beyond. And we willshow that the promise of the United Nations can be fulfilled in our time. Neither of these outcomes is certain. Both have been set before us. We must choose betweena world of fear and a world of progress. We cannot stand by and do nothing while dangersgather. We must stand up for our security and for the permanent rights and the hopes ofmankind. By heritage and by choice, the United States of America will make that stand. And, delegatesto the United Nations, you have the power to make that stand, as well. Thank you very much.",bush
"Thank you for that very gracious and warm Cincinnati welcome. I'm honored to be heretonight; I appreciate you all coming. Tonight I want to take a few minutes to discuss a grave threat to peace, and America'sdetermination to lead the world in confronting that threat. The threat comes from Iraq. It arises directly from the Iraqi regime's own actions -- its history of aggression, and its drive toward an arsenal of terror. Eleven years ago, as a condition for ending the Persian Gulf War, the Iraqi regime was required to destroy its weapons of mass destruction, to cease all development of such weapons, and to stop all support for terrorist groups. The Iraqi regime has violated all of those obligations. It possesses and produces chemical and biological weapons. It is seeking nuclear weapons. It has given shelter and support to terrorism, and practices terror against its own people. The entire world haswitnessed Iraq's eleven-year history of defiance, deception and bad faith. We also must never forget the most vivid events of recent history. On September the 11th, 2001, America felt its vulnerability -- even to threats that gather on the other side of the earth. We resolved then, and we are resolved today, to confront every threat, from anysource, that could bring sudden terror and suffering to America. Members of the Congress of both political parties, and members of the United Nations Security Council, agree that Saddam Hussein is a threat to peace and must disarm. We agree that the Iraqi dictator must not be permitted to threaten America and the world with horrible poisons and diseases and gases and atomic weapons. Since we all agree on this goal, the issues is :how can we best achieve it? Many Americans have raised legitimate questions: about the nature of the threat; about the urgency of action -- why be concerned now; about the link between Iraq developing weapons of terror, and the wider war on terror. These are all issues we've discussed broadly and fullywithin my administration. And tonight, I want to share those discussions with you. First, some ask why Iraq is different from other countries or regimes that also have terrible weapons. While there are many dangers in the world, the threat from Iraq stands alone -- because it gathers the most serious dangers of our age in one place. Iraq's weapons of mass destruction are controlled by a murderous tyrant who has already used chemical weapons to kill thousands of people. This same tyrant has tried to dominate the Middle East, has invaded and brutally occupied a small neighbor, has struck other nations without warning, and holdsan unrelenting hostility toward the United States. By its past and present actions, by its technological capabilities, by the merciless nature of its regime, Iraq is unique. As a former chief weapons inspector of the U.N. has said, ""The fundamental problem with Iraq remains the nature of the regime, itself. Saddam Hussein is ahomicidal dictator who is addicted to weapons of mass destruction."" Some ask how urgent this danger is to America and the world. The danger is already significant, and it only grows worse with time. If we know Saddam Hussein has dangerous weapons today -- and we do -- does it make any sense for the world to wait to confront himas he grows even stronger and develops even more dangerous weapons? In 1995, after several years of deceit by the Iraqi regime, the head of Iraq's military industries defected. It was then that the regime was forced to admit that it had produced more than 30,000 liters of anthrax and other deadly biological agents. The inspectors, however, concluded that Iraq had likely produced two to four times that amount. This is a massive stockpile of biological weapons that has never been accounted for,and capable of killing millions. We know that the regime has produced thousands of tons of chemical agents, including mustard gas, sarin nerve gas, VX nerve gas. Saddam Hussein also has experience in using chemical weapons. He has ordered chemical attacks on Iran, and on more than forty villages in his own country. These actions killed or injured at least 20,000 people, more than six timesthe number of people who died in the attacks of September the 11th. And surveillance photos reveal that the regime is rebuilding facilities that it had used to produce chemical and biological weapons. Every chemical and biological weapon that Iraq has or makes is a direct violation of the truce that ended the Persian Gulf War in 1991. Yet, Saddam Hussein has chosen to build and keep these weapons despite international sanctions,U.N. demands, and isolation from the civilized world. Iraq possesses ballistic missiles with a likely range of hundreds of miles -- far enough to strike Saudi Arabia, Israel, Turkey, and other nations -- in a region where more than 135,000 American civilians and service members live and work. We've also discovered through intelligence that Iraq has a growing fleet of manned and unmanned aerial vehicles that could be used to disperse chemical or biological weapons across broad areas. We're concerned that Iraq is exploring ways of using these UAVS for missions targeting the United States. And, of course, sophisticated delivery systems aren't required for a chemical or biological attack; all that might be required are a small container and one terrorist or Iraqi intelligence operative todeliver it. And that is the source of our urgent concern about Saddam Hussein's links to international terrorist groups. Over the years, Iraq has provided safe haven to terrorists such as Abu Nidal, whose terror organization carried out more than 90 terrorist attacks in 20 countries that killed or injured nearly 900 people, including 12 Americans. Iraq has also provided safe haven to Abu Abbas, who was responsible for seizing the Achille Lauro and killing an American passenger. And we know that Iraq is continuing to finance terror and gives assistance togroups that use terrorism to undermine Middle East peace. We know that Iraq and the al Qaeda terrorist network share a common enemy -- the United States of America. We know that Iraq and al Qaeda have had high-level contacts that go back a decade. Some al Qaeda leaders who fled Afghanistan went to Iraq. These include one very senior al Qaeda leader who received medical treatment in Baghdad this year, and who has been associated with planning for chemical and biological attacks. We've learned that Iraq has trained al Qaeda members in bomb-making and poisons and deadly gases. And we know that after September the 11th, Saddam Hussein's regime gleefullycelebrated the terrorist attacks on America. Iraq could decide on any given day to provide a biological or chemical weapon to a terrorist group or individual terrorists. Alliance with terrorists could allow the Iraqi regime to attackAmerica without leaving any fingerprints. Some have argued that confronting the threat from Iraq could detract from the war against terror. To the contrary; confronting the threat posed by Iraq is crucial to winning the war on terror. When I spoke to Congress more than a year ago, I said that those who harbor terrorists are as guilty as the terrorists themselves. Saddam Hussein is harboring terrorists and the instruments of terror, the instruments of mass death and destruction. And he cannot be trusted. The risk is simply too great that he will use them, or provide them to a terrornetwork. Terror cells and outlaw regimes building weapons of mass destruction are different faces of the same evil. Our security requires that we confront both. And the United States military iscapable of confronting both. Many people have asked how close Saddam Hussein is to developing a nuclear weapon. Well, we don't know exactly, and that's the problem. Before the Gulf War, the best intelligence indicated that Iraq was eight to ten years away from developing a nuclear weapon. After the war, international inspectors learned that the regime has been much closer -- the regime in Iraq would likely have possessed a nuclear weapon no later than 1993. The inspectors discovered that Iraq had an advanced nuclear weapons development program, had a design for a workable nuclear weapon, and was pursuing several different methods of enrichinguranium for a bomb. Before being barred from Iraq in 1998, the International Atomic Energy Agency dismantled extensive nuclear weapons-related facilities, including three uranium enrichment sites. That same year, information from a high-ranking Iraqi nuclear engineer who had defected revealed that despite his public promises, Saddam Hussein had ordered his nuclear program tocontinue. The evidence indicates that Iraq is reconstituting its nuclear weapons program. Saddam Hussein has held numerous meetings with Iraqi nuclear scientists, a group he calls his ""nuclear mujahideen"" -- his nuclear holy warriors. Satellite photographs reveal that Iraq is rebuilding facilities at sites that have been part of its nuclear program in the past. Iraq has attempted to purchase high-strength aluminum tubes and other equipment needed for gascentrifuges, which are used to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons. If the Iraqi regime is able to produce, buy, or steal an amount of highly enriched uranium a little larger than a single softball, it could have a nuclear weapon in less than a year. And if we allow that to happen, a terrible line would be crossed. Saddam Hussein would be in a position to blackmail anyone who opposes his aggression. He would be in a position to dominate the Middle East. He would be in a position to threaten America. And Saddam Hussein would be ina position to pass nuclear technology to terrorists. Some citizens wonder, after 11 years of living with this problem, why do we need to confront it now? And there's a reason. We've experienced the horror of September the 11th. We have seen that those who hate America are willing to crash airplanes into buildings full of innocent people. Our enemies would be no less willing, in fact, they would be eager, to use biological orchemical, or a nuclear weapon. Knowing these realities, America must not ignore the threat gathering against us. Facing clear evidence of peril, we cannot wait for the final proof -- the smoking gun -- that could come in the form of a mushroom cloud. As President Kennedy said in October of 1962, ""Neither the United States of America, nor the world community of nations can tolerate deliberate deception and offensive threats on the part of any nation, large or small. We no longer live in a world,"" he said, ""where only the actual firing of weapons represents a sufficient challenge toa nations security to constitute maximum peril."" Understanding the threats of our time, knowing the designs and deceptions of the Iraqi regime, we have every reason to assume the worst, and we have an urgent duty to preventthe worst from occurring. Some believe we can address this danger by simply resuming the old approach to inspections, and applying diplomatic and economic pressure. Yet this is precisely what the world has tried to do since 1991. The U.N. inspections program was met with systematic deception. The Iraqi regime bugged hotel rooms and offices of inspectors to find where they were going next; they forged documents, destroyed evidence, and developed mobile weapons facilities to keep a step ahead of inspectors. Eight so-called presidential palaces were declared off-limits to unfettered inspections. These sites actually encompass twelve square miles, with hundreds of structures, both above andbelow the ground, where sensitive materials could be hidden. The world has also tried economic sanctions -- and watched Iraq use billions of dollars in illegal oil revenues to fund more weapons purchases, rather than providing for the needs ofthe Iraqi people. The world has tried limited military strikes to destroy Iraq's weapons of mass destructioncapabilities -- only to see them openly rebuilt, while the regime again denies they even exist. The world has tried no-fly zones to keep Saddam from terrorizing his own people -- and in the last year alone, the Iraqi military has fired upon American and British pilots more than 750times. After eleven years during which we have tried containment, sanctions, inspections, even selected military action, the end result is that Saddam Hussein still has chemical and biological weapons and is increasing his capabilities to make more. And he is moving ever closer todeveloping a nuclear weapon. Clearly, to actually work, any new inspections, sanctions or enforcement mechanisms will have to be very different. America wants the U.N. to be an effective organization that helps keep the peace. And that is why we are urging the Security Council to adopt a new resolution setting out tough, immediate requirements. Among those requirements: the Iraqi regime must reveal and destroy, under U.N. supervision, all existing weapons of mass destruction. To ensure that we learn the truth, the regime must allow witnesses to its illegal activities to be interviewed outside the country -- and these witnesses must be free to bring their families with them so they all beyond the reach of Saddam Hussein's terror and murder. And inspectors must have access to any site, at any time, without pre-clearance, without delay,without exceptions. The time for denying, deceiving, and delaying has come to an end. Saddam Hussein mustdisarm himself -- or, for the sake of peace, we will lead a coalition to disarm him. Many nations are joining us in insisting that Saddam Hussein's regime be held accountable. They are committed to defending the international security that protects the lives of both our citizens and theirs. And that's why America is challenging all nations to take the resolutions ofthe U.N. Security Council seriously. And these resolutions are clear. In addition to declaring and destroying all of its weapons of mass destruction, Iraq must end its support for terrorism. It must cease the persecution of its civilian population. It must stop all illicit trade outside the Oil For Food program. It must release or account for all Gulf War personnel, including an American pilot, whose fate is stillunknown. By taking these steps, and by only taking these steps, the Iraqi regime has an opportunity to avoid conflict. Taking these steps would also change the nature of the Iraqi regime itself. America hopes the regime will make that choice. Unfortunately, at least so far, we have little reason to expect it. And that's why two administrations -- mine and President Clinton's -- have stated that regime change in Iraq is the only certain means of removing a great dangerto our nation. I hope this will not require military action, but it may. And military conflict could be difficult. An Iraqi regime faced with its own demise may attempt cruel and desperate measures. If Saddam Hussein orders such measures, his generals would be well advised to refuse those orders. If they do not refuse, they must understand that all war criminals will be pursued and punished. If we have to act, we will take every precaution that is possible. We will plan carefully; we will act with the full power of the United States military; we will act with allies atour side, and we will prevail. There is no easy or risk-free course of action. Some have argued we should wait -- and that's an option. In my view, it's the riskiest of all options, because the longer we wait, the stronger and bolder Saddam Hussein will become. We could wait and hope that Saddam does not give weapons to terrorists, or develop a nuclear weapon to blackmail the world. But I'm convinced that is a hope against all evidence. As Americans, we want peace -- we work and sacrifice for peace. But there can be no peace if our security depends on the will and whims of a ruthless and aggressive dictator. I'm not willing to stake one American life on trusting SaddamHussein. Failure to act would embolden other tyrants, allow terrorists access to new weapons and new resources, and make blackmail a permanent feature of world events. The United Nations would betray the purpose of its founding, and prove irrelevant to the problems of our time.And through its inaction, the United States would resign itself to a future of fear. That is not the America I know. That is not the America I serve. We refuse to live in fear. This nation, in world war and in Cold War, has never permitted the brutal and lawless to set history's course. Now, as before, we will secure our nation, protect our freedom, and helpothers to find freedom of their own. Some worry that a change of leadership in Iraq could create instability and make the situation worse. The situation could hardly get worse, for world security and for the people of Iraq. The lives of Iraqi citizens would improve dramatically if Saddam Hussein were no longer in power, just as the lives of Afghanistan's citizens improved after the Taliban. The dictator of Iraq is a student of Stalin, using murder as a tool of terror and control, within his own cabinet, withinhis own army, and even within his own family. On Saddam Hussein's orders, opponents have been decapitated, wives and mothers of political opponents have been systematically raped as a method of intimidation, and politicalprisoners have been forced to watch their own children being tortured. America believes that all people are entitled to hope and human rights, to the non-negotiable demands of human dignity. People everywhere prefer freedom to slavery; prosperity to squalor; self-government to the rule of terror and torture. America is a friend to the people of Iraq. Our demands are directed only at the regime that enslaves them and threatens us. When these demands are met, the first and greatest benefit will come to Iraqi men, women and children. The oppression of Kurds, Assyrians, Turkomans, Shi'a, Sunnis and others will belifted. The long captivity of Iraq will end, and an era of new hope will begin. Iraq is a land rich in culture, resources, and talent. Freed from the weight of oppression, Iraq's people will be able to share in the progress and prosperity of our time. If military action is necessary, the United States and our allies will help the Iraqi people rebuild their economy,and create the institutions of liberty in a unified Iraq at peace with its neighbors. Later this week, the United States Congress will vote on this matter. I have asked Congress to authorize the use of America's military, if it proves necessary, to enforce U.N. Security Council demands. Approving this resolution does not mean that military action is imminent or unavoidable. The resolution will tell the United Nations, and all nations, that America speaks with one voice and is determined to make the demands of the civilized world mean something. Congress will also be sending a message to the dictator in Iraq: that his only chance -- hisonly choice is full compliance, and the time remaining for that choice is limited. Members of Congress are nearing an historic vote. I'm confident they will fully consider thefacts, and their duties. The attacks of September the 11th showed our country that vast oceans no longer protect us from danger. Before that tragic date, we had only hints of al Qaeda's plans and designs. Today in Iraq, we see a threat whose outlines are far more clearly defined, and whose consequences could be far more deadly. Saddam Hussein's actions have put us on notice, andthere is no refuge from our responsibilities. We did not ask for this present challenge, but we accept it. Like other generations of Americans, we will meet the responsibility of defending human liberty against violence and aggression. By our resolve, we will give strength to others. By our courage, we will give hopeto others. And by our actions, we will secure the peace, and lead the world to a better day. May God bless America.",bush
"Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, distinguished citizens, and fellow citizens: Every year, by law and by custom, we meet here to consider the state of the union.This year, we gather in this chamber deeply aware of decisive days that lie ahead. You and I serve our country in a time of great consequence. During this session of Congress, we have the duty to reform domestic programs vital to our country and we have the opportunity to save millions of lives abroad from a terrible disease. We will work for a prosperity that is broadly shared and we will answer every danger and every enemy that threatens the American people. In all these days of promise and days of reckoning, we can be confident. In a whirlwind of change, and hope, and peril, our faith is sure, our resolve is firm,and our union is strong. This country has many challenges. We will not deny, we will not ignore, we will not pass along our problems to other Congresses, other presidents, and other generations. We will confront them with focus, and clarity, and courage. During the last two years, we have seen what can be accomplished when we work together. To lift the standards of our public schools, we achieved historic education reform -- which must now be carried out in every school, and every classroom, so that every child in America can read, and learn, and succeed in life. To protect our country, we reorganized our government and created the Department of Homeland Security -- which is mobilizing against the threats of a new era. To bring our economy out of recession, we delivered the largest tax relief in a generation. To insist on integrity in American business, we passed tough reforms,and we are holding corporate criminals to account. Some might call this a good record. I call it a good start. Tonight I ask the House and Senate to join me in the next bold steps to serve our fellow citizens. Our first goal is clear: We must have an economy that grows fast enough to employ every man and woman who seeks a job. After recession, terrorist attacks, corporate scandals, and stock market declines, our economy is recovering -- yet it is not growing fast enough, or strongly enough. With unemployment rising, our Nation needs more small businesses to open, more companies to invest and expand, more employers to put up the sign that says, ""Help Wanted."" Jobs are created when the economy grows; the economy grows when Americans have more money to spend and invest; and the best, fairest way to make sure Americans have that money is not to tax itaway in the first place. I am proposing that all the income tax reductions set for 2004 and 2006 be made permanent and effective this year. And under my plan, as soon as I have signed the bill, this extra money will start showing up in workers' paychecks. Instead of gradually reducing the marriage penalty, we should do it now. Instead of slowly raising the child credit to a thousand dollars, we should send the checks to American families now. This tax relief is for everyone who pays income taxes -- and it will help our economy immediately. Ninety-two million Americans will keep -- this year -- an average of almost 1,100 dollars more of their own money. A family of four with an income of 40,000 dollars would see their federal income taxes fall from 1,178 dollars to 45 dollars per year. And our plan will improve the bottom line for more than 23million small businesses. You, the Congress, have already passed all these reductions, and promised them for future years. If this tax relief is good for Americans three, or five, or seven years from now, it is even better for Americans today. We also strengthen the economy by treating investors equally in our tax laws. It is fair to tax a company's profits. It is not fair to again tax the shareholder on the same profits. To boost investor confidence, and to help the nearly 10 million seniors who receive dividend income, I ask you to end the unfair double taxation of dividends. Lower taxes and greater investment will help this economy expand. More jobs mean more taxpayers -- and higher revenues to our government. The best way to address the deficit and move toward a balanced budget is to encourage economic growth -- and to show some spending discipline in Washington, D.C. We must work together to fund only our most important priorities. I will send you a budget that increases discretionary spending by four percent next year -- about as much as the average family's income is expected to grow. And that is a good benchmark for us: Federal spending should not rise any faster than the paychecks of American families. A growing economy, and a focus on essential priorities, will also be crucial to the future of Social Security. As we continue to work together to keep Social Security sound and reliable, we must offer younger workers a chance to invest in retirement accounts that they will control and theywill own. Our second goal is high quality, affordable health care for all Americans. The American system of medicine is a model of skill and innovation -- with a pace of discovery that is adding good years to our lives. Yet for many people, medical care costs too much -- and many have no coverage at all. These problems will not be solved with a nationalized health care system that dictates coverage and rations care. Instead, we must work toward a system in which all Americans have a good insurance policy, choose their own doctors, and seniors and low- income Americans receive the help they need. Instead of bureaucrats, and trial lawyers, andHMOs, we must put doctors, and nurses, and patients back in charge of American medicine. Health care reform must begin with Medicare, because Medicare is the binding commitment of a caring society. We must renew that commitment by giving seniors access to the preventive medicine and new drugs that are transforming health care in America. Seniors happy with the current Medicare system should be able to keep their coverage just the way it is. And just like you, the members of Congress, members of your staffs, and other federal employees, all seniors should have the choice of a health care plan that provides prescription drugs. My budget will commit an additional 400 billion dollars over the next decade to reform and strengthen Medicare. Leaders of both political parties have talked for years about strengthening Medicare -- I urge the members of this new Congress to act this year. To improve our health care system, we must address one of the prime causes of higher costs -- the constant threat that physicians and hospitals will be unfairly sued. Because of excessive litigation, everybody pays more for health care -- and many parts of America are losing fine doctors. No one has ever been healed by a frivolous lawsuit -- and I urge the Congress topass medical liability reform. Our third goal is to promote energy independence for our country, while dramatically improving the environment. I have sent you a comprehensive energy plan to promote energy efficiency and conservation, to develop cleaner technology, and to produce more energy at home. I have sent you Clear Skies legislation that mandates a 70 percent cut in air pollution from power plants over the next 15 years. I have sent you a Healthy Forests Initiative, to help prevent the catastrophic fires that devastate communities, kill wildlife, and burn away millionsof acres of treasured forest. I urge you to pass these measures, for the good of both our environment and our economy. Even more, I ask you to take a crucial step, and protect our environment in ways that generations before us could not have imagined. In this century, the greatest environmental progress will come about, not through endless lawsuits or command and control regulations, but through technology and innovation. Tonight I am proposing 1.2 billion dollars in research funding so that America can lead the world in developing clean, hydrogen-powered automobiles. A simple chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen generates energy, which can be used to power a car -- producing only water, not exhaust fumes. With a new national commitment, our scientists and engineers will overcome obstacles to taking these cars from laboratory to showroom -- so that the first car driven by a child born today could be powered by hydrogen, and pollution-free. Join me in this important innovation -- to make our air significantly cleaner, and our country much less dependent on foreign sources of energy. Our fourth goal is to apply the compassion of America to the deepest problems of America. For so many in our country -- the homeless, the fatherless, the addicted -- the need is great. Yet there is power -- wonder-working power -- in the goodness, and idealism, and faith of theAmerican people. Americans are doing the work of compassion every day -- visiting prisoners, providing shelter to battered women, bringing companionship to lonely seniors. These good works deserve our praise; they deserve our personal support; and, when appropriate, they deserve the assistance of our government. I urge you to pass both my faith-based initiative and the Citizen Service Act -- to encourageacts of compassion that can transform America, one heart and one soul at a time. Last year, I called on my fellow citizens to participate in USA Freedom Corps, which is enlisting tens of thousands of new volunteers across America. Tonight I ask Congress and the American people to focus the spirit of service and the resources of government on the needs of some of our most vulnerable citizens -- boys and girls trying to grow up without guidance and attention, and children who have to go through a prison gate to be hugged by their mom or dad. I propose a 450 million dollar initiative to bring mentors to more than a million disadvantaged junior high students and children of prisoners. Government will support the training and recruiting of mentors, yet it is the men and women of America who will fill the need. One mentor, one person, can change a life forever -- and I urge you to be that oneperson. Another cause of hopelessness is addiction to drugs. Addiction crowds out friendship, ambition, moral conviction, and reduces all the richness of life to a single destructive desire. As a government, we are fighting illegal drugs by cutting off supplies, and reducing demand through anti-drug education programs. Yet for those already addicted, the fight against drugs is a fight for their own lives. Too many Americans in search of treatment cannot get it. So tonight I propose a new 600 million dollar program to help an additional 300,000 Americansreceive treatment over the next three years. Our Nation is blessed with recovery programs that do amazing work. One of them is found at the Healing Place Church in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. A man in the program said, ""God does miracles in people's lives, and you never think it could be you."" Tonight, let us bring to all Americans who struggle with drug addiction this message of hope: The miracle of recovery is possible, and it could be you. By caring for children who need mentors, and for addicted men and women who need treatment, we are building a more welcoming society -- a culture that values every life. And in this work we must not overlook the weakest among us. I ask you to protect infants at the very hour of birth, and end the practice of partial-birth abortion. And because no human life should be started or ended as the object of an experiment, I ask you toset a high standard for humanity and pass a law against all human cloning. The qualities of courage and compassion that we strive for in America also determine our conduct abroad. The American flag stands for more than our power and our interests. Our Founders dedicated this country to the cause of human dignity -- the rights of every person and the possibilities of every life. This conviction leads us into the world to help the afflicted, and defend the peace, and confound the designs of evil men. In Afghanistan, we helped to liberate an oppressed people, and we will continue helping them secure their country, rebuild their society, and educate all their children -- boys and girls. In the Middle East, we will continue to seek peace between a secure Israel and a democratic Palestine. Across the earth, America is feeding the hungry; more than 60 percent of international food aid comes as a giftfrom the people of the United States. As our Nation moves troops and builds alliances to make our world safer, we must also remember our calling, as a blessed country, to make this world better. Today, on the continent of Africa, nearly 30 million people have the AIDS virus -- including three million children under the age of 15. There are whole countries in Africa where more than one-third of the adult population carries the infection. More than four million require immediate drug treatment. Yet across that continent, only 50,000 AIDS victims -- only 50,000 -- are receivingthe medicine they need. Because the AIDS diagnosis is considered a death sentence, many do not seek treatment. Almost all who do are turned away. A doctor in rural South Africa describes his frustration. He says, ""We have no medicines. Wany hospitals tell [people], 'You've got AIDS. We can't help you. Go home and die.'"" In an age of miraculous medicines, no person should have to hear those words. AIDS can be prevented. Anti-retroviral drugs can extend life for many years. And the cost of those drugs has dropped from 12,000 dollars a year to under 300 dollars a year --which places a tremendous possibility within our grasp. Ladies and gentlemen, seldom has history offered a greater opportunity to do so much for so many. We have confronted, and will continue to confront, HIV/AIDS in our own country. And to meet a severe and urgent crisis abroad, tonight I propose the Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief -- a work of mercy beyond all current international efforts to help the people of Africa. This comprehensive plan will prevent seven million new AIDS infections, treat at least two million people with life-extending drugs, and provide humane care for millions of people suffering from AIDS, and for children orphaned by AIDS. I ask the Congress to commit 15 billion dollars over the next five years, including nearly ten billion dollars in new money, to turn the tide against AIDS in the most afflicted nations ofAfrica and the Caribbean. This Nation can lead the world in sparing innocent people from a plague of nature. And this Nation is leading the world in confronting and defeating the man-made evil of international terrorism. There are days when the American people do not hear news about the war on terror. There is never a day when I do not learn of another threat, or receive reports of operations in progress, or give an order in this global war against a scattered network of killers. The war goes on, and we are winning. To date we have arrested, or otherwise dealt with, many key commanders of al-Qaida. They include a man who directed logistics and funding for the September 11th attacks, the chief of al-Qaida operations in the Persian Gulf who planned the bombings of our embassies in East Africa and the USS Cole, an al-Qaida operations chief from Southeast Asia, a former director of al-Qaida's training camps in Afghanistan, a key al-Qaida operative in Europe, and a major al-Qaida leader in Yemen. All told, more than 3,000 suspected terrorists have been arrested in many countries. And many others have met a different fate. They are no longer a problem for the United States and ourfriends and allies. We are working closely with other nations to prevent further attacks. America and coalition countries have uncovered and stopped terrorist conspiracies targeting the American embassy in Yemen, the American embassy in Singapore, a Saudi military base, and ships in the straits of Hormuz, and the straits of Gibraltar. We have broken al-Qaida cells in Hamburg, and Milan, and Madrid, and London, and Paris -- as well as Buffalo, New York. We have the terrorists on the run, and we are keeping them on the run. One by one, the terrorists are learning the meaning of American justice. As we fight this war, we will remember where it began -- here, in our own country. This government is taking unprecedented measures to protect our people and defend our homeland. We have intensified security at the borders and ports of entry, posted more than 50,000 newly trained federal screeners in airports, begun inoculating troops and first responders against smallpox, and are deploying the Nation's first early warning network of sensors to detect biological attack. And this year, for the first time, we arebeginning to field a defense to protect this Nation against ballistic missiles. I thank the Congress for supporting these measures. I ask you tonight to add to our future security with a major research and production effort to guard our people against bio- terrorism, called Project Bioshield. The budget I send you will propose almost six billion dollars to quickly make available effective vaccines and treatments against agents like anthrax, botulinum toxin, Ebola, and plague. We must assume that our enemies would use thesediseases as weapons, and we must act before the dangers are upon us. Since September 11th, our intelligence and law enforcement agencies have worked more closely than ever to track and disrupt the terrorists. The FBI is improving its ability to analyze intelligence, and transforming itself to meet new threats. And tonight, I am instructing the leaders of the FBI, Central Intelligence, Homeland Security, and the Department of Defense to develop a Terrorist Threat Integration Center, to merge and analyze all threat information in a single location. Our government must have the very best information possible, and we will use it to make sure the right people are in the right places to protect our citizens. Our war against terror is a contest of will, in which perseverance is power. In the ruins of two towers, at the western wall of the Pentagon, on a field in Pennsylvania, this Nation made a pledge, and we renew that pledge tonight: Whatever the duration of this struggle, and whatever the difficulties, we will not permit the triumph of violence in the affairs of men     freepeople will set the course of history. Today, the gravest danger in the war on terror, the gravest danger facing America and the world, is outlaw regimes that seek and possess nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. These regimes could use such weapons for blackmail, terror, and mass murder. They could also give or sell those weapons to their terrorist allies, who would use them without the least hesitation. This threat is new; America's duty is familiar. Throughout the 20th century, small groups of men seized control of great nations, built armies and arsenals, and set out to dominate the weak and intimidate the world. In each case, their ambitions of cruelty and murder had no limit. In each case, the ambitions of Hitlerism, militarism, and communism were defeated by the will of free peoples, by the strength of great alliances, and by the might of the United States of America. Now, in this century, the ideology of power and domination has appeared again, and seeks to gain the ultimate weapons of terror. Once again, this Nation and our friends are all that stand between a world at peace, and a world of chaos and constant alarm. Once again, we are called to defend the safety of our people, and the hopesof all mankind. And we accept this responsibility. America is making a broad and determined effort to confront these dangers. We have called on the United Nations to fulfill its charter, and stand by its demand that Iraq disarm. We are strongly supporting the International Atomic Energy Agency in its mission to track and control nuclear materials around the world. We are working with other governments to secure nuclear materials in the former Soviet Union, and to strengthen global treaties banning the productionand shipment of missile technologies and weapons of mass destruction. In all of these efforts, however, America's purpose is more than to follow a process -- it is to achieve a result: the end of terrible threats to the civilized world. All free nations have a stake in preventing sudden and catastrophic attack. We are asking them to join us, and many are doing so. Yet the course of this Nation does not depend on the decisions of others. Whatever action is required, whenever action is necessary, I will defend the freedom and security of the American people. Different threats require different strategies. In Iran, we continue to see a government that represses its people, pursues weapons of mass destruction, and supports terror. We also see Iranian citizens risking intimidation and death as they speak out for liberty, human rights, and democracy. Iranians, like all people, have a right to choose their own government, and determine their own destiny -- and the United States supports theiraspirations to live in freedom. On the Korean peninsula, an oppressive regime rules a people living in fear and starvation. Throughout the 1990s, the United States relied on a negotiated framework to keep North Korea from gaining nuclear weapons. We now know that the regime was deceiving the world, and developing those weapons all along. And today the North Korean regime is using its nuclear program to incite fear and seek concessions. America and the world will not be blackmailed. America is working with the countries of the region -- South Korea, Japan, China, and Russia -- to find a peaceful solution, and to show the North Korean government that nuclear weapons will bring only isolation, economic stagnation, and continued hardship. The North Korean regime will find respect in the world, and revival for its people, only when itturns away from its nuclear ambitions. Our Nation and the world must learn the lessons of the Korean peninsula, and not allow an even greater threat to rise up in Iraq. A brutal dictator, with a history of reckless aggression, with ties to terrorism, with great potential wealth, will not be permitted to dominate a vital region and threaten the United States. Twelve years ago, Saddam Hussein faced the prospect of being the last casualty in a war he had started and lost. To spare himself, he agreed to disarm of all weapons of mass destruction. For the next 12 years, he systematically violated that agreement. He pursued chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons even while inspectors were in his country. Nothing to date has restrained him from his pursuit of these weapons -- not economic sanctions, not isolation from the civilized world, not even cruise missile strikes on his military facilities. Almost three months ago, the United Nations Security Council gave Saddam Hussein his final chance to disarm. He has showninstead his utter contempt for the United Nations, and for the opinion of the world. The 108 UN weapons inspectors were not sent to conduct a scavenger hunt for hidden materials across a country the size of California. The job of the inspectors is to verify that Iraq's regime is disarming. It is up to Iraq to show exactly where it is hiding its banned weapons, lay those weapons out for the world to see, and destroy them as directed. Nothinglike this has happened. The United Nations concluded in 1999 that Saddam Hussein had biological weapons materials sufficient to produce over 25,000 liters of anthrax -- enough doses to kill several million people. He has not accounted for that material. He has given no evidence that he has destroyed it. The United Nations concluded that Saddam Hussein had materials sufficient to produce more than 38,000 liters of botulinum toxin -- enough to subject millions of people to death by respiratory failure. He has not accounted for that material. He has given no evidencethat he has destroyed it. Our intelligence officials estimate that Saddam Hussein had the materials to produce as much as 500 tons of sarin, mustard, and VX nerve agent. In such quantities, these chemical agents also could kill untold thousands. He has not accounted for these materials. He has given no evidence that he has destroyed them. U.S. intelligence indicates that Saddam Hussein had upwards of 30,000 munitions capable of delivering chemical agents. Inspectors recently turned up 16 of them, despite Iraq's recent declaration denying their existence. Saddam Hussein has not accounted for the remaining 29,984 of these prohibited munitions. He has given no evidence that he has destroyed them. From three Iraqi defectors we know that Iraq, in the late 1990s, had several mobile biological weapons labs. These are designed to produce germ warfare agents, and can be moved from place to place to evade inspectors. Saddam Hussein has not disclosed these facilities. He has given no evidence that he has destroyedthem. The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed in the 1990s that Saddam Hussein had an advanced nuclear weapons development program, had a design for a nuclear weapon, and was working on five different methods of enriching uranium for a bomb. The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa. Our intelligence sources tell us that he has attempted to purchase high strength aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production. Saddam Hussein has notcredibly explained these activities. He clearly has much to hide. The dictator of Iraq is not disarming. To the contrary, he is deceiving. From intelligence sources, we know, for instance, that thousands of Iraqi security personnel are at work hiding documents and materials from the UN inspectors -- sanitizing inspection sites, and monitoring the inspectors themselves. Iraqi officials accompany the inspectors in order to intimidate witnesses. Iraq is blocking U-2 surveillance flights requested by the United Nations. Iraqi intelligence officers are posing as the scientists inspectors are supposed to interview. Real scientists have been coached by Iraqi officials on what to say. And intelligence sources indicate that Saddam Hussein has ordered that scientists who cooperate with UN inspectors indisarming Iraq will be killed, along with their families. Year after year, Saddam Hussein has gone to elaborate lengths, spent enormous sums, taken great risks, to build and keep weapons of mass destruction -- but why? The only possible explanation, the only possible use he could have for those weapons, is to dominate, intimidate, or attack. With nuclear arms or a full arsenal of chemical and biological weapons, Saddam Hussein could resume his ambitions of conquest in the Middle East, and create deadly havoc in the region. And this Congress and the American people must recognize another threat. Evidence from intelligence sources, secret communications, and statements by people now in custody, reveal that Saddam Hussein aids and protects terrorists, including members of al-Qaida. Secretly, and without fingerprints, he could provide one of his hidden weapons toterrorists, or help them develop their own. Before September 11, 2001, many in the world believed that Saddam Hussein could be contained. But chemical agents and lethal viruses and shadowy terrorist networks are not easily contained. Imagine those 19 hijackers with other weapons, and other plans -- this time armed by Saddam Hussein. It would take just one vial, one canister, one crate slipped into this country to bring a day of horror like none we have ever known. We will do everything inour power to make sure that day never comes. Some have said we must not act until the threat is imminent. Since when have terrorists and tyrants announced their intentions, politely putting us on notice before they strike? If this threat is permitted to fully and suddenly emerge, all actions, all words, and all recriminations would come too late. Trusting in the sanity and restraint of Saddam Hussein is not a strategy,and it is not an option. This dictator, who is assembling the world's most dangerous weapons, has already used them on whole villages -- leaving thousands of his own citizens dead, blind, or disfigured. Iraqi refugees tell us how forced confessions are obtained -- by torturing children while their parents are made to watch. International human rights groups have catalogued other methods used in the torture chambers of Iraq: electric shock, burning with hot irons, drippingacid on the skin, mutilation with electric drills, cutting out tongues, and rape. If this is not evil, then evil has no meaning. And tonight I have a message for the brave and oppressed people of Iraq: Your enemy is not surrounding your country -- your enemy is ruling your country. And the day he and his regimeare removed from power will be the day of your liberation. The world has waited 12 years for Iraq to disarm. America will not accept a serious and mounting threat to our country, our friends, and our allies. The United States will ask the UN Security Council to convene on February 5th to consider the facts of Iraq's ongoing defiance of the world. Secretary of State Powell will present information and intelligence about Iraq's illegal weapons programs; its attempts to hide those weapons from inspectors; and its links to terrorist groups. We will consult, but let there be no misunderstanding: If Saddam Hussein does not fully disarm, for the safety of our people, and for the peace of the world, we will leada coalition to disarm him. Tonight I also have a message for the men and women who will keep the peace, members of the American Armed Forces: Many of you are assembling in and near the Middle East, and some crucial hours may lie ahead. In those hours, the success of our cause will depend on you. Your training has prepared you. Your honor will guide you. You believe in America, and America believes in you. Sending Americans into battle is the most profound decision a president can make. The technologies of war have changed. The risks and suffering of war have not. For the brave Americans who bear the risk, no victory is free from sorrow. This Nation fights reluctantly,because we know the cost, and we dread the days of mourning that always come. We seek peace. We strive for peace. And sometimes peace must be defended. A future lived at the mercy of terrible threats is no peace at all. If war is forced upon us, we will fight in a just cause and by just means -- sparing, in every way we can, the innocent. And if war is forced upon us, we will fight with the full force and might of the United States military -- and we will prevail. And as we and our coalition partners are doing in Afghanistan, we will bring tothe Iraqi people food, and medicines, and supplies and freedom. Many challenges, abroad and at home, have arrived in a single season. In two years, America has gone from a sense of invulnerability to an awareness of peril, from bitter division in small matters to calm unity in great causes. And we go forward with confidence, because this call of history has come to the right country. Americans are a resolute people, who have risen to every test of our time. Adversity has revealed the character of our country, to the world, and to ourselves. America is a strong Nation, and honorable in the use of our strength. We exercise power without conquest, and sacrifice for the liberty of strangers. Americans are a free people, who know that freedom is the right of every person and the future of everynation. The liberty we prize is not America's gift to the world, it is God's gift to humanity. We Americans have faith in ourselves -- but not in ourselves alone. We do not claim to know all the ways of Providence, yet we can trust in them, placing our confidence in the loving God behind all of life, and all of history. May He guide us now, and may God continue to bless theUnited States of America. Thank you.",bush
"My  fellow  Americans,  this  day  has  brought  terrible  news  and  great  sadness  to  our  country.  At   nine  o'clock  this  morning,  Mission  Control  in  Houston  lost  contact  with  our  Space  Shuttle   Columbia.  A  short  time  later,  debris  was  seen  falling  from  the  skies  above  Texas.  The   Columbia  is  lost    there  are  no  survivors.   On  board  was  a  crew  of  seven:  Colonel  Rick  Husband    Lt.  Colonel  Michael  Anderson     Commander  Laurel  Clark    Captain  David  Brown    Commander  William  McCool    Dr.  Kalpana   Chawla    and  Ilan  Ramon,  a  Colonel  in  the  Israeli  Air  Force.  These  men  and  women  assumed   great  risk  in  the  service  to  all  humanity.   In  an  age  when  space  flight  has  come  to  seem  almost  routine,  it  is  easy  to  overlook  the   dangers  of  travel  by  rocket,  and  the  difficulties  of  navigating  the  fierce  outer  atmosphere  of   the  Earth.  These  astronauts  knew  the  dangers,  and  they  faced  them  willingly,  knowing  they   had  a  high  and  noble  purpose  in  life.  Because  of  their  courage,  and  daring,  and  idealism,  we   will  miss  them  all  the  more.    All  Americans  today  are  thinking,  as  well,  of  the  families  of  these  men  and  women  who  have   been  given  this  sudden  shock  and  grief.  You're  not  alone.  Our  entire  nation  grieves  with  you.   And  those  you  loved  will  always  have  the  respect  and  gratitude  of  this  country.  The  cause  in   which  they  died  will  continue.  Mankind  is  led  into  the  darkness  beyond  our  world  by  the   inspiration  of  discovery  and  the  longing  to  understand.   Our  journey  into  space  will  go  on.   In  the  skies  today  we  saw  destruction  and  tragedy.  Yet  farther  than  we  can  see,  there  is   comfort  and  hope.  In  the  words  of  the  prophet  Isaiah,  ""Lift  your  eyes  and  look  to  the  heavens.   Who  created  all  these?  He  who  brings  out  the  starry  hosts  one  by  one  and  calls  them  each  by   name.  Because  of  His  great  power,  and  mighty  strength,  not  one  of  them  is  missing.""   The  same  Creator  who  names  the  stars  also  knows  the  names  of  the  seven  souls  we  mourn   today.  The  crew  of  the  shuttle  Columbia  did  not  return  safely  to  Earth    yet  we  can  pray  that   all  are  safely  home.   May  God  bless  the  grieving  families.  And  may        may  God  continue  to  bless  America.",bush
"Thank you. Don't go overboard. Sit down, please -- no place to sit. Okay, don't sit down. Thank you all for coming. Mr. Vice President, thank you very much. Chief of Staff Card, I'm honored to have you by my side. I started work this morning and there he was, smiling andready to go on behalf of the American people. The First Lady and I have -- are honored to be living here and we're honored to be hostingthis event, the first we've done in this glorious room since -- since the Inauguration. I want to thank the family members who are here; thank you for your sacrifice; thank you for the long hours, accepting the long hours that your loved one is about to put in on behalf of the American people. Some of the folks that are here have worked in past Administrations. Some of us, this is a new experience. But for all of us, it is an honor of a lifetime and it is ourprivilege to share this together. I am here to lead the Executive Branch of government. You all are here because you have my full confidence. And we are here with the same basic purpose: to serve the American people.We have all taken an oath, and from this moment on it is our jobs to honor it. Today, everything is so promising and new. My hope is that the day will never come when any of us take[s] this place for granted, and this honor for granted. As we serve, we must alwaysremember three things: First, we must remember the high standards that come with high office. This begins with careful adherence to the rules. I expect every member of this Administration to stay well within the boundaries that define legal and ethical conduct. This means avoiding even the appearance of problems. This means checking and, if need be, double-checking that the rules have been obeyed. This means never compromising those rules. No one in the White House should be afraid to confront the people they work for, for ethical concerns. And no one should hesitate to confront me, as well. We're all accountable to one another. And above all, we're all accountable to the law and to the American people. My White House Counsel, Al Gonzalez, is my point man on these issues. If you have even a hint of ethical doubt, I urge you to talk toAl. Second, we must remember that high standards of conduct involve not only obeying the law, but showing civility. As we go about our work there is no excuse for arrogance, and never a reason for disrespect toward others. People who work here are highly visible throughout the government. In many way -- In many of your dealings, you'll be the face and voice of the White House staff. You'll be my representative. I expect each of you, as an official of thisAdministration, to be an example of humility and decency and fairness. And, finally, we must all remember that we are here for a reason. You and I and the Vice President share the same goals for our country and the same commitment to achieving them. We are here to make progress. We are not here just to mark time. The next few weeks we'll affirm the central policy goals of this Administration, beginning this week with education reform. Everyone will know where we stand. Everyone will know where we're headed. Every morning I want you to remember these goals. Every evening I want you to review the progress we have made. I want it said of us, at the end of our service, that ""promises madewere promises kept."" On a mantle piece in this Great House is inscribed the prayer of John Adams, that only the ""wise"" and ""honest"" may ""rule under this roof.""1 He was speaking of those who live here. But wisdom and honesty are also required of those who work here. I know each of you is capable of meeting that charge. This is only our second day, but times [sic] moves fast around here.So let us begin the work we were hired to do and leave this a better place than we found it. God bless. 1 John Adams, Second President of the United States, Letter to Abigail, November 2, 1800, on moving into the White House",bush
"Their mission was almost complete, and we lost them so close to home. The men and womenof the Columbia had journeyed more than 6 million miles and were minutes away from arrivaland reunion. The loss was sudden and terrible, and for their families, the grief is heavy. Our nation sharesin your sorrow and in your pride. And today we remember not only one moment of tragedy,but seven lives of great purpose and achievement. To leave behind Earth and air and gravity is an ancient dream of humanity. For these seven, itwas a dream fulfilled. Each of these astronauts had the daring and discipline required of theircalling. Each of them knew that great endeavors are inseparable from great risks. And each ofthem accepted those risks willingly, even joyfully, in the cause of discovery. Rick Husband was a boy of four when he first thought of being an astronaut. As a man, and having become an astronaut, he found it was even more important to love hisfamily and serve his Lord. One of Rick's favorite hymns was, ""How Great Thou Art,"" whichoffers these words of praise: ""I see the stars. I hear the mighty thunder. Thy powerthroughout the universe displayed."" David Brown was first drawn to the stars as a little boy with a telescope in his back yard. He admired astronauts, but, as he said, ""I thought they were movie stars. Ithought I was kind of a normal kid."" David grew up to be a physician, an aviator who couldland on the deck of a carrier in the middle of the night, and a shuttle astronaut. His brotherasked him several weeks ago what would happen if something went wrong on their mission.David replied, ""This program will go on."" Michael Anderson always wanted to fly planes, and rose to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the Air Force. Along the way, he became a role model -- especially forhis two daughters and for the many children he spoke to in schools. He said to them,""Whatever you want to be in life, you're training for it now."" He also told his minister, ""If thisthing doesn't come out right, don't worry about me. I'm just going on higher."" Laurel Salton Clark was a physician and a flight surgeon who loved adventure, loved her work, loved her husband, and her son. A friend who heard Laurel speaking toMission Control said, ""There was a smile in her voice."" Laurel conducted some of theexperiments as Columbia orbited the Earth, and described seeing new life emerge from a tinycocoon. ""Life,"" she said, ""continues in a lot of places, and life is a magical thing."" None of our astronauts traveled a longer path to space than Kalpana Chawla. She left India as a student, but she would see the nation of her birth -- all of it -- fromhundreds of miles above. When the sad news reached her home town, an administrator at herhigh school recalled, ""She always said she wanted to reach the stars. She went there -- andbeyond."" Kalpana's native country mourns her today, and so does her adopted land. Ilan Ramon also flew above his home, the land of Israel. He said, ""The quiet that envelopes space makes the beauty even more powerful. And I only hope that the quietcan one day spread to my country."" Ilan was a patriot -- the devoted son of a holocaustsurvivor, served his country in two wars. ""Ilan,"" said his wife, Rona, ""left us at his peakmoment, in his favorite place, with people he loved."" The Columbia's pilot was Commander Willie McCool, whom friends knew as the most steady and dependable of men. In Lubbock today, they're thinking back to the EagleScout who became a distinguished Naval officer, and a fearless test pilot. One friendremembers Willie this way: ""He was blessed; and we were blessed to know him."" Our whole nation was blessed to have such men and women serving in our space program.Their loss is deeply felt, especially in this place, where so many of you called them friends.The people in NASA are being tested once again. In your grief, you are responding as yourfriends would have wished -- with focus, professionalism, and unbroken faith in the mission ofthis agency. Captain Brown was correct: America's space program will go on. This cause of exploration and discovery is not an option we choose; it is a desire written in thehuman heart. We are that part of creation which seeks to understand all creation. We find thebest among us, send them forth into unmapped darkness, and pray they will return. They goin peace for all mankind, and all mankind is in their debt. Yet, some explorers do not return. And the loss settles unfairly on a few. The families heretoday shared in the courage of those they loved. But now they must face life and grief withoutthem. The sorrow is lonely; but you are not alone. In time, you will find comfort and the graceto see you through. And in God's own time, we can pray that the day of your reunion willcome. And to the children who miss your Mom or Dad so much today, you need to know they loveyou, and that love will always be with you. They were proud of you. And you can be proud ofthem for the rest of your life. The final days of their own lives were spent looking down upon this Earth. And now, on everycontinent, in every land they could see, the names of these astronauts are known andremembered. They will always have an honored place in the memory of this country. Andtoday I offer the respect and gratitude of the people of the United States. May God bless you all.",bush
"Thanks for the warm welcome. I'm proud to be with the scholars, and the friends, and the supporters of the American Enterprise Institute. I want to thank you for overlooking my dress code violation. They were about to stop me at the door, but Irving Kristol said, ""I know thisguy, let him in."" Chris, thank you for your very kind introduction, and thank you for your leadership. I see many distinguished guests here tonight -- members of my Cabinet, members of Congress, Justice Scalia, Justice Thomas, and so many respected writers and policy experts. I'm always happy to see your Senior Fellow, Dr. Lynne Cheney. Lynne is a wise and thoughtful commentator on history and culture, and a dear friend to Laura and me. I'm also familiar with the good work of her husband -- You may remember him, the former director of my vicepresidential search committee. Thank God Dick Cheney said yes. Thanks for fitting me into the program tonight. I know I'm not the featured speaker. I'm just a warm-up act for Allan Meltzer. But I want to congratulate Dr. Meltzer for a lifetime ofachievement, and for tonight's well-deserved honor. Congratulations. At the American Enterprise Institute, some of the finest minds in our nation are at work on some of the greatest challenges to our nation. You do such good work that my administration has borrowed 20 such minds. I want to thank them for their service, but I also want to remind people that for 60 years, AEI scholars have made vital contributions to our country and to ourgovernment, and we are grateful for those contributions. We meet here during a crucial period in the history of our nation, and of the civilized world. Part of that history was written by others; the rest will be written by us. On a September morning, threats that had gathered for years, in secret and far away, led to murder in our country on a massive scale. As a result, we must look at security in a new way, because ourcountry is a battlefield in the first war of the 21st century. We learned a lesson: The dangers of our time must be confronted actively and forcefully, before we see them again in our skies and in our cities. And we set a goal: we will not allowthe triumph of hatred and violence in the affairs of men. Our coalition of more than 90 countries is pursuing the networks of terror with every tool of law enforcement and with military power. We have arrested, or otherwise dealt with, many key commanders of al Qaeda. Across the world, we are hunting down the killers one by one. We are winning. And we're showing them the definition of American justice. And we are opposing the greatest danger in the war on terror: outlaw regimes arming with weapons ofmass destruction. In Iraq, a dictator is building and hiding weapons that could enable him to dominate the Middle East and intimidate the civilized world -- and we will not allow it. This same tyrant has close ties to terrorist organizations, and could supply them with the terrible means to strike this country -- and America will not permit it. The danger posed by Saddam Hussein and his weapons cannot be ignored or wished away. The danger must be confronted. We hope that the Iraqi regime will meet the demands of the United Nations and disarm, fully and peacefully. If it does not, we are prepared to disarm Iraq by force. Either way, this danger will beremoved. The safety of the American people depends on ending this direct and growing threat. Acting against the danger will also contribute greatly to the long-term safety and stability of our world. The current Iraqi regime has shown the power of tyranny to spread discord and violence in the Middle East. A liberated Iraq can show the power of freedom to transform that vital region, by bringing hope and progress into the lives of millions. America's interests in security, and America's belief in liberty, both lead in the same direction: to a free and peacefulIraq. The first to benefit from a free Iraq would be the Iraqi people, themselves. Today they live in scarcity and fear, under a dictator who has brought them nothing but war, and misery, and torture. Their lives and their freedom matter little to Saddam Hussein -- but Iraqi lives andfreedom matter greatly to us. Bringing stability and unity to a free Iraq will not be easy. Yet that is no excuse to leave the Iraqi regime's torture chambers and poison labs in operation. Any future the Iraqi people choose for themselves will be better than the nightmare world that Saddam Hussein haschosen for them. If we must use force, the United States and our coalition stand ready to help the citizens of a liberated Iraq. We will deliver medicine to the sick, and we are now moving into place nearly 3million emergency rations to feed the hungry. We'll make sure that Iraq's 55,000 food distribution sites, operating under the Oil For Food program, are stocked and open as soon as possible. The United States and Great Britain are providing tens of millions of dollars to the U.N. High Commission on Refugees, and to suchgroups as the World Food Program and UNICEF, to provide emergency aid to the Iraqi people. We will also lead in carrying out the urgent and dangerous work of destroying chemical and biological weapons. We will provide security against those who try to spread chaos, or settle scores, or threaten the territorial integrity of Iraq. We will seek to protect Iraq's natural resources from sabotage by a dying regime, and ensure those resources are used for thebenefit of the owners -- the Iraqi people. The United States has no intention of determining the precise form of Iraq's new government. That choice belongs to the Iraqi people. Yet, we will ensure that one brutal dictator is not replaced by another. All Iraqis must have a voice in the new government, and all citizens musthave their rights protected. Rebuilding Iraq will require a sustained commitment from many nations, including our own: we will remain in Iraq as long as necessary, and not a day more. America has made and kept this kind of commitment before -- in the peace that followed a world war. After defeating enemies, we did not leave behind occupying armies, we left constitutions and parliaments. We established an atmosphere of safety, in which responsible, reform-minded local leaders could build lasting institutions of freedom. In societies that once bred fascism and militarism, libertyfound a permanent home. There was a time when many said that the cultures of Japan and Germany were incapable of sustaining democratic values. Well, they were wrong. Some say the same of Iraq today. They are mistaken. The nation of Iraq -- with its proud heritage, abundant resources and skilledand educated people -- is fully capable of moving toward democracy and living in freedom. The world has a clear interest in the spread of democratic values, because stable and free nations do not breed the ideologies of murder. They encourage the peaceful pursuit of a better life. And there are hopeful signs of a desire for freedom in the Middle East. Arab intellectuals have called on Arab governments to address the ""freedom gap"" so their peoples can fully share in the progress of our times. Leaders in the region speak of a new Arab charter that champions internal reform, greater politics participation, economic openness, and free trade. And from Morocco to Bahrain and beyond, nations are taking genuine steps toward politics reform. A new regime in Iraq would serve as a dramatic and inspiring example of freedom forother nations in the region. It is presumptuous and insulting to suggest that a whole region of the world -- or the one-fifth of humanity that is Muslim -- is somehow untouched by the most basic aspirations of life. Human cultures can be vastly different. Yet the human heart desires the same good things, everywhere on Earth. In our desire to be safe from brutal and bullying oppression, human beings are the same. In our desire to care for our children and give them a better life, we are the same. For these fundamental reasons, freedom and democracy will always andeverywhere have greater appeal than the slogans of hatred and the tactics of terror. Success in Iraq could also begin a new stage for Middle Eastern peace, and set in motion progress towards a truly democratic Palestinian state. The passing of Saddam Hussein's regime will deprive terrorist networks of a wealthy patron that pays for terrorist training, and offers rewards to families of suicide bombers. And other regimes will be given a clear warningthat support for terror will not be tolerated. Without this outside support for terrorism, Palestinians who are working for reform and long for democracy will be in a better position to choose new leaders. True leaders who strive for peace; true leaders who faithfully serve the people. A Palestinian state must be a reformedand peaceful state that abandons forever the use of terror. For its part, the new government of Israel -- as the terror threat is removed and security improves -- will be expected to support the creation of a viable Palestinian state and to work as quickly as possible toward a final status agreement. As progress is made toward peace, settlement activity in the occupied territories must end. And the Arab states will be expected to meet their responsibilities to oppose terrorism, to support the emergence of a peaceful anddemocratic Palestine, and state clearly they will live in peace with Israel. The United States and other nations are working on a road map for peace. We are setting out the necessary conditions for progress toward the goal of two states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security. It is the commitment of our government -- and my personal commitment -- to implement the road map and to reach that goal. Old patterns of conflict in the Middle East can be broken, if all concerned will let go of bitterness, hatred, and violence, and get on with the serious work of economic development, and political reform, and reconciliation. America will seize every opportunity in pursuit of peace. And the end of thepresent regime in Iraq would create such an opportunity. In confronting Iraq, the United States is also showing our commitment to effective international institutions. We are a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. We helped to create the Security Council. We believe in the Security Council -- so much thatwe want its words to have meaning. The global threat of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction cannot be confronted by one nation alone. The world needs today and will need tomorrow international bodies with the authority and the will to stop the spread of terror and chemical and biological and nuclear weapons. A threat to all must be answered by all. High-minded pronouncements against proliferation mean little unless the strongest nations are willing to stand behind them -- and use force if necessary. After all, the United Nations was created, as Winston Churchill said, to ""make sure that the force of right will, in the ultimate issue, be protected by the right offorce."" Another resolution is now before the Security Council. If the council responds to Iraq's defiance with more excuses and delays, if all its authority proves to be empty, the United Nations will be severely weakened as a source of stability and order. If the members rise tothis moment, then the Council will fulfill its founding purpose. I've listened carefully, as people and leaders around the world have made known their desire for peace. All of us want peace. The threat to peace does not come from those who seek to enforce the just demands of the civilized world; the threat to peace comes from those who flout those demands. If we have to act, we will act to restrain the violent, and defend the cause of peace. And by acting, we will signal to outlaw regimes that in this new century, theboundaries of civilized behavior will be respected. Protecting those boundaries carries a cost. If war is forced upon us by Iraq's refusal to disarm, we will meet an enemy who hides his military forces behind civilians, who has terrible weapons, who is capable of any crime. The dangers are real, as our soldiers, and sailors, airmen, and Marines fully understand. Yet, no military has ever been better prepared to meetthese challenges. Members of our Armed Forces also understand why they may be called to fight. They know that retreat before a dictator guarantees even greater sacrifices in the future. They know that America's cause is right and just: liberty for an oppressed people, and security for the American people. And I know something about these men and women who wear our uniform:they will complete every mission they are given with skill, and honor, and courage. Much is asked of America in this year 2003. The work ahead is demanding. It will be difficult to help freedom take hold in a country that has known three decades of dictatorship, secret police, internal divisions, and war. It will be difficult to cultivate liberty and peace in the Middle East, after so many generations of strife. Yet, the security of our nation and the hope of millions depend on us, and Americans do not turn away from duties because they are hard.We have met great tests in other times, and we will meet the tests of our time. We go forward with confidence, because we trust in the power of human freedom to change lives and nations. By the resolve and purpose of America, and of our friends and allies, we will make this an age of progress and liberty. Free people will set the course of history, and freepeople will keep the peace of the world. Thank you all, very much.",bush
"My fellow citizens, events in Iraq have now reached the final days of decision. For more than a decade, the United States and other nations have pursued patient and honorable efforts to disarm the Iraqi regime without war. That regime pledged to reveal and destroy all itsweapons of mass destruction as a condition for ending the Persian Gulf War in 1991. Since then, the world has engaged in 12 years of diplomacy. We have passed more than a dozen resolutions in the United Nations Security Council. We have sent hundreds of weaponsinspectors to oversee the disarmament of Iraq. Our good faith has not been returned. The Iraqi regime has used diplomacy as a ploy to gain time and advantage. It has uniformly defied Security Council resolutions demanding full disarmament. Over the years, U.N. weapon inspectors have been threatened by Iraqi officials, electronically bugged, and systematically deceived. Peaceful efforts to disarm the Iraqi regime have failed again and again -- becausewe are not dealing with peaceful men. Intelligence gathered by this and other governments leaves no doubt that the Iraq regime continues to possess and conceal some of the most lethal weapons ever devised. This regime has already used weapons of mass destruction against Iraq's neighbors and against Iraq'speople. The regime has a history of reckless aggression in the Middle East. It has a deep hatred of America and our friends. And it has aided, trained, and harbored terrorists, includingoperatives of al Qaeda. The danger is clear: using chemical, biological, or, one day, nuclear weapons, obtained with the help of Iraq, the terrorists could fulfill their stated ambitions and kill thousands orhundreds of thousands of innocent people in our country, or any other. The United States and other nations did nothing to deserve or invite this threat. But we will do everything to defeat it. Instead of drifting along toward tragedy, we will set a course toward safety. Before the day of horror can come, before it is too late to act, this danger will beremoved. The United States of America has the sovereign authority to use force in assuring its own national security. That duty falls to me, as Commander-in-Chief, by the oath I have sworn, bythe oath I will keep. Recognizing the threat to our country, the United States Congress voted overwhelmingly last year to support the use of force against Iraq. America tried to work with the United Nations to address this threat because we wanted to resolve the issue peacefully. We believe in the mission of the United Nations. One reason the U.N. was founded after the second world war was to confront aggressive dictators, actively and early, before they can attack the innocent and destroy the peace. In the case of Iraq, the Security Council did act, in the early 1990s. Under Resolutions 678 and 687 -- both still in effect -- the United States and our allies are authorized to use force in ridding Iraq of weapons of mass destruction. This is not a question of authority; it is aquestion of will. Last September, I went to the U.N. General Assembly and urged the nations of the world to unite and bring an end to this danger. On November 8th, the Security Council unanimously passed Resolution 1441, finding Iraq in material breach of its obligations, and vowing seriousconsequences if Iraq did not fully and immediately disarm. Today, no nation can possibly claim that Iraq has disarmed. And it will not disarm so long as Saddam Hussein holds power. For the last four-and-a-half months, the United States and our allies have worked within the Security Council to enforce that Council's long-standing demands. Yet, some permanent members of the Security Council have publicly announced they will veto any resolution that compels the disarmament of Iraq. These governments share our assessment of the danger, but not our resolve to meet it. Many nations, however, do have the resolve and fortitude to act against this threat to peace, and a broad coalition is now gathering to enforce the just demands of the world. The United Nations Security Council hasnot lived up to its responsibilities, so we will rise to ours. In recent days, some governments in the Middle East have been doing their part. They have delivered public and private messages urging the dictator to leave Iraq, so that disarmament can proceed peacefully. He has thus far refused. All the decades of deceit and cruelty have now reached an end. Saddam Hussein and his sons must leave Iraq within 48 hours. Their refusal to do so will result in military conflict, commenced at a time of our choosing. For their own safety, all foreign nationals -- including journalists and inspectors -- should leave Iraqimmediately. Many Iraqis can hear me tonight in a translated radio broadcast, and I have a message for them. If we must begin a military campaign, it will be directed against the lawless men who rule your country and not against you. As our coalition takes away their power, we will deliver the food and medicine you need. We will tear down the apparatus of terror and we will help you to build a new Iraq that is prosperous and free. In a free Iraq, there will be no more wars of aggression against your neighbors, no more poison factories, no more executions of dissidents, no more torture chambers and rape rooms. The tyrant will soon be gone. The dayof your liberation is near. It is too late for Saddam Hussein to remain in power. It is not too late for the Iraqi military to act with honor and protect your country by permitting the peaceful entry of coalition forces to eliminate weapons of mass destruction. Our forces will give Iraqi military units clear instructions on actions they can take to avoid being attacked and destroyed. I urge every member of the Iraqi military and intelligence services, if war comes, do not fight for a dyingregime that is not worth your own life. And all Iraqi military and civilian personnel should listen carefully to this warning: In any conflict, your fate will depend on your actions. Do not destroy oil wells, a source of wealth that belongs to the Iraqi people. Do not obey any command to use weapons of mass destruction against anyone, including the Iraqi people. War crimes will be prosecuted. War criminals willbe punished. And it will be no defense to say, ""I was just following orders."" Should Saddam Hussein choose confrontation, the American people can know that every measure has been taken to avoid war, and every measure will be taken to win it. Americans understand the costs of conflict because we have paid them in the past. War has no certainty,except the certainty of sacrifice. Yet, the only way to reduce the harm and duration of war is to apply the full force and might of our military, and we are prepared to do so. If Saddam Hussein attempts to cling to power, he will remain a deadly foe until the end. In desperation, he and terrorists groups might try to conduct terrorist operations against the American people and our friends. These attacks are not inevitable. They are, however, possible. And this very fact underscores the reason we cannot live under the threat of blackmail. The terrorist threat to America and the world will bediminished the moment that Saddam Hussein is disarmed. Our government is on heightened watch against these dangers. Just as we are preparing to ensure victory in Iraq, we are taking further actions to protect our homeland. In recent days, American authorities have expelled from the country certain individuals with ties to Iraqi intelligence services. Among other measures, I have directed additional security of our airports, and increased Coast Guard patrols of major seaports. The Department of Homeland Security is working closely with the nation's governors to increase armed security at criticalfacilities across America. Should enemies strike our country, they would be attempting to shift our attention with panic and weaken our morale with fear. In this, they would fail. No act of theirs can alter the course or shake the resolve of this country. We are a peaceful people -- yet we're not a fragile people, and we will not be intimidated by thugs and killers. If our enemies dare to strike us,they and all who have aided them, will face fearful consequences. We are now acting because the risks of inaction would be far greater. In one year, or five years, the power of Iraq to inflict harm on all free nations would be multiplied many times over. With these capabilities, Saddam Hussein and his terrorist allies could choose the moment of deadly conflict when they are strongest. We choose to meet that threat now,where it arises, before it can appear suddenly in our skies and cities. The cause of peace requires all free nations to recognize new and undeniable realities. In the 20th century, some chose to appease murderous dictators, whose threats were allowed to grow into genocide and global war. In this century, when evil men plot chemical, biological, and nuclear terror, a policy of appeasement could bring destruction of a kind never beforeseen on this earth. Terrorists and terror states do not reveal these threats with fair notice, in formal declarations -- and responding to such enemies only after they have struck first is not self-defense; it issuicide. The security of the world requires disarming Saddam Hussein now. As we enforce the just demands of the world, we will also honor the deepest commitments of our country. Unlike Saddam Hussein, we believe the Iraqi people are deserving and capable of human liberty. And when the dictator has departed, they can set an example to all the MiddleEast of a vital and peaceful and self-governing nation. The United States, with other countries, will work to advance liberty and peace in that region. Our goal will not be achieved overnight, but it can come over time. The power and appeal of human liberty is felt in every life and every land. And the greatest power of freedom is to overcome hatred and violence, and turn the creative gifts of men and women to the pursuitsof peace. That is the future we choose. Free nations have a duty to defend our people by uniting against the violent. And tonight, as we have done before, America and our allies accept thatresponsibility. Good night, and may God continue to bless America.",bush
"My  fellow  citizens,  at  this  hour,  American  and  coalition  forces  are  in  the  early  stages  of   military  operations  to  disarm  Iraq,  to  free  its  people,  and  to  defend  the  world  from  grave   danger.   On  my  orders,  coalition  forces  have  begun  striking  selected  targets  of  military  importance  to   undermine  Saddam  Hussein's  ability  to  wage  war.  These  are  opening  stages  of  what  will  be  a   broad  and  concerted  campaign.  More  than  35  countries  are  giving  crucial  support        from  the   use  of  naval  and  air  bases,  to  help  with  intelligence  and  logistics,  to  the  deployment  of  combat   units.  Every  nation  in  this  coalition  has  chosen  to  bear  the  duty  and  share  the  honor  of  serving   in  our  common  defense.   To  all  the  men  and  women  of  the  United  States  Armed  Forces  now  in  the  Middle  East,  the   peace  of  a  troubled  world  and  the  hopes  of  an  oppressed  people  now  depend  on  you.  That   trust  is  well  placed.   The  enemies  you  confront  will  come  to  know  your  skill  and  bravery.  The  people  you  liberate   will  witness  the  honorable  and  decent  spirit  of  the  American  military.  In  this  conflict,  America   faces  an  enemy  who  has  no  regard  for  conventions  of  war  or  rules  of  morality.  Saddam   Hussein  has  placed  Iraqi  troops  and  equipment  in  civilian  areas,  attempting  to  use  innocent   men,  women  and  children  as  shields  for  his  own  military        a  final  atrocity  against  his  people.    I  want  Americans  and  all  the  world  to  know  that  coalition  forces  will  make  every  effort  to   spare  innocent  civilians  from  harm.  A  campaign  on  the  harsh  terrain  of  a  nation  as  large  as   California  could  be  longer  and  more  difficult  than  some  predict.  And  helping  Iraqis  achieve  a   united,  stable,  and  free  country  will  require  our  sustained  commitment.   We  come  to  Iraq  with  respect  for  its  citizens,  for  their  great  civilization,  and  for  the  religious   faiths  they  practice.  We  have  no  ambition  in  Iraq,  except  to  remove  a  threat  and  restore   control  of  that  country  to  its  own  people.   I  know  that  the  families  of  our  military  are  praying  that  all  those  who  serve  will  return  safely   and  soon.  Millions  of  Americans  are  praying  with  you  for  the  safety  of  your  loved  ones  and  for   the  protection  of  the  innocent.  For  your  sacrifice,  you  have  the  gratitude  and  respect  of  the   American  people.  And  you  can  know  that  our  forces  will  be  coming  home  as  soon  as  their   work  is  done.   Our  nation  enters  this  conflict  reluctantly        yet,  our  purpose  is  sure.  The  people  of  the  United   States  and  our  friends  and  allies  will  not  live  at  the  mercy  of  an  outlaw  regime  that  threatens   the  peace  with  weapons  of  mass  murder.  We  will  meet  that  threat  now,  with  our  Army,  Air   Force,  Navy,  Coast  Guard  and  Marines,  so  that  we  do  not  have  to  meet  it  later  with  armies  of   fire  fighters  and  police  and  doctors  on  the  streets  of  our  cities.   Now  that  conflict  has  come,  the  only  way  to  limit  its  duration  is  to  apply  decisive  force.  And  I   assure  you,  this  will  not  be  a  campaign  of  half  measures,  and  we  will  accept  no  outcome  but   victory.   My  fellow  citizens,  the  dangers  to  our  country  and  the  world  will  be  overcome.  We  will  pass   through  this  time  of  peril  and  carry  on  the  work  of  peace.  We  will  defend  our  freedom.  We  will   bring  freedom  to  others  and  we  will  prevail.   May  God  bless  our  country  and  all  who  defend  her.",bush
"President  Bush:  This  is  George  W  Bush,  the  President  of  the  United  States.  At  this  moment,   the  regime  of  Saddam  Hussein  is  being  removed  from  power,  and  a  long  era  of  fear  and   cruelty  is  ending.  American  and  coalition  forces  are  now  operating  inside  Baghdad        and  we   will  not  stop  until  Saddam   s  corrupt  gang  is  gone.  The  government  of  Iraq,  and  the  future  of   your  country,  will  soon  belong  to  you.   The  goals  of  our  coalition  are  clear  and  limited.  We  will  end  a  brutal  regime,  whose  aggression   and  weapons  of  mass  destruction  make  it  a  unique  threat  to  the  world.  Coalition  forces  will   help  maintain  law  and  order,  so  that  Iraqis  can  live  in  security.  We  will  respect  your  great   religious  traditions,  whose  principles  of  equality  and  compassion  are  essential  to  Iraq   s  future.   We  will  help  you  build  a  peaceful  and  representative  government  that  protects  the  rights  of  all   citizens.  And  then  our  military  forces  will  leave.  Iraq  will  go  forward  as  a  unified,  independent,   and  sovereign  nation  that  has  regained  a  respected  place  in  the  world.   The  United  States  and  its  coalition  partners  respect  the  people  of  Iraq.  We  are  taking   unprecedented  measures  to  spare  the  lives  of  innocent  Iraqi  citizens.  We  are  beginning  to   deliver  food  and  water  and  medicine  to  those  in  need.  Our  only  enemy  is  Saddam  and  his   brutal  regime        and  that  regime  is  your  enemy  as  well.    In  the  new  era  that  is  coming  to  Iraq,  your  country  will  no  longer  be  held  captive  to  the  will  of   a  cruel  dictator.  You  will  be  free,  free  to  build  a  better  life,  instead  of  building  more  palaces  for   Saddam  and  his  sons,  free  to  pursue  economic  prosperity  without  the  hardship  of  economic   sanctions,  free  to  travel  and  free  speak  your  mind,  free  to  join  in  the  political  affairs  of  Iraq.   And  all  the  people  who  make  up  your  country        Kurds,  Shi   a,  Turkomans,  Sunnis,  and  others         will  be  free  of  the  terrible  persecution  that  so  many  have  endured.   The  nightmare  that  Saddam  Hussein  has  brought  to  your  nation  will  soon  be  over.  You  are  a   good  and  gifted  people        the  heirs  of  a  great  civilization  that  contributes  to  all  humanity.  You   deserve  better  than  tyranny  and  corruption  and  torture  chambers.  You  deserve  to  live  as  free   people.  And  I  assure  every  citizen  of  Iraq:  Your  nation  will  soon  be  free.   Thank  you.   Prime  Minister  Blair:  I'm  glad  to  be  able  to  speak  to  you  today  to  tell  you  that  Saddam   Hussein's  regime  is  collapsing    that  the  years  of  brutality,  oppression,  and  fear  are  coming  to   an  end    that  a  new  and  better  future  beckons  for  the  people  of  Iraq.   We  did  not  want  this  war.  But  in  refusing  to  give  up  his  weapons  of  mass  destruction,  Saddam   gave  us  no  choice  but  to  act.  Now  that  the  war  has  begun,  it  will  be  seen  through  to  the  end.   We  will  continue  to  do  all  we  can  to  avoid  civilian  casualties.  Our  enemy  is  Saddam  and  his   regime,  not  the  Iraqi  people.  Our  forces  are  friends  and  liberators  of  the  Iraqi  people,  not  your   conquerors.  And  they  will  not  stay  a  day  longer  in  Iraq  than  is  necessary.   I  know,  however,  that  some  of  you  feared  a  repeat  of  1991,  when  you  thought  Saddam's  rule   was  being  ended,  but  he  stayed,  and  you  suffered.  That  will  not  happen  this  time.  This  regime   will  be  gone,  and  ended.  And  then  we  will  work  with  you  to  build  the  peaceful,  prosperous  Iraq   that  you  want,  and  that  you  deserve.  And  this  Iraq  will  not  be  run  by  Britain,  or  by  the  United   States,  or  by  the  United  Nations.  It  will  be  run  by  you,  the  people  of  Iraq.    Our  aim  is  to  help  alleviate  immediate  humanitarian  suffering,  and  to  move  as  soon  as   possible  to  an  interim  authority  that  is  run  by  Iraqis.  That,  in  turn,  will  pave  the  way  for  a   truly  representative  Iraqi  government,  which  respects  human  rights  and  the  rule  of  law  and   spends  Iraq's  wealth  not  on  palaces  and  weapons  of  mass  destruction,  but  on  you  and  the   services  you  need.  Saddam  Hussein  and  his  regime  plundered  your  nation's  wealth.  While   many  of  you  live  in  poverty,  they  lived  lives  of  luxury.  Saddam  became  one  of  the  richest  men   in  the  world    his  money  stolen  from  you,  the  Iraqi  people.   The  money  from  Iraqi  oil  will  be  yours    to  be  used  to  build  prosperity  for  you  and  your   families.   I  know  too  from  my  meetings  with  Iraqi  exiles  who  live  in  Britain  that  you  are  an  inventive,   creative  people.  You  should  be  free  to  travel,  free  to  have  access  to  independent  media,  free   to  express  your  views,  free  to  develop  your  culture.   My  experience  of  people  the  world  over  is  that  we  all  want  to  be  able  to  live  our  lives  in  peace   and  security    we  all  want  to  give  our  families  the  chance  of  a  decent  life  and  a  future.  For   years,  that  chance  has  been  denied  to  you.  Millions  of  your  countrymen  and  women  have   been  forced  to  leave.  Many  thousands  have  been  murdered,  tortured,  brutalized  by  the   regime.  Now  we  want  to  give  you  the  chance  to  rebuild  your  country    to  rebuild  your  lives    to   give  your  families  a  chance  of  that  better  future.   So  it  is  in  the  spirit  of  friendship  and  goodwill  that  we  now  offer  our  help.   Thank  you.",bush
"Admiral Kelly, Captain Card, officers and sailors of the USS Abraham Lincoln, my fellow Americans: Major combat operations in Iraq have ended. In the battle of Iraq, the United States and our allies have prevailed. And now our coalition is engaged in securing and reconstructing that country. In this battle, we have fought for the cause of liberty, and for the peace of the world. Our nation and our coalition are proud of this accomplishment -- yet, it is you, the members of the United States military, who achieved it. Your courage, your willingness to face danger for your country and for each other, made this day possible. Because of you, our nation is more secure. Because of you, the tyrant has fallen, and Iraq is free. Operation Iraqi Freedom was carried out with a combination of precision and speed and boldness the enemy did not expect, and the world had not seen before. From distant bases or ships at sea, we sent planes and missiles that could destroy an enemy division, or strike a single bunker. Marines and soldiers charged to Baghdad across 350 miles of hostile ground, in one of the swiftest advances of heavy arms in history. You have shown the world the skill and the might of the American Armed Forces. This nation thanks all the members of our coalition who joined in a noble cause. We thank the Armed Forces of the United Kingdom, Australia, and Poland, who shared in the hardships of war. We thank all the citizens of Iraq who welcomed our troops and joined in the liberation of their own country. And tonight, I have a special word for Secretary Rumsfeld, for General Franks, and for all the men and women who wear the uniform of the United States: America is grateful for a job well done. The character of our military through history -- the daring of Normandy, the fierce courage of Iwo Jima, the decency and idealism that turned enemies into allies -- is fully present in this generation. When Iraqi civilians looked into the faces of our servicemen and women, they saw strength and kindness and goodwill. When I look at the members of the United States military, I see the best of our country, and I'm honored to be your Commander-in-Chief. In the images of falling statues, we have witnessed the arrival of a new era. For a hundred of years of war, culminating in the nuclear age, military technology was designed and deployed to inflict casualties on an ever-growing scale. In defeating Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, Allied forces destroyed entire cities, while enemy leaders who started the conflict were safe until the final days. Military power was used to end a regime by breaking a nation. Today, we have the greater power to free a nation by breaking a dangerous and aggressive regime. With new tactics and precision weapons, we can achieve military objectives without directing violence against civilians. No device of man can remove the tragedy from war; yet it is a great moral advance when the guilty have far more to fear from war than the innocent. In the images of celebrating Iraqis, we have also seen the ageless appeal of human freedom. Decades of lies and intimidation could not make the Iraqi people love their oppressors or desire their own enslavement. Men and women in every culture need liberty like they need food and water and air. Everywhere that freedom arrives, humanity rejoices; and everywhere that freedom stirs, let tyrants fear. We have difficult work to do in Iraq. We're bringing order to parts of that country that remain dangerous. We're pursuing and finding leaders of the old regime, who will be held to account for their crimes. We've begun the search for hidden chemical and biological weapons and already know of hundreds of sites that will be investigated. We're helping to rebuild Iraq, where the dictator built palaces for himself, instead of hospitals and schools. And we will stand with the new leaders of Iraq as they establish a government of, by, and for the Iraqi people. The transition from dictatorship to democracy will take time, but it is worth every effort. Our coalition will stay until our work is done. Then we will leave, and we will leave behind a free Iraq. The battle of Iraq is one victory in a war on terror that began on September the 11, 2001 -- and still goes on. That terrible morning, 19 evil men -- the shock troops of a hateful ideology - - gave America and the civilized world a glimpse of their ambitions. They imagined, in the words of one terrorist, that September the 11th would be the ""beginning of the end of America."" By seeking to turn our cities into killing fields, terrorists and their allies believed that they could destroy this nation's resolve, and force our retreat from the world. They have failed. In the battle of Afghanistan, we destroyed the Taliban, many terrorists, and the camps where they trained. We continue to help the Afghan people lay roads, restore hospitals, and educate all of their children. Yet we also have dangerous work to complete. As I speak, a Special Operations task force, led by the 82nd Airborne, is on the trail of the terrorists and those who seek to undermine the free government of Afghanistan. America and our coalition will finish what we have begun. From Pakistan to the Philippines to the Horn of Africa, we are hunting down al Qaeda killers. Nineteen months ago, I pledged that the terrorists would not escape the patient justice of the United States. And as of tonight, nearly one-half of al Qaeda's senior operatives have been captured or killed. The liberation of Iraq is a crucial advance in the campaign against terror. We've removed an ally of al Qaeda, and cut off a source of terrorist funding. And this much is certain: No terrorist network will gain weapons of mass destruction from the Iraqi regime, because the regime is no more. In these 19 months that changed the world, our actions have been focused and deliberate and proportionate to the offense. We have not forgotten the victims of September the 11th -- the last phone calls, the cold murder of children, the searches in the rubble. With those attacks, the terrorists and their supporters declared war on the United States. And war is what they got. Our war against terror is proceeding according to principles that I have made clear to all: Any person involved in committing or planning terrorist attacks against the American people becomes an enemy of this country, and a target of American justice. Any person, organization, or government that supports, protects, or harbors terrorists is complicit in the murder of the innocent, and equally guilty of terrorist crimes. Any outlaw regime that has ties to terrorist groups and seeks or possesses weapons of mass destruction is a grave danger to the civilized world -- and will be confronted. And anyone in the world, including the Arab world, who works and sacrifices for freedom has a loyal friend in the United States of America. Our commitment to liberty is America's tradition -- declared at our founding; affirmed in Franklin Roosevelt's Four Freedoms; asserted in the Truman Doctrine and in Ronald Reagan's challenge to an evil empire. We are committed to freedom in Afghanistan, in Iraq, and in a peaceful Palestine. The advance of freedom is the surest strategy to undermine the appeal of terror in the world. Where freedom takes hold, hatred gives way to hope. When freedom takes hold, men and women turn to the peaceful pursuit of a better life. American values and American interests lead in the same direction: We stand for human liberty. The United States upholds these principles of security and freedom in many ways -- with all the tools of diplomacy, law enforcement, intelligence, and finance. We're working with a broad coalition of nations that understand the threat and our shared responsibility to meet it. The use of force has been -- and remains -- our last resort. Yet all can know, friend and foe alike, that our nation has a mission: We will answer threats to our security, and we will defend the peace. Our mission continues. Al Qaeda is wounded, not destroyed. The scattered cells of the terrorist network still operate in many nations, and we know from daily intelligence that they continue to plot against free people. The proliferation of deadly weapons remains a serious danger. The enemies of freedom are not idle, and neither are we. Our government has taken unprecedented measures to defend the homeland. And we will continue to hunt down the enemy before he can strike. The war on terror is not over; yet it is not endless. We do not know the day of final victory, but we have seen the turning of the tide. No act of the terrorists will change our purpose, or weaken our resolve, or alter their fate. Their cause is lost. Free nations will press on to victory. Other nations in history have fought in foreign lands and remained to occupy and exploit. Americans, following a battle, want nothing more than to return home. And that is your direction tonight. After service in the Afghan -- and Iraqi theaters of war -- after 100,000 miles, on the longest carrier deployment in recent history, you are homeward bound. Some of you will see new family members for the first time -- 150 babies were born while their fathers were on the Lincoln. Your families are proud of you, and your nation will welcome you. We are mindful, as well, that some good men and women are not making the journey home. One of those who fell, Corporal Jason Mileo, spoke to his parents five days before his death. Jason's father said, ""He called us from the center of Baghdad, not to brag, but to tell us he loved us. Our son was a soldier."" Every name, every life is a loss to our military, to our nation, and to the loved ones who grieve. There's no homecoming for these families. Yet we pray, in God's time, their reunion will come. Those we lost were last seen on duty. Their final act on this Earth was to fight a great evil and bring liberty to others. All of you -- all in this generation of our military -- have taken up the highest calling of history. You're defending your country, and protecting the innocent from harm. And wherever you go, you carry a message of hope -- a message that is ancient and ever new. In the words of the prophet Isaiah, ""To the captives, 'come out,' -- and to those in darkness, 'be free.'"" Thank you for serving our country and our cause. May God bless you all, and may God continue to bless America.",bush
"Mr. Secretary General; Mr. President; distinguished delegates; ladies and gentlemen: Twenty- four months ago -- and yesterday in the memory of America -- the center of New York City became a battlefield, and a graveyard, and the symbol of an unfinished war. Since that day, terrorists have struck in Bali, Mombassa, in Casablanca, in Riyadh, in Jakarta, in Jerusalem --measuring the advance of their cause in the chaos and innocent suffering they leave behind. Last month, terrorists brought their war to the United Nations itself. The U.N. headquarters in Baghdad stood for order and compassion -- and for that reason, the terrorists decided it must be destroyed. Among the 22 people who were murdered was Sergio Vieira de Mello. Over the decades, this good and brave man from Brazil gave help to the afflicted in Bangladesh, Cyprus, Mozambique, Lebanon, Cambodia, Central Africa, Kosovo, and East Timor, and was aiding the people of Iraq in their time of need. America joins you, his colleagues, in honoring the memory of Senor Vieira de Mello, and the memory of all who died with him in the serviceto the United Nations. By the victims they choose, and by the means they use, the terrorists have clarified the struggle we are in. Those who target relief workers for death have set themselves against all humanity. Those who incite murder and celebrate suicide reveal their contempt for life, itself. They have no place in any religious faith; they have no claim on the world's sympathy; andthey should have no friend in this chamber. Events during the past two years have set before us the clearest of divides: between those who seek order, and those who spread chaos; between those who work for peaceful change, and those who adopt the methods of gangsters; between those who honor the rights of man, and those who deliberately take the lives of men and women and children without mercy orshame. Between these alternatives there is no neutral ground. All governments that support terror are complicit in a war against civilization. No government should ignore the threat of terror, because to look the other way gives terrorists the chance to regroup and recruit and prepare. And all nations that fight terror, as if the lives of their own people depend on it, will earn thefavorable judgment of history. The former regimes of Afghanistan and Iraq knew these alternatives, and made their choices. The Taliban was a sponsor and servant of terrorism. When confronted, that regime chose defiance, and that regime is no more. Afghanistan's President, who is here today, now represents a free people who are building a decent and just society; they're building a nationfully joined in the war against terror. The regime of Saddam Hussein cultivated ties to terror while it built weapons of mass destruction. It used those weapons in acts of mass murder, and refused to account for them when confronted by the world. The Security Council was right to be alarmed. The Security Council was right to demand that Iraq destroy its illegal weapons and prove that it had done so. The Security Council was right to vow serious consequences if Iraq refused to comply. And because there were consequences, because a coalition of nations acted to defend the peace, and the credibility of the United Nations, Iraq is free, and today we are joined byrepresentatives of a liberated country. Saddam Hussein's monuments have been removed and not only his statues. The true monuments of his rule and his character -- the torture chambers, and the rape rooms, and the prison cells for innocent children -- are closed. And as we discover the killing fields and massgraves of Iraq, the true scale of Saddam's cruelty is being revealed. The Iraqi people are meeting hardships and challenges, like every nation that has set out on the path of democracy. Yet their future promises lives of dignity and freedom, and that is a world away from the squalid, vicious tyranny they have known. Across Iraq, life is being improved by liberty. Across the Middle East, people are safer because an unstable aggressor has been removed from power. Across the world, nations are more secure because an ally ofterror has fallen. Our actions in Afghanistan and Iraq were supported by many governments, and America is grateful to each one. I also recognize that some of the sovereign nations of this assembly disagreed with our actions. Yet there was, and there remains, unity among us on the fundamental principles and objectives of the United Nations. We are dedicated to the defense of our collective security, and to the advance of human rights. These permanent commitmentscall us to great work in the world, work we must do together. So let us move forward. First, we must stand with the people of Afghanistan and Iraq as they build free and stable countries. The terrorists and their allies fear and fight this progress above all, because freepeople embrace hope over resentment, and choose peace over violence. The United Nations has been a friend of the Afghan people, distributing food and medicine, helping refugees return home, advising on a new constitution, and helping to prepare the way for nationwide elections. NATO has taken over the U.N.-mandated security force in Kabul. American and coalition forces continue to track and defeat al Qaeda terrorists and remnants of the Taliban. Our efforts to rebuild that country go on. I have recently proposed to spend an additional $1.2 billion for the Afghan reconstruction effort, and I urge other nations tocontinue contributing to this important cause. In the nation of Iraq, the United Nations is carrying out vital and effective work every day. By the end of 2004, more than 90 percent of Iraqi children under age five will have been immunized against preventable diseases such as polio, tuberculosis and measles, thanks to the hard work and high ideals of UNICEF. Iraq's food distribution system is operational, delivering nearly a half-million tons of food permonth, thanks to the skill and expertise of the World Food Program. Our international coalition in Iraq is meeting it responsibilities. We are conducting precision raids against terrorists and holdouts of the former regime. These killers are at war with the Iraqi people. They have made Iraq the central front in the war on terror, and they will be defeated. Our coalition has made sure that Iraq's former dictator will never again use weapons of mass destruction. We are interviewing Iraqi citizens and analyzing records of the old regime to reveal the full extent of its weapons programs and its long campaign of deception. We're training Iraqi police and border guards and a new army, so the Iraqi peoplecan assume full responsibility for their own security. And at the same time, our coalition is helping to improve the daily lives of the Iraqi people. The old regime built palaces while letting schools decay, so we are rebuilding more than a thousand schools. The old regime starved hospitals of resources, so we have helped to supply and reopen hospitals across Iraq. The old regime built up armies and weapons, while allowing the nation's infrastructure to crumble, so we are rehabilitating power plants, water and sanitation facilities, bridges and airports. I proposed to Congress that the United States provide additional funding for our work in Iraq, the greatest financial commitment of its kind since the Marshall Plan. Having helped to liberate Iraq, we will honor our pledges to Iraq, and by helping the Iraqi people build a stable and peaceful country, we will make our owncountries more secure. The primary goal of our coalition in Iraq is self-government for the people of Iraq, reached by orderly and democratic process. This process must unfold according to the needs of Iraqis, neither hurried, nor delayed by the wishes of other parties. And the United Nations can contribute greatly to the cause of Iraq self-government. America is working with friends and allies on a new Security Council resolution, which will expand the U.N.'s role in Iraq. As in the aftermath of other conflicts, the United Nations should assist in developing a constitution, intraining civil servants, and conducting free and fair elections. Iraq now has a Governing Council, the first truly representative institution in that country. Iraq's new leaders are showing the openness and tolerance that democracy requires, and they're also showing courage. Yet every young democracy needs the help of friends. Now the nation of Iraq needs anddeserves our aid, and all nations of goodwill should step forward and provide that support. The success of a free Iraq will be watched and noted throughout the region. Millions will see that freedom, equality, and material progress are possible at the heart of the Middle East. Leaders in the region will face the clearest evidence that free institutions and open societies are the only path to long-term national success and dignity. And a transformed Middle East would benefit the entire world, by undermining the ideologies that export violence to otherlands. Iraq as a dictatorship had great power to destabilize the Middle East; Iraq as a democracy will have great power to inspire the Middle East. The advance of democratic institutions in Iraq is setting an example that others, including the Palestinian people, would be wise to follow. The Palestinian cause is betrayed by leaders who cling to power by feeding old hatreds and destroying the good work of others. The Palestinian people deserve their own state, and they will gain that state by embracing new leaders committed to reform, to fighting terror, and to building peace. All parties in the Middle East must meet their responsibilities and carry out the commitments they made at Aqaba. Israel must work to create the conditions that will allow a peaceful Palestinian state to emerge. And Arab nations must cut off funding and other support for terrorist organizations. America will work with every nation in the region that acts boldlyfor the sake of peace. A second challenge we must confront together is the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Outlaw regimes that possess nuclear, chemical and biological weapons -- and the means to deliver them -- would be able to use blackmail and create chaos in entire regions. These weapons could be used by terrorists to bring sudden disaster and suffering on a scale we can scarcely imagine. The deadly combination of outlaw regimes and terror networks and weapons of mass murder is a peril that cannot be ignored or wished away. If such a danger is allowed to fully materialize, all words, all protests, will come too late. Nations of the worldmust have the wisdom and the will to stop grave threats before they arrive. One crucial step is to secure the most dangerous materials at their source. For more than a decade, the United States has worked with Russia and other states of the former Soviet Union to dismantle, destroy, or secure weapons and dangerous materials left over from another era. Last year in Canada, the G8 nations agreed to provide up to $20 billion -- half of it from the United States -- to fight this proliferation risk over the next 10 years. Since then, six additional countries have joined the effort. More are needed, and I urge other nations to helpus meet this danger. We're also improving our capability to interdict lethal materials in transit. Through our Proliferation Security Initiative, 11 nations are preparing to search planes and ships, trains and trucks carrying suspect cargo, and to seize weapons or missile shipments that raise proliferation concerns. These nations have agreed on a set of interdiction principles, consistent with legal -- current legal authorities. And we're working to expand the Proliferation Security Initiative to other countries. We're determined to keep the world's most destructive weaponsaway from all our shores, and out of the hands of our common enemies. Because proliferators will use any route or channel that is open to them, we need the broadest possible cooperation to stop them. Today, I ask the U.N. Security Council to adopt a new anti- proliferation resolution. This resolution should call on all members of the U.N. to criminalize the proliferation of weapons -- weapons of mass destruction, to enact strict export controls consistent with international standards, and to secure any and all sensitive materials within their own borders. The United States stands ready to help any nation draft these new laws,and to assist in their enforcement. A third challenge we share is a challenge to our conscience. We must act decisively to meet the humanitarian crises of our time. The United States has begun to carry out the Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, aimed at preventing AIDS on a massive scale, and treating millions who have the disease already. We have pledged $15 billion over five years to fight AIDS aroundthe world. My country is acting to save lives from famine, as well. We're providing more than $1.4 billion in global emergency food aid, and I've asked our United States Congress for $200 million for a new famine fund, so we can act quickly when the first signs of famine appear. Every nation on every continent should generously add their resources to the fight against disease anddesperate hunger. There's another humanitarian crisis spreading, yet hidden from view. Each year, an estimated 800,000 to 900,000 human beings are bought, sold or forced across the world's borders. Among them are hundreds of thousands of teenage girls, and others as young as five, who fall victim to the sex trade. This commerce in human life generates billions of dollars each year --much of which is used to finance organized crime. There's a special evil in the abuse and exploitation of the most innocent and vulnerable. The victims of sex trade see little of life before they see the very worst of life -- an underground of brutality and lonely fear. Those who create these victims and profit from their suffering must be severely punished. Those who patronize this industry debase themselves and deepen themisery of others. And governments that tolerate this trade are tolerating a form of slavery. This problem has appeared in my own country, and we are working to stop it. The PROTECT Act, which I signed into law this year, makes it a crime for any person to enter the United States, or for any citizen to travel abroad, for the purpose of sex tourism involving children. The Department of Justice is actively investigating sex tour operators and patrons, who can face up to 30 years in prison. Under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, the United States isusing sanctions against governments to discourage human trafficking. The victims of this industry also need help from members of the United Nations. And this begins with clear standards and the certainty of punishment under laws of every country. Today, some nations make it a crime to sexually abuse children abroad. Such conduct should be a crime in all nations. Governments should inform travelers of the harm this industry does, and the severe punishments that will fall on its patrons. The American government is committing $50 million to support the good work of organizations that are rescuing women and children from exploitation, and giving them shelter and medical treatment and the hopeof a new life. I urge other governments to do their part. We must show new energy in fighting back an old evil. Nearly two centuries after the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade, and more than a century after slavery was officially ended in its last strongholds, the trade in human beings for any purpose must not be allowed to thrivein our time. All the challenges I have spoken of this morning require urgent attention and moral clarity. Helping Afghanistan and Iraq to succeed as free nations in a transformed region, cutting off the avenues of proliferation, abolishing modern forms of slavery -- these are the kinds of great tasks for which the United Nations was founded. In each case, careful discussion is needed, and also decisive action. Our good intentions will be credited only if we achieve goodoutcomes. As an original signer of the U.N. Charter, the United States of America is committed to the United Nations. And we show that commitment by working to fulfill the U.N.'s stated purposes, and give meaning to its ideals. The founding documents of the United Nations and the founding documents of America stand in the same tradition. Both assert that human beings should never be reduced to objects of power or commerce, because their dignity is inherent. Both require -- both recognize a moral law that stands above men and nations, which must be defended and enforced by men and nations. And both point the way to peace, the peace that comes when all are free. We secure that peace with our courage, and we mustshow that courage together. May God bless you all.",bush
"Thank you all very much. Please be seated. Thanks for the warm welcome, and thanks forinviting me to join you in this 20th anniversary of the National Endowment for Democracy.The staff and directors of this organization have seen a lot of history over the last twodecades, you've been a part of that history. By speaking for and standing for freedom, you'velifted the hopes of people around the world, and you've brought great credit to America. I appreciate Vin for the short introduction. I'm a man who likes short introductions. And hedidn't let me down. But more importantly, I appreciate the invitation. I appreciate themembers of Congress who are here, senators from both political parties, members of theHouse of Representatives from both political parties. I appreciate the ambassadors who arehere. I appreciate the guests who have come. I appreciate the bipartisan spirit, thenonpartisan spirit of the National Endowment for Democracy. I'm glad that Republicans andDemocrats and independents are working together to advance human liberty. The roots of our democracy can be traced to England, and to its Parliament -- and so can theroots of this organization. In June of 1982, President Ronald Reagan spoke at WestminsterPalace and declared, the turning point had arrived in history. He argued that Sovietcommunism had failed, precisely because it did not respect its own people -- their creativity,their genius and their rights. President Reagan said that the day of Soviet tyranny was passing, that freedom had amomentum which would not be halted. He gave this organization its mandate: to add to themomentum of freedom across the world. Your mandate was important 20 years ago; it isequally important today. A number of critics were dismissive of that speech by the President. According to one editorialof the time, ""It seems hard to be a sophisticated European and also an admirer of RonaldReagan."" Some observers on both sides of the Atlantic pronounced the speech simplistic andnaive, and even dangerous. In fact, Ronald Reagan's words were courageous and optimisticand entirely correct. The great democratic movement President Reagan described was already well underway. Inthe early 1970s, there were about 40 democracies in the world. By the middle of that decade,Portugal and Spain and Greece held free elections. Soon there were new democracies in LatinAmerica, and free institutions were spreading in Korea, in Taiwan, and in East Asia. This veryweek in 1989, there were protests in East Berlin and in Leipzig. By the end of that year, everycommunist dictatorship in Central America* had collapsed. Within another year, the SouthAfrican government released Nelson Mandela. Four years later, he was elected president of hiscountry -- ascending, like Walesa and Havel, from prisoner of state to head of state. As the 20th century ended, there were around 120 democracies in the world -- and I canassure you more are on the way. Ronald Reagan would be pleased, and he would not besurprised. We've witnessed, in little over a generation, the swiftest advance of freedom in the 2,500 yearstory of democracy. Historians in the future will offer their own explanations for why thishappened. Yet we already know some of the reasons they will cite. It is no accident that therise of so many democracies took place in a time when the world's most influential nation wasitself a democracy. The United States made military and moral commitments in Europe and Asia, which protectedfree nations from aggression, and created the conditions in which new democracies couldflourish. As we provided security for whole nations, we also provided inspiration for oppressedpeoples. In prison camps, in banned union meetings, in clandestine churches, men andwomen knew that the whole world was not sharing their own nightmare. They knew of at leastone place -- a bright and hopeful land -- where freedom was valued and secure. And theyprayed that America would not forget them, or forget the mission to promote liberty aroundthe world. Historians will note that in many nations, the advance of markets and free enterprise helpedto create a middle class that was confident enough to demand their own rights. They will pointto the role of technology in frustrating censorship and central control -- and marvel at thepower of instant communications to spread the truth, the news, and courage across borders. Historians in the future will reflect on an extraordinary, undeniable fact: Over time, freenations grow stronger and dictatorships grow weaker. In the middle of the 20th century, someimagined that the central planning and social regimentation were a shortcut to nationalstrength. In fact, the prosperity, and social vitality and technological progress of a people aredirectly determined by extent of their liberty. Freedom honors and unleashes human creativity-- and creativity determines the strength and wealth of nations. Liberty is both the plan ofHeaven for humanity, and the best hope for progress here on Earth. The progress of liberty is a powerful trend. Yet, we also know that liberty, if not defended, canbe lost. The success of freedom is not determined by some dialectic of history. By definition,the success of freedom rests upon the choices and the courage of free peoples, and upon theirwillingness to sacrifice. In the trenches of World War I, through a two-front war in the 1940s,the difficult battles of Korea and Vietnam, and in missions of rescue and liberation on nearlyevery continent, Americans have amply displayed our willingness to sacrifice for liberty. The sacrifices of Americans have not always been recognized or appreciated, yet they havebeen worthwhile. Because we and our allies were steadfast, Germany and Japan aredemocratic nations that no longer threaten the world. A global nuclear standoff with theSoviet Union ended peacefully -- as did the Soviet Union. The nations of Europe are movingtowards unity, not dividing into armed camps and descending into genocide. Every nation haslearned, or should have learned, an important lesson: Freedom is worth fighting for, dying for,and standing for -- and the advance of freedom leads to peace. And now we must apply that lesson in our own time. We've reached another great turningpoint -- and the resolve we show will shape the next stage of the world democraticmovement. Our commitment to democracy is tested in countries like Cuba and Burma and North Koreaand Zimbabwe -- outposts of oppression in our world. The people in these nations live incaptivity, and fear and silence. Yet, these regimes cannot hold back freedom forever -- and,one day, from prison camps and prison cells, and from exile, the leaders of new democracieswill arrive. Communism, and militarism and rule by the capricious and corrupt are the relics ofa passing era. And we will stand with these oppressed peoples until the day of their freedomfinally arrives. Our commitment to democracy is tested in China. That nation now has a sliver, a fragment ofliberty. Yet, China's people will eventually want their liberty pure and whole. China hasdiscovered that economic freedom leads to national wealth. China's leaders will also discoverthat freedom is indivisible -- that social and religious freedom is also essential to nationalgreatness and national dignity. Eventually, men and women who are allowed to control theirown wealth will insist on controlling their own lives and their own country. Our commitment to democracy is also tested in the Middle East, which is my focus today, andmust be a focus of American policy for decades to come. In many nations of the Middle East --countries of great strategic importance -- democracy has not yet taken root. And thequestions arise: Are the peoples of the Middle East somehow beyond the reach of liberty? Aremillions of men and women and children condemned by history or culture to live indespotism? Are they alone never to know freedom, and never even to have a choice in thematter? I, for one, do not believe it. I believe every person has the ability and the right to befree. Some skeptics of democracy assert that the traditions of Islam are inhospitable to therepresentative government. This ""cultural condescension,"" as Ronald Reagan termed it, has along history. After the Japanese surrender in 1945, a so-called Japan expert asserted thatdemocracy in that former empire would ""never work."" Another observer declared theprospects for democracy in post-Hitler Germany are, and I quote, ""most uncertain at best"" --he made that claim in 1957. Seventy-four years ago, The Sunday London Times declarednine-tenths of the population of India to be ""illiterates not caring a fig for politics."" Yet whenIndian democracy was imperiled in the 1970s, the Indian people showed their commitment toliberty in a national referendum that saved their form of government. Time after time, observers have questioned whether this country, or that people, or thisgroup, are ""ready"" for democracy -- as if freedom were a prize you win for meeting our ownWestern standards of progress. In fact, the daily work of democracy itself is the path ofprogress. It teaches cooperation, the free exchange of ideas, and the peaceful resolution ofdifferences. As men and women are showing, from Bangladesh to Botswana, to Mongolia, it isthe practice of democracy that makes a nation ready for democracy, and every nation canstart on this path. It should be clear to all that Islam -- the faith of one-fifth of humanity -- is consistent withdemocratic rule. Democratic progress is found in many predominantly Muslim countries -- inTurkey and Indonesia, and Senegal and Albania, Niger and Sierra Leone. Muslim men andwomen are good citizens of India and South Africa, of the nations of Western Europe, and ofthe United States of America. More than half of all the Muslims in the world live in freedom under democratically constitutedgovernments. They succeed in democratic societies, not in spite of their faith, but because ofit. A religion that demands individual moral accountability, and encourages the encounter ofthe individual with God, is fully compatible with the rights and responsibilities of self- government. Yet there's a great challenge today in the Middle East. In the words of a recent report by Arabscholars, the global wave of democracy has -- and I quote -- ""barely reached the Arab states.""They continue: ""This freedom deficit undermines human development and is one of the mostpainful manifestations of lagging political development."" The freedom deficit they describe has terrible consequences, of the people of the Middle Eastand for the world. In many Middle Eastern countries, poverty is deep and it is spreading,women lack rights and are denied schooling. Whole societies remain stagnant while the worldmoves ahead. These are not the failures of a culture or a religion. These are the failures ofpolitical and economic doctrines. As the colonial era passed away, the Middle East saw the establishment of many militarydictatorships. Some rulers adopted the dogmas of socialism, seized total control of politicalparties and the media and universities. They allied themselves with the Soviet bloc and withinternational terrorism. Dictators in Iraq and Syria promised the restoration of national honor,a return to ancient glories. They've left instead a legacy of torture, oppression, misery, andruin. Other men, and groups of men, have gained influence in the Middle East and beyond throughan ideology of theocratic terror. Behind their language of religion is the ambition for absolutepolitical power. Ruling cabals like the Taliban show their version of religious piety in publicwhippings of women, ruthless suppression of any difference or dissent, and support forterrorists who arm and train to murder the innocent. The Taliban promised religious purity andnational pride. Instead, by systematically destroying a proud and working society, they leftbehind suffering and starvation. Many Middle Eastern governments now understand that military dictatorship and theocraticrule are a straight, smooth highway to nowhere. But some governments still cling to the oldhabits of central control. There are governments that still fear and repress independentthought and creativity, and private enterprise -- the human qualities that make for a -- strongand successful societies. Even when these nations have vast natural resources, they do notrespect or develop their greatest resources -- the talent and energy of men and womenworking and living in freedom. Instead of dwelling on past wrongs and blaming others, governments in the Middle East needto confront real problems, and serve the true interests of their nations. The good and capablepeople of the Middle East all deserve responsible leadership. For too long, many people in thatregion have been victims and subjects -- they deserve to be active citizens. Governments across the Middle East and North Africa are beginning to see the need forchange. Morocco has a diverse new parliament; King Mohammed has urged it to extend therights to women. Here is how His Majesty explained his reforms to parliament: ""How cansociety achieve progress while women, who represent half the nation, see their rights violatedand suffer as a result of injustice, violence, and marginalization, notwithstanding the dignityand justice granted to them by our glorious religion?"" The King of Morocco is correct: Thefuture of Muslim nations will be better for all with the full participation of women. In Bahrain last year, citizens elected their own parliament for the first time in nearly threedecades. Oman has extended the vote to all adult citizens; Qatar has a new constitution;Yemen has a multiparty political system; Kuwait has a directly elected national assembly; andJordan held historic elections this summer. Recent surveys in Arab nations reveal broadsupport for political pluralism, the rule of law, and free speech. These are the stirrings ofMiddle Eastern democracy, and they carry the promise of greater change to come. As changes come to the Middle Eastern region, those with power should ask themselves: Willthey be remembered for resisting reform, or for leading it? In Iran, the demand for democracyis strong and broad, as we saw last month when thousands gathered to welcome home ShirinEbadi, the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. The regime in Teheran must heed the democraticdemands of the Iranian people, or lose its last claim to legitimacy. For the Palestinian people, the only path to independence and dignity and progress is the pathof democracy. And the Palestinian leaders who block and undermine democratic reform, andfeed hatred and encourage violence are not leaders at all. They're the main obstacles topeace, and to the success of the Palestinian people. The Saudi government is taking first steps toward reform, including a plan for gradualintroduction of elections. By giving the Saudi people a greater role in their own society, theSaudi government can demonstrate true leadership in the region. The great and proud nation of Egypt has shown the way toward peace in the Middle East, andnow should show the way toward democracy in the Middle East. Champions of democracy inthe region understand that democracy is not perfect, it is not the path to utopia, but it's theonly path to national success and dignity. As we watch and encourage reforms in the region, we are mindful that modernization is notthe same as Westernization. Representative governments in the Middle East will reflect theirown cultures. They will not, and should not, look like us. Democratic nations may beconstitutional monarchies, federal republics, or parliamentary systems. And workingdemocracies always need time to develop -- as did our own. We've taken a 200-year journeytoward inclusion and justice -- and this makes us patient and understanding as other nationsare at different stages of this journey. There are, however, essential principles common to every successful society, in every culture.Successful societies limit the power of the state and the power of the military -- so thatgovernments respond to the will of the people, and not the will of an elite. Successful societiesprotect freedom with the consistent and impartial rule of law, instead of selecting applying --selectively applying the law to punish political opponents. Successful societies allow room forhealthy civic institutions -- for political parties and labor unions and independent newspapersand broadcast media. Successful societies guarantee religious liberty -- the right to serve andhonor God without fear of persecution. Successful societies privatize their economies, andsecure the rights of property. They prohibit and punish official corruption, and invest in the health and education of theirpeople. They recognize the rights of women. And instead of directing hatred and resentmentagainst others, successful societies appeal to the hopes of their own people. These vital principles are being applies in the nations of Afghanistan and Iraq. With the steadyleadership of President Karzai, the people of Afghanistan are building a modern and peacefulgovernment. Next month, 500 delegates will convene a national assembly in Kabul to approvea new Afghan constitution. The proposed draft would establish a bicameral parliament, setnational elections next year, and recognize Afghanistan's Muslim identity, while protecting therights of all citizens. Afghanistan faces continuing economic and security challenges -- it willface those challenges as a free and stable democracy. In Iraq, the Coalition Provisional Authority and the Iraqi Governing Council are also workingtogether to build a democracy -- and after three decades of tyranny, this work is not easy.The former dictator ruled by terror and treachery, and left deeply ingrained habits of fear anddistrust. Remnants of his regime, joined by foreign terrorists, continue their battle againstorder and against civilization. Our coalition is responding to recent attacks with precisionraids, guided by intelligence provided by the Iraqis, themselves. And we're working closelywith Iraqi citizens as they prepare a constitution, as they move toward free elections and takeincreasing responsibility for their own affairs. As in the defense of Greece in 1947, and later inthe Berlin Airlift, the strength and will of free peoples are now being tested before a watchingworld. And we will meet this test. Securing democracy in Iraq is the work of many hands. American and coalition forces aresacrificing for the peace of Iraq and for the security of free nations. Aid workers from manycountries are facing danger to help the Iraqi people. The National Endowment for Democracyis promoting women's rights, and training Iraqi journalists, and teaching the skills of politicalparticipation. Iraqis, themselves -- police and borders guards and local officials -- are joiningin the work and they are sharing in the sacrifice. This is a massive and difficult undertaking -- it is worth our effort, it is worth our sacrifice,because we know the stakes. The failure of Iraqi democracy would embolden terrorists aroundthe world, increase dangers to the American people, and extinguish the hopes of millions inthe region. Iraqi democracy will succeed -- and that success will send forth the news, fromDamascus to Teheran -- that freedom can be the future of every nation. The establishment ofa free Iraq at the heart of the Middle East will be a watershed event in the global democraticrevolution. Sixty years of Western nations excusing and accommodating the lack of freedom in the MiddleEast did nothing to make us safe -- because in the long run, stability cannot be purchased atthe expense of liberty. As long as the Middle East remains a place where freedom does notflourish, it will remain a place of stagnation, resentment, and violence ready for export. Andwith the spread of weapons that can bring catastrophic harm to our country and to ourfriends, it would be reckless to accept the status quo. Therefore, the United States has adopted a new policy, a forward strategy of freedom in theMiddle East. This strategy requires the same persistence and energy and idealism we haveshown before. And it will yield the same results. As in Europe, as in Asia, as in every region ofthe world, the advance of freedom leads to peace. The advance of freedom is the calling of our time; it is the calling of our country. From theFourteen Points to the Four Freedoms, to the Speech at Westminster, America has put ourpower at the service of principle. We believe that liberty is the design of nature; we believethat liberty is the direction of history. We believe that human fulfillment and excellence comein the responsible exercise of liberty. And we believe that freedom -- the freedom we prize --is not for us alone, it is the right and the capacity of all mankind. Working for the spread of freedom can be hard. Yet, America has accomplished hard tasksbefore. Our nation is strong; we're strong of heart. And we're not alone. Freedom is findingallies in every country; freedom finds allies in every culture. And as we meet the terror andviolence of the world, we can be certain the author of freedom is not indifferent to the fate offreedom. With all the tests and all the challenges of our age, this is, above all, the age of liberty. Eachof you at this Endowment is fully engaged in the great cause of liberty. And I thank you. May God bless your work. And may God continue to bless America.",bush
"Thank you very much. Secretary Straw and Secretary Hoon; Admiral Cobbald and Dr. Chipman; distinguished guests: I want to thank you for your very kind welcome that you've given to me and to Laura. I also thank the groups hosting this event -- The Royal United Services Institute, and the International Institute for Strategic Studies. We're honored to be in the United Kingdom, andwe bring the good wishes of the American people. It was pointed out to me that the last noted American to visit London stayed in a glass box dangling over the Thames. A few might have been happy to provide similar arrangements forme. I thank Her Majesty the Queen for interceding. We're honored to be staying at her house. Americans traveling to England always observe more similarities to our country than differences. I've been here only a short time, but I've noticed that the tradition of free speech -- exercised with enthusiasm -- is alive and well here in London. We have that at home, too.They now have that right in Baghdad, as well. The people of Great Britain also might see some familiar traits in Americans. We're sometimes faulted for a naive faith that liberty can change the world. If that's an error it began with reading too much John Locke and Adam Smith. Americans have, on occasion, been called moralists who often speak in terms of right and wrong. That zeal has been inspired by examples on this island, by the tireless compassion of Lord Shaftesbury, the righteous courage of Wilberforce, and the firm determination of the Royal Navy over the decades tofight and end the trade in slaves. It's rightly said that Americans are a religious people. That's, in part, because of the ""Good News"" was translated by Tyndale, preached by Wesley, lived out in the example of William Booth. At times, Americans are even said to have a puritan streak. And where might that havecome from? Well, we can start with the Puritans. To this fine heritage, Americans have added a few traits of our own: the good influence of our immigrants, the spirit of the frontier. Yet, there remains a bit of England in every American.So much of our national character comes from you, and we're glad for it. The fellowship of generations is the cause of common beliefs. We believe in open societies ordered by moral conviction. We believe in private markets, humanized by compassionate government. We believe in economies that reward effort, communities that protect the weak, and the duty of nations to respect the dignity and the rights of all. And whether one learns these ideals in County Durham or in West Texas, they instill mutual respect and they inspire common purpose. More than an alliance of security and commerce, the British and Americanpeoples have an alliance of values. And, today, this old and tested alliance is very strong. The deepest beliefs of our nations set the direction of our foreign policy. We value our own civil rights, so we stand for the human rights of others. We affirm the God-given dignity of every person, so we are moved to action by poverty and oppression and famine and disease. The United States and Great Britain share a mission in the world beyond the balance of power or the simple pursuit of interest. We seek the advance of freedom and the peace that freedom brings. Together our nations are standing and sacrificing for this high goal in a distant land at this very hour. And America honors the idealism and the bravery of the sons and daughters ofBritain. The last President to stay at Buckingham Palace was an idealist, without question. At a dinner hosted by King George V, in 1918, Woodrow Wilson made a pledge; with typical American understatement, he vowed that right and justice would become the predominant andcontrolling force in the world. President Wilson had come to Europe with his 14 Points for Peace. Many complimented him on his vision; yet some were dubious. Take, for example, the Prime Minister of France. Hecomplained that God, himself, had only 10 commandments. Sounds familiar. At Wilson's high point of idealism, however, Europe was one short generation from Munich and Auschwitz and the Blitz. Looking back, we see the reasons why. The League of Nations, lacking both credibility and will, collapsed at the first challenge of the dictators. Free nations failed to recognize, much less confront, the aggressive evil in plain sight. And so, dictators went about their business, feeding resentments and anti-Semitism, bringing death to innocent people in this city and across the world, and filling the last century with violence andgenocide. Through world war and cold war, we learned that idealism, if it is to do any good in this world, requires common purpose and national strength, moral courage and patience in difficult tasks.And now our generation has need of these qualities. On September the 11th, 2001, terrorists left their mark of murder on my country, and took the lives of 67 British citizens. With the passing of months and years, it is the natural human desire to resume a quiet life and to put that day behind us, as if waking from a dark dream. The hope that danger has passed is comforting, is understanding, and it is false. The attacks that followed -- on Bali, Jakarta, Casablanca, Bombay, Mombassa, Najaf, Jerusalem, Riyadh, Baghdad, and Istanbul -- were not dreams. They're part of a global campaign by terroristnetworks to intimidate and demoralize all who oppose them. These terrorists target the innocent, and they kill by the thousands. And they would, if they gain the weapons they seek, kill by the millions and not be finished. The greatest threat of our age is nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons in the hands of terrorists, and the dictators who aid them. The evil is in plain sight. The danger only increases with denial. Great responsibilities fall once again to the great democracies. We will face these threats with openeyes, and we will defeat them. The peace and security of free nations now rests on three pillars: First, international organizations must be equal to the challenges facing our world, from lifting up failing states toopposing proliferation. Like 11 Presidents before me, I believe in the international institutions and alliances that America helped to form and helps to lead. The United States and Great Britain have labored hard to help make the United Nations what it is supposed to be -- an effective instrument of our collective security. In recent months, we've sought and gained three additional resolutions on Iraq -- Resolutions 1441, 1483, and 1511 -- precisely because the global danger of terror demands a global response. The United Nations has no more compelling advocate than your Prime Minister, who at every turn has championed its ideals and appealed to its authority. He understands, as well, that the credibility of the U.N. depends on a willingness to keep its wordand to act when action is required. America and Great Britain have done, and will do, all in their power to prevent the United Nations from solemnly choosing its own irrelevance and inviting the fate of the League of Nations. It's not enough to meet the dangers of the world with resolutions; we must meetthose dangers with resolve. In this century, as in the last, nations can accomplish more together than apart. For 54 years, America has stood with our partners in NATO, the most effective multilateral institution in history. We're committed to this great democratic alliance, and we believe it must have thewill and the capacity to act beyond Europe where threats emerge. My nation welcomes the growing unity of Europe, and the world needs America and the European Union to work in common purpose for the advance of security and justice. America is cooperating with four other nations to meet the dangers posed by North Korea. Americabelieves the IAEA must be true to its purpose and hold Iran to its obligations. Our first choice, and our constant practice, is to work with other responsible governments. We understand, as well, that the success of multilateralism is not measured by adherence to forms alone -- the tidiness of the process -- but by the results we achieve to keep our nationssecure. The second pillar of peace and security in our world is the willingness of free nations, when the last resort arrives, to retain* [sic] aggression and evil by force. There are principled objections to the use of force in every generation, and I credit the good motives behind theseviews. Those in authority, however, are not judged only by good motivations. The people have given us the duty to defend them. And that duty sometimes requires the violent restraint of violent men. In some cases, the measured use of force is all that protects us from a chaotic worldruled by force. Most in the peaceful West have no living memory of that kind of world. Yet in some countries, the memories are recent: The victims of ethnic cleansing in the Balkans, those who survived the rapists and the death squads, have few qualms when NATO applied force to help end those crimes. The women of Afghanistan, imprisoned in their homes and beaten in the streets and executed in public spectacles, did not reproach us for routing the Taliban. The inhabitants of Iraq's Baathist hell, with its lavish palaces and its torture chambers, with its massive statutes** [sic] and its mass graves, do not miss their fugitive dictator. They rejoiced at hisfall. In all these cases, military action was proceeded by diplomatic initiatives and negotiations and ultimatums, and final chances until the final moment. In Iraq, year after year, the dictator was given the chance to account for his weapons programs, and end the nightmare for his people.Now, the resolutions he defied have been enforced. And who will say that Iraq was better off when Saddam Hussein was strutting and killing, or that the world was safer when he held power? Who doubts that Afghanistan is a more just society and less dangerous without Mullah Omar playing host to terrorists from around the world. And Europe, too, is plainly better off with Milosevic answering for his crimes, instead ofcommitting more. It's been said that those who live near a police station find it hard to believe in the triumph of violence. In the same way free peoples might be tempted to take for granted the orderly societies we have come to know. Europe's peaceful unity is one of the great achievements of the last half-century. And because European countries now resolve differences through negotiation and consensus, there's sometimes an assumption that the entire world functions in the same way. But let us never forget how Europe's unity was achieved -- by allied armies of liberation and NATO armies of defense. And let us never forget, beyond Europe's borders, in a world where oppression and violence are very real, liberation is still a moral goal, and freedom and securitystill need defenders. The third pillar of security is our commitment to the global expansion of democracy, and the hope and progress it brings, as the alternative to instability and hatred and terror. We cannot rely exclusively on military power to assure our long-term security. Lasting peace is gained asjustice and democracy advance. In democratic and successful societies, men and women do not swear allegiance to malcontents and murderers; they turn their hearts and labor to building better lives. And democratic governments do not shelter terrorist camps or attack their peaceful neighbors; they honor the aspirations and dignity of their own people. In our conflict with terror and tyranny, we have an unmatched advantage, a power that cannot be resisted, and that is theappeal of freedom to all mankind. As global powers, both our nations serve the cause of freedom in many ways, in many places. By promoting development, and fighting famine and AIDS and other diseases, we're fulfilling our moral duties, as well as encouraging stability and building a firmer basis for democratic institutions. By working for justice in Burma, in the Sudan and in Zimbabwe, we give hope to suffering people and improve the chances for stability and progress. By extending the reach of trade we foster prosperity and the habits of liberty. And by advancing freedom in the greater Middle East, we help end a cycle of dictatorship and radicalism that brings millions to [sic]people to misery and brings danger to our own people. The stakes in that region could not be higher. If the Middle East remains a place where freedom does not flourish, it will remain a place of stagnation and anger and violence for export. And as we saw in the ruins of two towers, no distance on the map will protect our lives and way of life. If the greater Middle East joins the democratic revolution that has reached much of the world, the lives of millions in that region will be bettered, and a trend of conflictand fear will be ended at its source. The movement of history will not come about quickly. Because of our own democratic development -- the fact that it was gradual and, at times, turbulent -- we must be patientwith others. And the Middle East countries have some distance to travel. Arab scholars speak of a freedom deficit that has separated whole nations from the progress of our time. The essentials of social and material progress -- limited government, equal justice under law, religious and economic liberty, political participation, free press, and respect for the rights of women -- have been scarce across the region. Yet that has begun to change. In an arc of reform from Morocco to Jordan to Qatar, we are seeing elections and new protections for women and the stirring of political pluralism. Many governments are realizing that theocracy and dictatorship do not lead to national greatness; they end in national ruin. They are finding, as others will find, that national progress and dignity are achieved whengovernments are just and people are free. The democratic progress we've seen in the Middle East was not imposed from abroad, and neither will the greater progress we hope to see. Freedom, by definition, must be chosen, and defended by those who choose it. Our part, as free nations, is to ally ourselves with reform,wherever it occurs. Perhaps the most helpful change we can make is to change in our own thinking. In the West, there's been a certain skepticism about the capacity or even the desire of Middle Eastern peoples for self-government. We're told that Islam is somehow inconsistent with a democratic culture. Yet more than half of the world's Muslims are today contributing citizens in democratic societies. It is suggested that the poor, in their daily struggles, care little for self- government. Yet the poor, especially, need the power of democracy to defend themselvesagainst corrupt elites. Peoples of the Middle East share a high civilization, a religion of personal responsibility, and a need for freedom as deep as our own. It is not realism to suppose that one-fifth of humanityis unsuited to liberty; it is pessimism and condescension, and we should have none of it. We must shake off decades of failed policy in the Middle East. Your nation and mine, in the past, have been willing to make a bargain, to tolerate oppression for the sake of stability. Longstanding ties often led us to overlook the faults of local elites. Yet this bargain did not bring stability or make us safe. It merely bought time, while problemsfestered and ideologies of violence took hold. As recent history has shown, we cannot turn a blind eye to oppression just because the oppression is not in our own backyard. No longer should we think tyranny is benign because it is temporarily convenient. Tyranny is never benign to its victims, and our great democraciesshould oppose tyranny wherever it is found. Now we're pursuing a different course, a forward strategy of freedom in the Middle East. We will consistently challenge the enemies of reform and confront the allies of terror. We will expect a higher standard from our friends in the region, and we will meet our responsibilitiesin Afghanistan and in Iraq by finishing the work of democracy we have begun. There were good-faith disagreements in your country and mine over the course and timing of military action in Iraq. Whatever has come before, we now have only two options: to keep our word, or to break our word. The failure of democracy in Iraq would throw its people back into misery and turn that country over to terrorists who wish to destroy us. Yet democracy will succeed in Iraq, because our will is firm, our word is good, and the Iraqi people will notsurrender their freedom. Since the liberation of Iraq, we have seen changes that could hardly have been imagined a year ago. A new Iraqi police force protects the people, instead of bullying them. More than 150 Iraqi newspapers are now in circulation, printing what they choose, not what they're ordered. Schools are open, with textbooks free of propaganda. Hospitals are functioning and are well-supplied. Iraq has a new currency, the first battalion of a new army, representative local governments, and a Governing Council with an aggressive timetable for national sovereignty. This is substantial progress. And much of it has proceeded faster than similarefforts in Germany and Japan after World War II. Yet the violence we are seeing in Iraq today is serious. And it comes from Baathist holdouts and Jihadists from other countries, and terrorists drawn to the prospect of innocent bloodshed. It is the nature of terrorism and the cruelty of a few to try to bring grief in the loss to many. The armed forces of both our countries have taken losses, felt deeply by our citizens. Some families now live with a burden of great sorrow. We cannot take the pain away. But these families can know they are not alone. We pray for their strength; we pray for theircomfort; and we will never forget the courage of the ones they loved. The terrorists have a purpose, a strategy to their cruelty. They view the rise of democracy in Iraq as a powerful threat to their ambitions. In this, they are correct. They believe their acts of terror against our coalition, against international aid workers and against innocent Iraqis,will make us recoil and retreat. In this, they are mistaken. We did not charge hundreds of miles into the heart of Iraq and pay a bitter cost of casualties, and liberate 25 million people, only to retreat before a band of thugs and assassins. We will help the Iraqi people establish a peaceful and democratic country in the heart of the MiddleEast. And by doing so, we will defend our people from danger. The forward strategy of freedom must also apply to the Arab-Israeli conflict. It's a difficult period in a part of the world that has known many. Yet, our commitment remains firm. We seek justice and dignity. We seek a viable, independent state for the Palestinian people, who have been betrayed by others for too long. We seek security and recognition for the state of Israel, which has lived in the shadow of random death for too long. These are worthy goals in themselves, and by reaching them we will also remove an occasion and excuse for hatred andviolence in the broader Middle East. Achieving peace in the Holy Land is not just a matter of the shape of a border. As we work on the details of peace, we must look to the heart of the matter, which is the need for a viable Palestinian democracy. Peace will not be achieved by Palestinian rulers who intimidate opposition, who tolerate and profit from corruption and maintain their ties to terrorist groups. These are the methods of the old elites, who time and again had put their own self-interest above the interest of the people they claim to serve. The long-suffering Palestinian people deserve better. They deserve true leaders, capable of creating and governing a Palestinianstate. Even after the setbacks and frustrations of recent months, goodwill and hard effort can bring about a Palestinian state and a secure Israel. Those who would lead a new Palestine should adopt peaceful means to achieve the rights of their people and create the reformedinstitutions of a stable democracy. Israel should freeze settlement construction, dismantle unauthorized outposts, end the daily humiliation of the Palestinian people, and not prejudice final negotiations with the placementsof walls and fences. Arab states should end incitement in their own media, cut off public and private funding forterrorism, and establish normal relations with Israel. Leaders in Europe should withdraw all favor and support from any Palestinian ruler who fails his people and betrays their cause. And Europe's leaders -- and all leaders -- should stronglyoppose anti-Semitism, which poisons public debates over the future of the Middle East. Ladies and gentlemen, we have great objectives before us that make our Atlantic alliance as vital as it has ever been. We will encourage the strength and effectiveness of international institutions. We will use force when necessary in the defense of freedom. And we will raise upan ideal of democracy in every part of the world. On these three pillars we will build the peace and security of all free nations in a time ofdanger. So much good has come from our alliance of conviction and might. So much now depends on the strength of this alliance as we go forward. America has always found strong partners in London, leaders of good judgment and blunt counsel and backbone when times are tough. And I have found all those qualities in your current Prime Minister, who has my respect andmy deepest thanks. The ties between our nations, however, are deeper than the relationship between leaders. These ties endure because they are formed by the experience and responsibilities and adversity we have shared. And in the memory of our peoples, there will always be one experience, one central event, when the seal was fixed on the friendship between Britain and the United States: The arrival in Great Britain of more than 1.5 million American soldiers and airmen in the 1940s was a turning point in the second world war. For many Britons, it was a first close look at Americans, other than in the movies. Some of you here today may still remember the ""friendly invasion."" Our lads, they took some getting used to. There was even asaying about what many of them were up to -- in addition to being ""overpaid and over here."" At a reunion in North London some years ago, an American pilot who had settled in England after his military service, said, ""Well, I'm still over here, and probably overpaid. So two out ofthree isn't bad."" In that time of war, the English people did get used to the Americans. They welcomed soldiers and fliers into their villages and homes, and took to calling them, ""our boys."" About 70,000 of those boys did their part to affirm our special relationship. They returned home with Englishbrides. Americans gained a certain image of Britain, as well. We saw an island threatened on every side, a leader who did not waver, and a country of the firmest character. And that has not changed. The British people are the sort of partners you want when serious work needs doin'. The men and women of this Kingdom are kind and steadfast and generous and brave. AndAmerica is fortunate to call this country our closest friend in the world. May God bless you all.",bush
"Good  afternoon.  Yesterday,  December  the  13th,  at  around  8:30  p.m.  Baghdad  time,  United   States  military  forces  captured  Saddam  Hussein  alive.  He  was  found  near  a  farmhouse  outside   the  city  of  Tikrit,  in  a  swift  raid  conducted  without  casualties.  And  now  the  former  dictator  of   Iraq  will  face  the  justice  he  denied  to  millions.   The  capture  of  this  man  was  crucial  to  the  rise  of  a  free  Iraq.   It  marks  the  end  of  the  road  for  him,  and  for  all  who  bullied  and  killed  in  his  name.  For  the   Baathist  holdouts  largely  responsible  for  the  current  violence,  there  will  be  no  return  to  the   corrupt  power  and  privilege  they  once  held.  For  the  vast  majority  of  Iraqi  citizens  who  wish  to   live  as  free  men  and  women,  this  event  brings  further  assurance  that  the  torture  chambers   and  the  secret  police  are  gone  forever.    And  this  afternoon,  I  have  a  message  for  the  Iraqi  people:  You  will  not  have  to  fear  the  rule  of   Saddam  Hussein  ever  again.  All  Iraqis  who  take  the  side  of  freedom  have  taken  the  winning   side.  The  goals  of  our  coalition  are  the  same  as  your  goals        sovereignty  for  your  country,   dignity  for  your  great  culture,  and  for  every  Iraqi  citizen,  the  opportunity  for  a  better  life.   In  the  history  of  Iraq,  a  dark  and  painful  era  is  over.  A  hopeful  day  has  arrived.  All  Iraqis  can   now  come  together  and  reject  violence  and  build  a  new  Iraq.   The  success  of  yesterday's  mission  is  a  tribute  to  our  men  and  women  now  serving  in  Iraq.   The  operation  was  based  on  the  superb  work  of  intelligence  analysts  who  found  the  dictator's   footprints  in  a  vast  country.  The  operation  was  carried  out  with  skill  and  precision  by  a  brave   fighting  force.  Our  servicemen  and  women  and  our  coalition  allies  have  faced  many  dangers  in   the  hunt  for  members  of  the  fallen  regime,  and  in  their  effort  to  bring  hope  and  freedom  to   the  Iraqi  people.  Their  work  continues,  and  so  do  the  risks.  Today,  on  behalf  of  the  nation,  I   thank  the  members  of  our  Armed  Forces  and  I  congratulate  'em.   I  also  have  a  message  for  all  Americans:  The  capture  of  Saddam  Hussein  does  not  mean  the   end  of  violence  in  Iraq.  We  still  face  terrorists  who  would  rather  go  on  killing  the  innocent  than   accept  the  rise  of  liberty  in  the  heart  of  the  Middle  East.  Such  men  are  a  direct  threat  to  the   American  people,  and  they  will  be  defeated.   We've  come  to  this  moment  through  patience  and  resolve  and  focused  action.  And  that  is  our   strategy  moving  forward.  The  war  on  terror  is  a  different  kind  of  war,  waged  capture  by   capture,  cell  by  cell,  and  victory  by  victory.  Our  security  is  assured  by  our  perseverance  and   by  our  sure  belief  in  the  success  of  liberty.  And  the  United  States  of  America  will  not  relent   until  this  war  is  won.   May  God  bless  the  people  of  Iraq,  and  may  God  bless  America.   Thank  you.",bush
"Good morning. Thank you all for coming. I take great joy in making this announcement. It's going to be one of the most important initiatives that my Administration not only discusses,but implements. First, it's good to have so many groups represented here -- religious and non-religious; Catholic, Jewish, Protestant, and Muslim; foundations and other non-profits. I want to thankyou all for coming. This is a collection of some of the finest America has got to offer -- people who lead with their hearts, and in turn, have changed the communities in which they live for the better. Thismeeting is a picture of the strength and diversity and compassion of our country. This is a diverse group, but we share things in common. We provide more than -- They provide more than practical help to people in need. They touch and change hearts. And forthis, America is deeply appreciative. Everyone in this room knows firsthand that there are still deep needs and real suffering in the shadow of America's affluence. Problems like addiction and abandonment and gang violence,domestic violence, mental illness and homelessness. We are called by conscience to respond. As I said in my Inaugural Address, ""compassion is the work of a nation, not just a government."" It is more than the calling of politicians; it is the calling of citizens. It is citizens who turn mean streets into good neighborhoods. It is citizens who turn cold cities into realcommunities. It is one of the great goals of my Administration to invigorate the spirit of involvement and citizenship. We will encourage faith-based and community programs without changing their mission. We will help all in their work to change hearts while keeping a commitment topluralism. I approach this goal with some basic principles: Government has important responsibilities for public health or public order and civil rights. Yet government -- And government will never be replaced by charities and community groups. Yet when we see social needs in America, my Administration will look first to faith-based programs and community groups, which have proven their power to save and change lives. We will not fund the religious activities of anygroup, but when people of faith provide social services, we will not discriminate against them. As long as there are secular alternatives, faith-based charities should be able to compete for funding on an equal basis, and in a manner that does not cause them to sacrifice their mission. And we will make sure that help goes to large organizations and to small ones as well. We value large organizations with generations of experience. We also valueneighborhood healers, who have only the scars and testimony of their own experience. Tomorrow I will begin turning these principles into a legislative agenda. I will send to Congress a series of ideas and proposals. Today, I want to raise the priority and profile of these issues within my own Administration. I want to ensure that faith-based and communitygroups will always have a place at the table in our deliberations. In a few moments, I will sign two executive orders. The first executive order will create a new office, called the White House Office of Faith-based and Community Initiatives. The head of this office will report directly to me and be charged with important responsibilities. He will oversee our initiatives on this issue. He will make sure our government, where it works with private groups, is fair and supportive. And he will highlight groups as national models soothers can learn from them. The second executive order will clear away the bureaucratic barriers in several important agencies that make private groups hesitate to work with government. It will establish centers in five agencies -- Justice, HUD, HHS, Labor and Education -- to ensure greater cooperation between the government and the independent sector. These centers will report back on regulatory barriers to working with non-profit groups, and make recommendations on howthose barriers can be removed. I have put this broad effort into the hands of two exceptional people -- first, Steve Goldsmith, known as one of the most innovative mayors in America, who pioneered ways to promote community efforts. He will continue to advise me on these issues. And I have asked Steve toserve on the board of the Corporation for National Service. This organization has done some good work in mobilizing volunteers of all ages. I've asked Steve to report to me on how we can make the corporation do better, and to get help whereit's most needed. And secondly, Professor John Dilulio will head the new office I am announcing today. He is one of the most influential social entrepreneurs in America. I can't tell you how honored I am for him to leave his post in academia to join us. He is the author of a respected textbook on American government. He has a servant's heart on the issues that we will confront. He's worked with disadvantaged children. He has been a major force in mobilizing the city of -- ofPhiladelphia to support faith-based and community groups. It's a fantastic team. I'm honored to have them on my team. I look forward to hearing from them, as well as I look forward to working with the people in this room and the social entrepreneurs all across America who have heard the universal call to love a neighbor like they'd like to be loved themselves; to exist and work hard, not out of the love of money, but out of the love of their fellow human beings. I'm absolutely convinced the great fabric of the nation exists in neighborhoods, amongst unsung heroes who do heroic acts on a daily and hourly basis. It's the fabric of the country that makes America unique. It is -- The power of promise that makes the future so promisingis the power of the missions that stand behind me. This is an effort that will be an effort from, now the second week of my Administration to the last week of my Administration, because I'm confident that this initiative, when fully implemented, will help us realize the dream that America, its hopes, its promise, itsgreatness, will extend its reach throughout every single neighborhood, all across the land. And now it is my honor to sign the two executive orders.",bush
"Thank you all very much. I'm honored to join with President Clinton, President Bush, Senator Dole and other distinguished guests on this day of remembrance and celebration. And, General Kelley, here in the company of the generation that won the war, I proudly accept theWorld War II Memorial on behalf of the people of the United States of America. Raising up this Memorial took skill and vision and patience. Now the work is done, and it is a fitting tribute, open and expansive, like America; grand and enduring, like the achievements we honor. The years of World War II were a hard, heroic and gallant time in the life of our country. When it mattered most, an entire generation of Americans showed the finest qualities of our nation and of humanity. On this day, in their honor, we will raise the American flag overa monument that will stand as long as America itself. In the history books, the Second World War can appear as a series of crises and conflicts, following an inevitable course -- from Pearl Harbor to the Coast of Normandy to the deck of the Missouri. Yet, on the day the war began, and on many hard days that followed, theoutcome was far from certain. There was a time, in the years before the war, when many earnest and educated people believed that democracy was finished. Men who considered themselves learned and civilized came to believe that free institutions must give way to the severe doctrines and stern discipline of a regimented society. Ideas first whispered in the secret councils of a remote empire, or shouted in the beer halls of Munich, became mass movements. And those movements became armies. And those armies moved mercilessly forward -- until the world saw Hitler strutting in Paris, and U.S. Navy ships burning in their own port. Across the world,from a hiding place in Holland to prison camps of Luzon, the captives awaited their liberators. Those liberators would come, but the enterprise would require the commitment and effort of our entire nation. As World War II began, after a decade of economic depression, the United States was not a rich country. Far from being a great power, we had only the 17th largest army in the world. To fight and win on two fronts, Americans had to work and save and ration and sacrifice as never before. War production plants operated shifts around the clock. Across the country, families planted victory gardens -- 20 million of them, producing 40 percent of the nation's vegetables in backyards and on rooftops. Two out of every three citizens put money into war bonds. As Colonel Oveta Culp Hobby said, ""This was a people's war, andeveryone was in it."" As life changed in America, so did the way that Americans saw our own country and its place in the world. The bombs at Pearl Harbor destroyed the very idea that America could live in isolation from the plots of aggressive powers. The scenes of the concentration camps, the heaps of bodies and ghostly survivors, confirmed forever America's calling to oppose theideologies of death. As we defended our ideals, we began to see that America is stronger when those ideals are fully implemented. America gained strength because women labored for victory and factory jobs, cared for the wounded and wore the uniform, themselves. America gained strength because African Americans and Japanese Americans and others fought for their country, which wasn't always fair to them. In time, these contributions became expectations of equality, andthe advances for justice in post-war America made us a better country. With all our flaws, Americans at that time had never been more united. And together we began and completed the largest single task in our history. At the height of conflict, America would have ships on every ocean, and armies on five continents. And on the most crucial ofdays, would move the equivalent of a major city across the English Channel. And all these vast movements of men and armor were directed by one man who could not walk on his own strength. President Roosevelt brought his own advantages to the job. His resolve was stronger than the will of any dictator. His belief in democracy was absolute. He possessed a daring that kept the enemy guessing. He spoke to Americans with an optimism that lightened their task. And one of the saddest days of the war came just as it was ending, when the casualty notice in the morning paper began with the name, Franklin D. Roosevelt,Commander-in-Chief. Across the years, we still know his voice. And from his words, we know that he understood the character of the American people. Dictators and their generals had dismissed Americans as no match for a master race. FDR answered them. In one of his radio addresses, he said, ""We have been described as a nation of weaklings, playboys. Let them tell that to General McArthur and his men. Let them tell that to the boys in the flying fortresses. Let them tell thatto the Marines."" In all, more than 16 million Americans would put on the uniform of the soldier, the sailor, the airman, the Marine, the Coast Guardsman or the Merchant Mariner. They came from city streets and prairie towns, from public high schools and West Point. They were a modest bunch, and still are. The ranks were filled with men like Army Private Joe Sakato. In heavy fighting in France, he saw a good friend killed, and charged up a hill determined to shoot the ones who did it. Private Sakato ran straight into enemy fire, killing 12, wounding two, capturing four, and inspiring his whole unit to take the hill and destroy the enemy. Looking back on it 55 years later, Joe Sakato said, ""I'm not a hero. Nowadays they call what I did'road rage.'"" This man's conduct that day gained him the Medal of Honor, one of 464 awarded for actions in World War II. Americans in uniform served bravely, fought fiercely and kept their honor -- even under the worst of conditions. Yet they were not warriors by nature. All they wanted was to finish the job and make it home. One soldier in the 58th Armor Field Artillery was known to have the best-kept rifle in the unit. He told his buddies he had plans for that weapon after the war. He said, ""I want to take ithome, cover it in salt, hang it on a wall in my living room so I can watch it rust."" These were the modest sons of a peaceful country, and millions of us are very proud to call them Dad. They gave the best years of their lives to the greatest mission their country ever accepted. They faced the most extreme danger, which took some and spared others, for reasons only known to God. And wherever they advanced or touched ground, they are remembered for their goodness and their decency. A Polish man recalls being marched through the German countryside in the last weeks of the war, when American forces suddenly appeared. He said, ""Our two guards ran away. And this soldier with little blonde hair jumps off his tank. 'You're free,' he shouts at us. We started hugging each other, crying and screaming,'God sent angels down to pick us up out of this hell place.'"" Well, our boys weren't exactly angels. They were flesh and blood, with all the limits and fears of flesh and blood. That only makes the achievement more remarkable -- the courage they showed, in a conflict that claimed more than 400,000 American lives, leaving so manyorphans and widows and Gold Star Mothers. The soldiers' story was best told by the great Ernie Pyle, who shared their lives and died among them. In his book, ""Here Is Your War,"" he described World War II as many veterans now remember it. It is a picture, he wrote, ""of tired and dirty soldiers, who are alive and don't want to die; of long, darkened convoys in the middle of the night; of shocked, silent men wandering back down the hill from battle; of Jeeps and petrol dumps and smelly bedding roles and C-rations; and blown bridges and dead mules and hospital tents and shirt collars greasy- black from months of wearing; and of laughter, too, and anger, and wine, and lovely flowersand constant cussing. All these, it is composed of; and of graves and graves and graves."" On this Memorial Day weekend, the graves will be visited, and decorated with flowers and flags. Men whose step has slowed are thinking of boys they knew when they were boys together. And women who watched the train leave, and the years pass, can still see thehandsome face of their young sweetheart. America will not forget them, either. At this place, at this Memorial, we acknowledge a debt of long-standing to an entire generation of Americans: those who died; those who fought and worked and grieved and went on. They saved our country, and thereby saved the liberty of mankind. And now I ask every man and woman who saw and lived World War II -- every member of that generation -- toplease rise as you are able, and receive the thanks of our great nation. May God bless you.",bush
"This is a sad hour in the life of America. A great American life has come to an end. I have just spoken to Nancy Reagan. On behalf of our whole nation, Laura and I offered her and the Reagan family our prayers and ourcondolences. Ronald Reagan won America's respect with his greatness, and won its love with his goodness. He had the confidence that comes with conviction, the strength that comes with character, the grace that comes with humility, and the humor that comes with wisdom. He leaves behind anation he restored and a world he helped save. During the years of President Reagan, America laid to rest an era of division and self-doubt. And because of his leadership, the world laid to rest an era of fear and tyranny. Now, in layingour leader to rest, we say thank you. He always told us that for America, the best was yet to come. We comfort ourselves in theknowledge that this is true for him, too. His work is done, and now a shining city awaits him. May God bless Ronald Reagan.",bush
"We lost Ronald Reagan only days ago, but we have missed him for a long time. We have missed his kindly presence, that reassuring voice, and the happy ending we had wished for him. It has been ten years since he said his own farewell; yet it is still very sad and hard to lethim go. Ronald Reagan belongs to the ages now, but we preferred it when he belonged to us. In a life of good fortune, he valued above all the gracious gift of his wife, Nancy. During his career, Ronald Reagan passed through a thousand crowded places; but there was only oneperson, he said, who could make him lonely by just leaving the room. America honors you, Nancy, for the loyalty and love you gave this man on a wonderfuljourney, and to that journey's end. Today, our whole nation grieves with you and your family. When the sun sets tonight off the coast of California, and we lay to rest our 40th President, a great American story will close. The second son of Nell and Jack Reagan first knew the world as a place of open plains, quiet streets, gas-lit rooms, and carriages drawn by horse. If you could go back to the Dixon, Illinois of 1922, you'd find a boy of 11 reading adventure stories at the public library, or running with his brother, Neil, along Rock River, and coming home to a little house on Hennepin Avenue. That town was the kind of place you remember where you prayed side by side with your neighbors, and if things were going wrong for them, you prayedfor them, and knew they'd pray for you if things went wrong for you. The Reagan family would see its share of hardship, struggle and uncertainty. And out of that circumstance came a young man of steadiness, calm, and a cheerful confidence that life would bring good things. The qualities all of us have seen in Ronald Reagan were first spotted 70 and 80 years ago. As a lifeguard in Lowell Park, he was the protector keeping an eye out for trouble. As a sports announcer on the radio, he was the friendly voice that made you see the game as he did. As an actor, he was the handsome, all-American, good guy, which, in hiscase, required knowing his lines -- and being himself. Along the way, certain convictions were formed and fixed in the man. Ronald Reagan believed that everything happened for a reason, and that we should strive to know and do the will of God. He believed that the gentleman always does the kindest thing. He believed that people were basically good, and had the right to be free. He believed that bigotry and prejudice were the worst things a person could be guilty of. He believed in the Golden Rule and in the power of prayer. He believed that America was not just a place in the world, but the hope of theworld. And he believed in taking a break now and then, because, as he said, there's nothing betterfor the inside of a man than the outside of a horse. Ronald Reagan spent decades in the film industry and in politics, fields known, on occasion, to change a man. But not this man. From Dixon to Des Moines, to Hollywood to Sacramento, to Washington, D.C., all who met him remembered the same sincere, honest, upright fellow. Ronald Reagan's deepest beliefs never had much to do with fashion or convenience. His convictions were always politely stated, affably argued, and as firm and straight as thecolumns of this cathedral. There came a point in Ronald Reagan's film career when people started seeing a future beyond the movies. The actor, Robert Cummings, recalled one occasion. ""I was sitting around the set with all these people and we were listening to Ronnie, quite absorbed. I said, 'Ron, have you ever considered someday becoming President?' He said, 'President of what?' 'President of the United States,' I said. And he said, 'What's the matter, don't you like myacting either?'"" The clarity and intensity of Ronald Reagan's convictions led to speaking engagements around the country, and a new following he did not seek or expect. He often began his speeches by saying, ""I'm going to talk about controversial things."" And then he spoke of communist rulers as slavemasters, of a government in Washington that had far overstepped its proper limits, of a time for choosing that was drawing near. In the space of a few years, he took ideas and principles that were mainly found in journals and books, and turned them into a broad,hopeful movement ready to govern. As soon as Ronald Reagan became California's governor, observers saw a star in the West -- tanned, well-tailored, in command, and on his way. In the 1960s, his friend, Bill Buckley, wrote, ""Reagan is indisputably a part of America, and he may become a part of Americanhistory."" Ronald Reagan's moment arrived in 1980. He came out ahead of some very good men, including one from Plains, and one from Houston. What followed was one of the decisive decades of the century, as the convictions that shaped the President began to shape thetimes. He came to office with great hopes for America, and more than hopes -- like the President he had revered and once saw in person, Franklin Roosevelt, Ronald Reagan matched an optimistic temperament with bold, persistent action. President Reagan was optimistic about the great promise of economic reform, and he acted to restore the reward and spirit of enterprise. He was optimistic that a strong America could advance the peace, and he acted to build the strength that mission required. He was optimistic that liberty would thrive whereverit was planted, and he acted to defend liberty wherever it was threatened. And Ronald Reagan believed in the power of truth in the conduct of world affairs. When he saw evil camped across the horizon, he called that evil by its name. There were no doubters in the prisons and gulags, where dissidents spread the news, tapping to each other in code what the American President had dared to say. There were no doubters in the shipyards and churches and secret labor meetings, where brave men and women began to hear the creaking and rumbling of a collapsing empire. And there were no doubters among those who swung hammers at the hated wall as the first and hardest blow had been struck by President RonaldReagan. The ideology he opposed throughout his political life insisted that history was moved by impersonal ties and unalterable fates. Ronald Reagan believed instead in the courage andtriumph of free men. And we believe it, all the more, because we saw that courage in him. As he showed what a President should be, he also showed us what a man should be. Ronald Reagan carried himself, even in the most powerful office, with a decency and attention to small kindnesses that also defined a good life. He was a courtly, gentle and considerate man, never known to slight or embarrass others. Many people across the country cherish letters he wrote in his own hand -- to family members on important occasions; to old friends dealing with sickness and loss; to strangers with questions about his days in Hollywood. A boy oncewrote to him requesting federal assistance to help clean up his bedroom. The President replied that, ""unfortunately, funds are dangerously low."" He continued, ""I'm sure your mother was fully justified in proclaiming your room a disaster. Therefore, you are inan excellent position to launch another volunteer program in our nation. Congratulations."" Sure, our 40th President wore his title lightly, and it fit like a white Stetson. In the end, through his belief in our country and his love for our country, he became an enduring symbol of our country. We think of his steady stride, that tilt of a head and snap of a salute, the big- screen smile, and the glint in his Irish eyes when a story came to mind. We think of a man advancing in years with the sweetness and sincerity of a Scout saying the Pledge. We think of that grave expression that sometimes came over his face, the seriousness of a man angered by injustice -- and frightened by nothing. We know, as he always said, that America's best days are ahead of us, but with Ronald Reagan's passing, some very fine daysare behind us, and that is worth our tears. Americans saw death approach Ronald Reagan twice, in a moment of violence, and then in the years of departing light. He met both with courage and grace. In these trials, he showed howa man so enchanted by life can be at peace with life's end. And where does that strength come from? Where is that courage learned? It is the faith of a boy who read the Bible with his mom. It is the faith of a man lying in an operating room, who prayed for the one who shot him before he prayed for himself. It is the faith of a man with afearful illness, who waited on the Lord to call him home. Now, death has done all that death can do. And as Ronald Wilson Reagan goes his way, we are left with the joyful hope he shared. In his last years, he saw through a glass darkly. Nowhe sees his Savior face to face. And we look to that fine day when we will see him again, all weariness gone, clear of mind,strong and sure, and smiling again, and the sorrow of his parting gone forever. May God bless Ronald Reagan, and the country he loved.",bush
"Mr. Chairman! Mr. Chairman, delegates, fellow citizens: I'm honored by your support, and Iaccept your nomination for President of the United States. When I -- When I said those words four years ago, none of us could have envisioned whatthese years would bring. In the heart of this great city, we saw tragedy arrive on a quietmorning. We saw the bravery of rescuers grow with danger. We learned of passengers on adoomed plane who died with a courage that frightened their killers. We have seen a shakeneconomy rise to its feet. And we have seen Americans in uniform storming mountainstrongholds, and charging through sandstorms, and liberating millions, with acts of valor thatwould make the men of Normandy proud. Since 2001, Americans have been given hills to climb, and found the strength to climb them.Now, because we have made the hard journey, we can see the valley below. Now, because wehave faced challenges with resolve, we have historic goals within our reach, and greatness inour future. We will build a safer world and a more hopeful America and nothing will hold usback. In the work we have done, and the work we will do, I am fortunate to have a superb VicePresident. I have counted on Dick Cheney's calm and steady judgment in difficult days, andI'm honored to have him at my side. I am grateful to share my walk in life with Laura Bush. Americans -- Americans have come tosee the goodness and kindness and strength I first saw 26 years ago, and we love our FirstLady. I'm a fortunate father of two spirited, intelligent, and lovely young women. I'm blessed with a sister and brothers who are my closest friends. And I will always be theproud and grateful son of George and Barbara Bush. My father served eight years at the side of another great American: Ronald Reagan. His -- Hisspirit of optimism and goodwill and decency are in this hall, and are in our hearts, and willalways define our Party. Two months from today, voters will make a choice based on the records we have built, theconvictions we hold, and the vision that guides us forward. A presidential election is a contestfor the future. Tonight I will tell you where I stand, what I believe, and where I will lead thiscountry in the next four years. I believe -- I believe every child can learn, and every school must teach, so we passed themost important federal education reform in history. Because we acted, children are makingsustained progress in reading and math, America's schools are getting better, and nothing willhold us back. I believe we have a moral responsibility to honor America's seniors, so I brought Republicansand Democrats together to strengthen Medicare. Now seniors are getting immediate helpbuying medicine. Soon every senior will be able to get prescription drug coverage, andnothing will hold us back. I believe in the energy and innovative spirit of America's workers, entrepreneurs, farmers, andranchers, so we unleashed that energy with the largest tax relief in a generation. Because weacted, our economy is growing again, and creating jobs, and nothing will hold us back. I believe the most solemn duty of the American president is to protect the American people. IfAmerica shows uncertainty or weakness in this decade, the world will drift toward tragedy.This will not happen on my watch. I'm running for President with a clear and positive plan to build a safer world, and a morehopeful America. I'm running with a compassionate conservative philosophy: that governmentshould help people improve their lives, not try to run their lives. I believe this Nation wantssteady, consistent, principled leadership and that is why, with your help, we will win thiselection. The story -- The story of America is the story of expanding liberty: an ever-widening circle,constantly growing to reach further and include more. Our Nation's founding commitment isstill our deepest commitment: In our world, and here at home, we will extend the frontiers offreedom. The times in which we live and work are changing dramatically. The workers of our parents'generation typically had one job, one skill, one career often with one company that providedhealth care and a pension. And most of those workers were men. Today, workers change jobs,even careers, many times during their lives, and in one of the most dramatic shifts our societyhas seen, two-thirds of all Moms also work outside the home. This changed world can be a time of great opportunity for all Americans to earn a betterliving, support your family, and have a rewarding career. And government must take yourside. Many of our most fundamental systems -- the tax code, health coverage, pension plans,worker training -- were created for the world of yesterday, not tomorrow. We will transformthese systems so that all citizens are equipped, prepared, and thus truly free to make yourown choices and pursue your own dreams. My plan begins with providing the security and opportunity of a growing economy. We nowcompete in a global market that provides new buyers for our goods, but new competition forour workers. To create more jobs in America, America must be the best place in the world todo business. To create jobs, my plan will encourage investment and expansion by restrainingfederal spending, reducing regulation, and making the tax relief permanent. To create jobs,we will make our country less dependent on foreign sources of energy. To create jobs, we willexpand trade and level the playing field to sell American goods and services across the globe.And we must protect small business owners and workers from the explosion of frivolouslawsuits that threaten jobs across our country. Another drag on our economy is the current tax code, which is a complicated mess filled withspecial interest loopholes, saddling our people with more than six billion hours of paperworkand headache every year. The American people deserve and our economic future demands asimpler, fairer, pro-growth system. In a new term, I will lead a bipartisan effort to reform andsimplify the federal tax code. Another priority in a new term will be to help workers take advantage of the expandingeconomy to find better and higher-paying jobs. In this time of change, many workers want togo back to school to learn different or higher-level skills. So we will double the number ofpeople served by our principal job training program and increase funding for our communitycolleges. I know that with the right skills, American workers can compete with anyone,anywhere in the world. In this time of change, opportunity in some communities is more distant than in others. Tostand with workers in poor communities and those that have lost manufacturing, textile, andother jobs we will create American opportunity zones. In these areas, we will provide tax reliefand other incentives to attract new business, and improve housing and job training to bringhope and work throughout all of America. As I've traveled the country, I've met many workers and small business owners who have toldme that they are worried they cannot afford health care. More than half of the uninsured aresmall business employees and their families. In a new term, we must allow small firms to jointogether to purchase insurance at the discounts available to big companies. We will offer a taxcredit to encourage small businesses and their employees to set up health savings accounts,and provide -- and provide direct help for low-income Americans to purchase them. Theseaccounts give workers the security of insurance against major illness, the opportunity to savetax-free for routine health expenses, and the freedom of knowing you can take your accountwith you whenever you change jobs. We will provide low-income Americans with better accessto health care: In a new term, I will ensure every poor county in America has a community orrural health center. As I've traveled our country, I've met too many good doctors, especially OBGYNS, who arebeing forced out of practice because of the high cost of lawsuits. To make health care moreaffordable and accessible, we must pass medical liability reform now. And in all we do toimprove health care in America, we will make sure that health decisions are made by doctorsand patients, not by bureaucrats in Washington, DC. In this time of change, government must take the side of working families. In a new term, wewill change outdated labor laws to offer comp-time and flex-time. Our laws should never standin the way of a more family-friendly workplace. Another priority for a new term is to build an ownership society, because ownership bringssecurity, and dignity, and independence. Thanks to our policies, homeownership in America isat an all-time high. Tonight we set a new goal: seven million more affordable homes in thenext 10 years so more American families will be able to open the door and say welcome to myhome. In an ownership society, more people will own their health care plans, and have theconfidence of owning a piece of their retirement. We'll always keep the promise of SocialSecurity for our older workers. With the huge Baby Boom generation approaching retirement,many of our children and grandchildren understandably worry whether Social Security will bethere when they need it. We must strengthen Social Security by allowing younger workers tosave some of their taxes in a personal -- personal account, a nest egg you can call your own,and government can never take away. In all these proposals, we seek to provide not just a government program, but a path -- apath to greater opportunity, more freedom, and more control over your own life. And the pathbegins with our youngest Americans. To build a more hopeful America, we must help ourchildren reach as far as their vision and character can take them. Tonight, I remind everyparent and every teacher, I say to every child: No matter what your circumstance, no matterwhere you live, your school will be the path to promise of America. We are transforming our schools by raising standards and focusing on results. We are insistingon accountability, empowering parents and teachers, and making sure that local people are incharge of their schools. By testing every child, we are identifying those who need help -- andwe are providing a record level of funding to get them that help. In northeast Georgia,Gainesville Elementary School is mostly Hispanic and 90 percent poor -- and this year 90percent of its students passed state tests in reading and math. The principal -- The principalexpresses the philosophy of his school this way: ""We don't focus on what we can't do at thisschool; we focus on what we can do. And we do whatever it takes to get kids across the finishline."" See, this principal is challenging the soft bigotry of low expectations, and that is thespirit of our education reform, and the commitment of our country: No dejaremos a ning  nni  o atr  s. ""We will leave no child behind."" We are making progress -- We are making and there is more to do. In this time of change,most new jobs are filled by people with at least two years of college, yet only about one infour students gets there. In our high schools, we will fund early intervention programs to helpstudents at risk. We will place a new focus on math and science. As we make progress, we willrequire a rigorous exam before graduation. By raising performance in our high schools, andexpanding Pell grants for low and middle income families, we will help more Americans starttheir career with a college diploma. America's children must also have a healthy start in life. In a new term, we will lead anaggressive effort to enroll millions of poor children who are eligible but not signed up for thegovernment's health insurance programs. We will not allow a lack of attention, or information,to stand between these children and the health care they need. Anyone who wants more details on my agenda can find 'em online. The web address is notvery imaginative, but it's easy to remember: GeorgeWBush.com. These changing times can be exciting times of expanded opportunity. And here, you face achoice. My opponent's policies are dramatically different from ours. Senator Kerry opposedMedicare reform and health savings accounts. After supporting my education reforms, he nowwants to dilute 'em. He opposes legal and medical liability reform. He opposed reducing themarriage penalty, opposed doubling the child credit, opposed lowering income taxes for allwho pay them. (Wait a minute. Wait a minute.) To be fair, there are some things myopponent is for. He's -- He's proposed more than two trillion dollars in federal spending so far,and that's a lot, even for a senator from Massachusetts. And to pay for that spending, he isrunnin' on a platform of increasing taxes, and that's the kind of promise a politician usuallykeeps. His tax and -- His policies of tax and spend, of expanding government rather than expandingopportunity are the politics of the past. We are on the path to the future and we're not turningback. In this world of change, some things do not change: the values we try to live by, theinstitutions that give our lives meaning and purpose. Our society rests on a foundation ofresponsibility and character and family commitment. Because family and work are sources of stability and dignity, I support welfare reform thatstrengthens family and requires work. Because a caring society will value its weakestmembers, we must make a place for the unborn child. Because -- Because religious charitiesprovide a safety net of mercy and compassion, our government must never discriminateagainst them. Because the union of a man and woman deserves an honored place in oursociety, I support the protection of marriage against activist judges. And I will continue toappoint federal judges who know the difference between personal opinion and the strictinterpretation of the law. My opponent recently announced that he's the conservative -- the candidate of ""conservativevalues."" Must have come as a surprise to a lot of his supporters. There are some problemswith this claim. If you say the heart and soul of America is found in Hollywood, I'm afraid youare not the candidate of conservative values. If -- If you voted against the bipartisan Defenseof Marriage Act, which President Clinton signed, you are not the candidate of conservativevalues. If you gave a speech, as my opponent did, calling the Reagan presidency eight yearsof ""moral darkness,"" then you may be a lot of things, but the candidate of conservative valuesis not one of them. This election will also determine how America responds to the continuing danger of terrorism.And you know where I stand. Three days after September the 11th, I stood where Americansdied, in the ruins of the Twin Towers. Workers in hard hats were shouting to me, ""Whatever ittakes."" A fellow grabbed me by the arm and he said, ""Do not let me down."" Since that day, Iwake up every morning thinking about how to better protect our country. I will never relent indefending America whatever it takes. So we have fought the terrorists across the earth not for pride, not for power, but because thelives of our citizens are at stake. Our strategy is clear. We've tripled funding for homelandsecurity and trained a half a million first responders, because we're determined to protect ourhomeland. We're transforming our military and reforming and strengthening our intelligenceservices. We are staying on the offensive, striking terrorists abroad, so we do not have to facethem here at home. And we are working to advance liberty in the broader Middle East,because freedom will bring a future of hope, and the peace we all want. And we will prevail. Our strategy is succeeding. Four years ago, Afghanistan was the home base of al-Qaida;Pakistan was a transit point for terrorist groups; Saudi Arabia was fertile ground for terroristfundraising; Libya was secretly pursuing nucular [nuclear] weapons; Iraq was a gatheringthreat; and al-Qaida was largely unchallenged as it planned attacks. Today, the government of -- of a free Afghanistan is fighting terror; Pakistan is capturingterrorist leaders; Saudi Arabia is making raids and arrests; Libya is dismantling its weaponsprograms; the army of a free Iraq is fighting for freedom; and more than three-quarters of al- Qaida's key members and associates have been detained or killed. We have led; many havejoined; and America and the world are safer. This progress involved careful diplomacy, clear moral purpose, and some tough decisions. Andthe toughest came on Iraq. We knew Saddam Hussein's record of aggression and support forterror. We knew his long history of pursuing, even using, weapons of mass destruction. Andwe know that September the 11th requires our country to think differently: We must, and wewill, confront threats to America before it is too late. In Saddam Hussein, we saw a threat. Members of both political parties, including --. Membersof both political parties, including my opponent and his running mate, saw the threat, andvoted to authorize the use of force. We went to the United Nations Security Council, whichpassed a unanimous resolution demanding the dictator disarm, or face serious consequences.Leaders in the Middle East urged him to comply. After more than a decade of diplomacy, wegave Saddam Hussein another chance, a final chance, to meet his responsibilities to thecivilized world. He again refused, and I faced the kind of decision that comes only to the OvalOffice, a decision no president would ask for, but must be prepared to make. Do I forget thelessons of September the 11th and take the word of a madman, or do I take action to defendour country? Faced with that choice, I will defend America every time. Because we acted to defend our country, the murderous regimes of Saddam Hussein and theTaliban are history, more than 50 million people have been liberated, and democracy iscoming to the broader Middle East. In Afghanistan, terrorists have done everything they canto intimidate people, yet more than 10 million citizens have registered to vote in the Octoberpresidential election -- a resounding endorsement for democracy. Despite ongoing acts ofviolence, Iraq now has a strong Prime Minister, a national council, and national elections arescheduled for January. Our Nation is standing with the people of Afghanistan and Iraq,because when America gives its word, America must keep its word. As importantly, we are serving a vital and historic cause that will make our country safer. Freesocieties in the Middle East will be hopeful societies, which no longer feed resentments andbreed violence for export. Free governments in the Middle East will fight terrorists instead ofharboring them, and that helps us keep the peace. So our mission in Afghanistan and Iraq is clear: We will help new leaders to train their armies,and move toward elections, and get on the path of stability and democracy as quickly aspossible. And then our troops will return home with the honor they have earned. Our troops know the historic importance of our work. One Army Specialist wrote home: ""Weare transforming a once sick society into a hopeful place. The various terrorist enemies weare facing in Iraq,"" he continued, ""are really aiming at you back in the United States. This is atest of will for our country. We soldiers of yours are doing great and scoring victories inconfronting the evil terrorists."" That young man is right -- our men and women in uniform aredoing a superb job for America. Tonight I want to speak to all of them and to their families: You are involved in a struggle ofhistoric proportion. Because of your service and sacrifice, we are defeating the terroristswhere they live and plan, and you're making America safer. Because of you, women inAfghanistan are no longer shot in a sports stadium. Because of you, the people of Iraq nolonger fear being executed and left in mass graves. Because of you, the world is more justand will be more peaceful. We owe you our thanks, and we owe you something more. We willgive you all the resources, all the tools, and all the support you need for victory. Again -- Again my opponent and I have different approaches. I proposed, and the Congressoverwhelmingly passed, 87 billion dollars in funding needed by our troops doing battle inAfghanistan and Iraq. My opponent and his running mate voted against this money for bullets,and fuel, and vehicles, and body armor. When asked to explain his vote, the Senator said, ""Iactually did vote for the 87 billion dollars before I voted against it."" Then he said -- Then hesaid he was ""proud"" of his vote. Then, when pressed, he said it was a ""complicated"" matter.There's nothing complicated about supporting our troops in combat. Our allies also know the historic importance of our work. About 40 nations stand beside us inAfghanistan, and some 30 in Iraq. I deeply appreciate the courage and wise counsel of leaderslike Prime Minister Howard, President Kwasniewski, Prime Minister Berlusconi and, of course,Prime Minister Tony Blair. Again, my opponent takes a different approach. In the midst of war, he has called Americanallies, quote, a ""coalition of the coerced and the bribed."" That would be nations like GreatBritain, Poland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Denmark, El Salvador, Australia, and others --allies that deserve the respect of all Americans, not the scorn of a politician. I respect every soldier, from every country, who serves beside us in the hard work of history.America is grateful, and America will not forget. The people we have freed won't forget either. Not long ago, seven Iraqi men came to see mein the Oval Office. They had ""X""s branded into their foreheads, and their right hands had beencut off by Saddam Hussein's secret police, the sadistic punishment for imaginary crimes.During our emotional visit one of the Iraqi men used his new prosthetic hand to slowly writeout, in Arabic, a prayer for God to bless America. I am proud that our country remains thehope of the oppressed, and the greatest force for good on this earth. Others understand the historic importance of our work. The terrorists know. They know that avibrant, successful democracy at the heart of the Middle East will discredit their radicalideology of hate. They know that men and women with hope and purpose and dignity do notstrap bombs on their bodies and kill the innocent. The terrorists are fighting freedom with alltheir cunning and cruelty because freedom is their greatest fear, and they should be afraid,because freedom is on the march. I believe in the transformational power of liberty: The wisest use of American strength is toadvance freedom. As the citizens of Afghanistan and Iraq seize the moment, their examplewill send a message of hope throughout a vital region. Palestinians will hear the message thatdemocracy and reform are within their reach, and so is peace with our good friend Israel.Young women across the Middle East will hear the message that their day of equality andjustice is coming. Young men will hear the message that national progress and dignity arefound in liberty, not tyranny and terror. Reformers and political prisoners and exiles will hearthe message that their dream of freedom cannot be denied forever. And as freedom advancesheart by heart, and nation by nation America will be more secure and the world morepeaceful. America has done this kind of work before and there have always been doubters. In 1946, 18months after the fall of Berlin to allied forces, a journalist in the New York Times wrote this: ""Germany is a land in an acute stage of economic, political and moral crisis. European capitalsare frightened. In every military headquarters, one meets alarmed officials doing their utmostto deal with the consequences of the occupation policy that they admit has failed."" End quote. Maybe that same person is still around, writing editorials. Fortunately, we had a resolutepresident named Truman, who, with the American people, persevered -- knowing that a newdemocracy at the center of Europe would lead to stability and peace. And because thatgeneration of Americans held firm in the cause of liberty, we live in a better and safer worldtoday. The progress we and our friends and allies seek in the broader Middle East will not comeeasily, or all at once. Yet Americans, of all people, should never be surprised by the power ofliberty to transform lives and nations. That power brought settlers on perilous journeys, inspired colonies to rebellion, ended the sinof slavery, and set our Nation against the tyrannies of the 20th century. We were honored toaid the rise of democracy in Germany and Japan, Nicaragua, Central Europe and the Baltics.And that noble story goes on. I believe that America is called to lead the cause of freedom in a new century. I believe that millions in the Middle East plead in silence for their liberty. I believe that given the chance, they will embrace the most honorable form of governmentever devised by man. I believe all these things because freedom is not America's gift to the world, it is the AlmightyGod's gift to every man and woman in this world. This moment in the life of our country will be remembered. Generations will know if we keptour faith and kept our word. Generations will know if we seized this moment and used it tobuild a future of safety and peace. The freedom of many, and the future security of ourNation, now depend on us. And tonight, my fellow Americans, I ask you to stand with me. In the last four years -- In the last four years, you and I have come to know each other. Evenwhen we don't agree, at least you know what I believe and where I stand. You may have noticed I have a few flaws, too. People sometimes have to correct my English. Iknew I had a problem when Arnold Schwarzenegger started doing it. Some folks look at meand see a certain swagger, which in Texas is called ""walking."" Now and then I come across asa little too blunt and for that we can all thank the white-haired lady sitting right up there. One thing I have learned about the presidency is that whatever shortcomings you have,people are going to notice them and whatever strengths you have, you're gonna need 'em.These four years have brought moments I could not foresee and will not forget. I've tried tocomfort Americans who lost the most on September the 11th -- people who showed me apicture or told me a story, so I'd -- I would know how much was taken from them. I'velearned first-hand that ordering Americans into battle is the hardest decision, even when it isright. I have returned the salute of wounded soldiers, some with a very tough road ahead,who say they were just doing their job. I've held the children of the fallen, who were told theirdad or mom is a hero, but would rather just have their mom or dad. I've met with the parents and wives and husbands who have received a folded flag, and said afinal goodbye to a soldier they loved. I am awed that so many have used those meetings tosay that I'm in their prayers -- and to offer encouragement to me. Where does that strengthlike that come from? How can people so burdened with sorrow also feel such pride? It isbecause they know their loved one was last seen doing good. Because they know that libertywas precious to the one they lost. And in those military families, I have seen the character ofa great nation: decent, idealistic, and strong. The world saw that spirit three miles from here, when the people of this city faced periltogether, and lifted a flag over the ruins, and defied the enemy with their courage. My fellow Americans, for as long as our country stands, people will look to the resurrection ofNew York City and they will say: Here buildings fell; here a nation rose. We see America's character in our military, which finds a way or makes one. We see it in our veterans, who are supporting military families in their days of worry. We see it in our young people, who have found heroes once again. We see that character in workers and entrepreneurs, who are renewing our economy withtheir effort and optimism. And all of this has confirmed one belief beyond doubt: Having come this far, our tested andconfident Nation can achieve anything. To everything we know there is a season -- a time for sadness, a time for struggle, a time forrebuilding. And now we have reached a time for hope. This young century will be liberty's century. By promoting liberty abroad, we will build a saferworld. By encouraging liberty at home, we will build a more hopeful America. Like generationsbefore us, we have a calling from beyond the stars to stand for freedom. This is theeverlasting dream of America and tonight, in this place, that dream is renewed. Now we go forward grateful for our freedom, faithful to our cause, and confident in the futureof the greatest nation on earth. God bless you, and may God continue to bless our great country. Thank you all.",bush
"Thank you for the honor of addressing this General Assembly. The American people respectthe idealism that gave life to this organization. And we respect the men and women of the U.N., who stand for peace and human rights in every part of the world. Welcome to New YorkCity, and welcome to the United States of America. During the past three years, I've addressed this General Assembly in a time of tragedy for my country, and in times of decision for all of us. Now we gather at a time of tremendousopportunity for the U.N. and for all peaceful nations. For decades, the circle of liberty and security and development has been expanding in our world. This progress has brought unity to Europe, self-government to Latin America and Asia, and new hope to Africa. Now we havethe historic chance to widen the circle even further, to fight radicalism and terror with justiceand dignity, to achieve a true peace, founded on human freedom. The United Nations and my country share the deepest commitments. Both the AmericanDeclaration of Independence and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaim the equal value and dignity of every human life. That dignity is honored by the rule of law, limitson the power of the state, respect for women, protection of private property, free speech, equal justice, and religious tolerance. That dignity is dishonored by oppression, corruption,tyranny, bigotry, terrorism and all violence against the innocent. And both of our founding documents affirm that this bright line between justice and injustice -- between right andwrong -- is the same in every age, and every culture, and every nation. Wise governments also stand for these principles for very practical and realistic reasons. We know that dictators are quick to choose aggression, while free nations strive to resolve differences in peace. We know that oppressive governments support terror, while freegovernments fight the terrorists in their midst. We know that free peoples embrace progressand life, instead of becoming the recruits for murderous ideologies. Every nation that wants peace will share the benefits of a freer world. And every nation thatseeks peace has an obligation to help build that world. Eventually, there is no safe isolation from terror networks, or failed states that shelter them, or outlaw regimes, or weapons ofmass destruction. Eventually, there is no safety in looking away, seeking the quiet life byignoring the struggles and oppression of others. In this young century, our world needs a new definition of security. Our security is not merely found in spheres of influence, or some balance of power. The security of our world is found inthe advancing rights of mankind. These rights are advancing across the world -- and across the world, the enemies of human rights are responding with violence. Terrorists and their allies believe the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights and the American Bill of Rights, and every charter of liberty ever written, are lies, to be burned and destroyed and forgotten. They believe that dictators should control every mind and tongue in the Middle East and beyond. They believe that suicide andtorture and murder are fully justified to serve any goal they declare. And they act on theirbeliefs. In the last year alone, terrorists have attacked police stations, and banks, and commutertrains, and synagogues -- and a school filled with children. This month in Beslan we saw, once again, how the terrorists measure their success -- in the death of the innocent, and in the painof grieving families. Svetlana Dzebisov was held hostage, along with her son and her nephew -- her nephew didnot survive. She recently visited the cemetery, and saw what she called the ""little graves."" She said, ""I understand that there is evil in the world. But what have these little creaturesdone?"" Members of the United Nations, the Russian children did nothing to deserve such awful suffering, and fright, and death. The people of Madrid and Jerusalem and Istanbul andBaghdad have done nothing to deserve sudden and random murder. These acts violate the standards of justice in all cultures, and the principles of all religions. All civilized nations are inthis struggle together, and all must fight the murderers. We're determined to destroy terror networks wherever they operate, and the United States isgrateful to every nation that is helping to seize terrorist assets, track down their operatives, and disrupt their plans. We're determined to end the state sponsorship of terror -- and mynation is grateful to all that participated in the liberation of Afghanistan. We're determined to prevent proliferation, and to enforce the demands of the world -- and my nation is grateful tothe soldiers of many nations who have helped to deliver the Iraqi people from an outlawdictator. The dictator agreed in 1991, as a condition of a cease-fire, to fully comply with all Security Council resolutions -- then ignored more than a decade of those resolutions. Finally, theSecurity Council promised serious consequences for his defiance. And the commitments we make must have meaning. When we say ""serious consequences,"" for the sake of peace, theremust be serious consequences. And so a coalition of nations enforced the just demands of theworld. Defending our ideals is vital, but it is not enough. Our broader mission as U.N. members is toapply these ideals to the great issues of our time. Our wider goal is to promote hope and progress as the alternatives to hatred and violence. Our great purpose is to build a betterworld beyond the war on terror. Because we believe in human dignity, America and many nations have established a globalfund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. In three years the contributing countries have funded projects in more than 90 countries, and pledged a total of $5.6 billion to these efforts.America has undertaken a $15 billion effort to provide prevention and treatment and humane care in nations afflicted by AIDS, placing a special focus on 15 countries where the need ismost urgent. AIDS is the greatest health crisis of our time, and our unprecedentedcommitment will bring new hope to those who have walked too long in the shadow of death. Because we believe in human dignity, America and many nations have joined together toconfront the evil of trafficking in human beings. We're supporting organizations that rescue the victims, passing stronger anti-trafficking laws, and warning travelers that they will be heldto account for supporting this modern form of slavery. Women and children should never beexploited for pleasure or greed, anywhere on Earth. Because we believe in human dignity, we should take seriously the protection of life fromexploitation under any pretext. In this session, the U.N. will consider a resolution sponsored by Costa Rica calling for a comprehensive ban on human cloning. I support that resolution andurge all governments to affirm a basic ethical principle: No human life should ever beproduced or destroyed for the benefit of another. Because we believe in human dignity, America and many nations have changed the way we fight poverty, curb corruption, and provide aid. In 2002 we created the Monterrey Consensus,a bold approach that links new aid from developed nations to real reform in developing ones. And through the Millennium Challenge Account, my nation is increasing our aid to developingnations that expand economic freedom and invest in the education and health of their ownpeople. Because we believe in human dignity, America and many nations have acted to lift the crushing burden of debt that limits the growth of developing economies, and holds millions ofpeople in poverty. Since these efforts began in 1996, poor countries with the heaviest debt burdens have received more than $30 billion of relief. And to prevent the build-up of futuredebt, my country and other nations have agreed that international financial institutions shouldincreasingly provide new aid in the form of grants, rather than loans. Because we believe in human dignity, the world must have more effective means to stabilizeregions in turmoil, and to halt religious violence and ethnic cleansing. We must create permanent capabilities to respond to future crises. The United States and Italy have proposed a Global Peace Operations Initiative. G-8 countries will train 75,000 peacekeepers, initiallyfrom Africa, so they can conduct operations on that continent and elsewhere. The countries ofthe G-8 will help this peacekeeping force with deployment and logistical needs. At this hour, the world is witnessing terrible suffering and horrible crimes in the Darfur regionof Sudan, crimes my government has concluded are genocide. The United States played a key role in efforts to broker a cease-fire, and we're providing humanitarian assistance to theSudanese people. Rwanda and Nigeria have deployed forces in Sudan to help improve security so aid can be delivered. The Security Council adopted a new resolution that supports an expanded African Union forceto help prevent further bloodshed, and urges the government of Sudan to stop flights by military aircraft in Darfur. We congratulate the members of the Council on this timely andnecessary action. I call on the government of Sudan to honor the cease-fire it signed, and tostop the killing in Darfur. Because we believe in human dignity, peaceful nations must stand for the advance ofdemocracy. No other system of government has done more to protect minorities, to secure the rights of labor, to raise the status of women, or to channel human energy to the pursuitsof peace. We've witnessed the rise of democratic governments in predominantly Hindu and Muslim, Buddhist, Jewish and Christian cultures. Democratic institutions have taken root in modern societies, and in traditional societies. When it comes to the desire for liberty andjustice, there is no clash of civilizations. People everywhere are capable of freedom, andworthy of freedom. Finding the full promise of representative government takes time, as America has found in twocenturies of debate and struggle. Nor is there any -- only one form of representative government -- because democracies, by definition, take on the unique character of thepeoples that create them. Yet this much we know with certainty: The desire for freedom resides in every human heart. And that desire cannot be contained forever by prison walls, ormartial laws, or secret police. Over time, and across the Earth, freedom will find a way. Freedom is finding a way in Iraq and Afghanistan -- and we must continue to show ourcommitment to democracies in those nations. The liberty that many have won at a cost must be secured. As members of the United Nations, we all have a stake in the success of theworld's newest democracies. Not long ago, outlaw regimes in Baghdad and Kabul threatened the peace and sponsored terrorists. These regimes destabilized one of the world's most vital -- and most volatile -- regions. They brutalized their peoples, in defiance of all civilized norms. Today, the Iraqi andAfghan people are on the path to democracy and freedom. The governments that are rising will pose no threat to others. Instead of harboring terrorists, they're fighting terrorist groups.And this progress is good for the long-term security of us all. The Afghan people are showing extraordinary courage under difficult conditions. They're fighting to defend their nation from Taliban holdouts, and helping to strike against theterrorists killers. They're reviving their economy. They've adopted a constitution that protects the rights of all, while honoring their nation's most cherished traditions. More than 10 million Afghan citizens -- over 4 million of them women -- are now registered tovote in next month's presidential election. To any who still would question whether Muslimsocieties can be democratic societies, the Afghan people are giving their answer. Since the last meeting of this General Assembly, the people of Iraq have regainedsovereignty. Today, in this hall, the Prime Minister of Iraq and his delegation represent a country that has rejoined the community of nations. The government of Prime Minister Allawihas earned the support of every nation that believes in self-determination and desires peace. And under Security Council resolutions 1511 and 1546, the world is providing that support.The U.N., and its member nations, must respond to Prime Minister Allawi's request, and domore to help build an Iraq that is secure, democratic, federal, and free. A democratic Iraq has ruthless enemies, because terrorists know the stakes in that country. They know that a free Iraq in the heart of the Middle East will be a decisive blow against theirambitions for that region. So a terrorists group associated with al Qaeda is now one of the main groups killing the innocent in Iraq today -- conducting a campaign of bombings againstcivilians, and the beheadings of bound men. Coalition forces now serving in Iraq are confronting the terrorists and foreign fighters, so peaceful nations around the world will neverhave to face them within our own borders. Our coalition is standing beside a growing Iraqi security force. The NATO Alliance is providingvital training to that force. More than 35 nations have contributed money and expertise to help rebuild Iraq's infrastructure. And as the Iraqi interim government moves toward nationalelections, officials from the United Nations are helping Iraqis build the infrastructure of democracy. These selfless people are doing heroic work, and are carrying on the great legacyof Sergio de Mello. As we have seen in other countries, one of the main terrorist goals is to undermine, disrupt, and influence election outcomes. We can expect terrorist attacks to escalate as Afghanistan and Iraq approach national elections. The work ahead is demanding. But these difficulties willnot shake our conviction that the future of Afghanistan and Iraq is a future of liberty. Theproper response to difficulty is not to retreat, it is to prevail. The advance of freedom always carries a cost, paid by the bravest among us. America mournsthe losses to our nation, and to many others. And today, I assure every friend of Afghanistan and Iraq, and every enemy of liberty: We will stand with the people of Afghanistan and Iraquntil their hopes of freedom and security are fulfilled. These two nations will be a model for the broader Middle East, a region where millions havebeen denied basic human rights and simple justice. For too long, many nations, including my own, tolerated, even excused, oppression in the Middle East in the name of stability.Oppression became common, but stability never arrived. We must take a different approach. We must help the reformers of the Middle East as they work for freedom, and strive to build acommunity of peaceful, democratic nations. This commitment to democratic reform is essential to resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict. Peace will not be achieved by Palestinian rulers who intimidate opposition, tolerate corruption, andmaintain ties to terrorist groups. The longsuffering Palestinian people deserve better. Theydeserve true leaders capable of creating and governing a free and peaceful Palestinian state. Even after the setbacks and frustrations of recent months, goodwill and hard effort can achieve the promise of the road map to peace. Those who would lead a new Palestinian stateshould adopt peaceful means to achieve the rights of their people, and create the reformed institutions of a stable democracy. Arab states should end incitement in their own media, cutoff public and private funding for terrorism, and establish normal relations with Israel. Israel should impose a settlement freeze, dismantle unauthorized outposts, end the daily humiliationof the Palestinian people, and avoid any actions that prejudice final negotiations. And world leaders should withdraw all favor and support from any Palestinian ruler who fails his peopleand betrays their cause. The democratic hopes we see growing in the Middle East are growing everywhere. In thewords of the Burmese democracy advocate, Aung San Suu Kyi: We do not accept the notion that democracy is a Western value. To the contrary, democracy simply means good government rooted in responsibility, transparency, andaccountability.1 Here at the United Nations, you know this to be true. In recent years, this organization hashelped create a new democracy in East Timor, and the U.N. has aided other nations in makingthe transition to self-rule. Because I believe the advance of liberty is the path to both a safer and better world, today Ipropose establishing a Democracy Fund within the United Nations. This is a great calling for this great organization. The fund would help countries lay the foundations of democracy by instituting the rule of lawand independent courts, a free press, political parties and trade unions. Money from the fund would also help set up voter precincts and polling places, and support the work of electionmonitors. To show our commitment to the new Democracy Fund, the United States will makean initial contribution. I urge other nations to contribute, as well. Today, I've outlined a broad agenda to advance human dignity, and enhance the security ofall of us. The defeat of terror, the protection of human rights, the spread of prosperity, the advance of democracy -- these causes, these ideals, call us to great work in the world. Each ofus alone can only do so much. Together, we can accomplish so much more. History will honor the high ideals of this organization. The charter states them with clarity: ""tosave succeeding generations from the scourge of war,"" ""to reaffirm faith in fundamentalhuman rights,"" ""to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom."" Let history also record that our generation of leaders followed through on these ideals, even inadversity. Let history show that in a decisive decade, members of the United Nations did not grow weary in our duties, or waver in meeting them. I'm confident that this young century will be liberty's century. I believe we will rise to this moment, because I know the character of somany nations and leaders represented here today. And I have faith in the transforming powerof freedom. May God bless you. 1 Full quotation: ""We do not accept the notion that democracy is a Western value.

"Thank you all. Thank you all for coming. We had a long night, and a great night. The voters turned out in record numbers and delivered an historic victory. Earlier today, Senator Kerry called with his congratulations. We had a really good phone call.He was very gracious. Senator Kerry waged a spirited campaign, and he and his supporterscan be proud of their efforts. Laura and I wish Senator Kerry and Teresa and their wholefamily all our best wishes. America has spoken, and I'm humbled by the trust and the confidence of my fellow citizens.With that trust comes a duty to serve all Americans, and I will do my best to fulfill that dutyevery day as your President. There are many people to thank, and my family comes first. Laura is the love of my life. I'm glad you love her, too. I want to thank our daughters, who joined their dad for his last campaign. I appreciate the hard work of my sister and my brothers. I especially want to thank my parents for their loving support. I'm grateful to the Vice-President and Lynne and their daughters, who have worked so hardand been such a vital part of our team. The Vice-President serves America with wisdom andhonor, and I'm proud to serve beside him. I want to thank my superb campaign team. I want to thank you all for your hard work. I wasimpressed every day by how hard and how skillful our team was. I want to thank our chairman Mark Racicot; the campaign manager, Ken Mehlman; thearchitect, Karl Rove. I want to thank Ed Gillespie for leading our Party so well. I want to thank the thousands of our supporters across our country. I want to thank you foryour hugs on the rope lines. I want to thank you for your prayers on the rope lines. I want tothank you for your kind words on the rope lines. I want to thank you for everything you did tomake the calls and to put up the signs, to talk to your neighbours, and to get out the vote. And because you did the incredible work, we are celebrating today. There's an old saying, ""Do not pray for tasks equal to your powers; pray for powers equal toyour tasks."" In four historic years, America has been given great tasks and faced them with strength andcourage. Our people have restored the vigor of this economy and shown resolve and patience in a newkind of war. Our military has brought justice to the enemy and honor to America. Our nation -- Our nation has defended itself and served the freedom of all mankind. I'm proudto lead such an amazing country, and I am proud to lead it forward. Because we have done the hard work, we are entering a season of hope. We'll continue oureconomic progress. We'll reform our outdated tax code. We'll strengthen the Social Security for the nextgeneration. We'll make public schools all they can be, and we will uphold our deepest values of family andfaith. We'll help the emerging democracies of Iraq and Afghanistan, so they can grow in strengthand defend their freedom, and then our servicemen and women will come home with thehonor they have earned. With good allies at our side, we will fight this war on terror with every resource of our nationalpower, so our children can live in freedom and in peace. Reaching these goals will require the broad support of Americans, so today I want to speak toevery person who voted for my opponent. To make this nation stronger and better, I will needyour support and I will work to earn it. I will do all I can do to deserve your trust. A new term is a new opportunity to reach out to the whole nation. We have one country, oneconstitution, and one future that binds us. And when we come together and work together,there is no limit to the greatness of America. Let me close with a word to the people of the state of Texas. We have known each other thelongest, and you started me on this journey. On the open plains of Texas, I first learned thecharacter of our country -- sturdy and honest, and as hopeful as the break of day. I willalways be grateful to the good people of my State. And whatever the road that lies ahead,that road will take me home. A campaign has ended, and the United States of America goes forward with confidence andfaith. I see a great day coming for our country, and I am eager for the work ahead. God bless you. And may God bless America.",bush
"Please be seated. Thank you all very much. Thanks for the warm welcome. Mr. Prime Minister, thank you, and Mrs. Martin, for a fantastic dinner last night in Ottawa. We really loved it. My only regret today is that Laura is not with me. She is -- went home to thank those who have been decorating the White House for the great Christmas season that's coming up. I marriedwell. I appreciate the Premiers who are here. Premier Hamm, thank you for your hospitality. Premier Lord, Premier Binns, and Premier Williams, I appreciate you all joining. I want to specifically mention the Premiers 'cause, as an ex-governor, I feel a special kinship to those who run the provinces here in Canada. But thank you for your service. Ambassador Cellucci, mayors, local officials, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, I am honored to be with you today to reaffirm America's enduring ties to your country. I am really glad to be in Canada, and I'm really glad to be among friends. I appreciate the warm hospitality we'vereceived. In the past year, I've come to know your new Prime Minister. We've met in Mexico, in the United States, in Chile, and now in Canada. Paul Martin is a leader who is asserting Canada's good influence in the world. And as I prepare for a second term in office, I look forward to asuccessful working partnership between our two countries. Paul and I share a great vision for the future, two prosperous, independent nations joinedtogether by the return of NHL hockey. I told Paul that I really have only one regret about this visit to Canada. There's a prominent citizen who endorsed me in the 2000 election, and I wanted a chance to finally thank him forthat -- that endorsement. I was hoping to meet Jean Poutine. I'm proud to stand in this historic place, which has welcomed home so many Canadians who defended liberty overseas, and where so many new Canadians began their North American dream. I'm grateful for the hospitality shown by the people of this fine city who have been sovery kind to Americans before. Three years ago, Halifax and other towns and villages -- from Newfoundland to Manitoba to the Northwest Territories to British Columbia -- welcomed, as the Prime Minister mentioned, more than 33,000 passengers on diverted flights. For days after September the 11th, Canadians came to the aid of men and women and children who were worried and confused and had nowhere to sleep. You opened your homes and your churches to strangers. You brought food; you set up clinics; you arranged for calls to their loved ones, and you asked fornothing in return. One American declared, ""My heart is overwhelmed at the outpouring of Canadian compassion. How does a person say 'thank you' to a nation?"" Well, that's something a President can do. And so let me say directly to the Canadian people, and to all of you here today who welcomedAmericans, thank you for your kindness to America in an hour of need. That emergency revealed the good and generous heart of this country, and showed the true feelings of Canadians and Americans toward each other. The affection that appeared in an instant will always be there, and it runs deep. Beyond the words of politicians and the naturaldisagreements that nations will have, our two peoples are one family, and always will be. We're united in part by the daily contact of commerce, and both our nations are better off for it. In the 10 years since the North American Free Trade Agreement was enacted, trade between the United States and Canada has nearly doubled. Twenty-three percent of America's exports go directly north; and more than 80 percent of Canadians' exports go to my country. With so much trade, there are bound to be some disagreements. I proudly ate some Alberta beef last night and I'm still standing. With determined efforts, and relying on sound science and mutual goodwill, we can resolve issues. Take, for example, those PEI potatoes. Right, Mr.Premier? Canada represents America's most vital trade relationship in the whole world, and we will doall that is necessary to keep that relationship strong. Yet, our ties go deeper than trade. Our community of values reaches back centuries. Canada and the U.S. may have disagreed on the wisdom of separating from the Crown, but we've always agreed on the great principles of liberty derived from our common heritage. We believe in the dignity of every human life, and we believe in the right of every person to live in freedom. We believe in free markets, humanized by compassion and fairness. We believe a diverse society can also be united by principles of justice and equality. The values we hold have made us good neighbors for centuries, and they will keep us as strong allies and goodfriends for the centuries to come. These shared convictions have also led our great democracies to accept a mission in the wider world. We know it is not possible to live in quiet isolation of our peaceful continent, hoping the problems and challenges of other nations will pass us by. We know there can be no security, no lasting peace in a world where proliferation and terrorism, and genocide, and extremepoverty go unopposed. We know that our own interests are served by an international system that advances human rights, and open societies, and free trade, and the rule of law, and the hope that comes from self-government. Both Canada and the United States have accepted important global duties,and we will meet those responsibilities, for our own benefit and for the good of mankind. Canada's leadership is helping to build a better world. Over the past decade, Canadian troops have helped bring stability to Bosnia and Kosovo. Canada's willingness to send peacekeepers to Haiti saved thousands of lives and helped save Haiti's constitutional government. Canadian troops are serving bravely in Afghanistan at this hour. Other Canadians stand on guard forpeace in the Middle East, in Cyprus, Sudan, and the Congo. Just two weeks ago, NATO countries showed their esteem for your military by electing General Ray Henault as Chairman of NATO's Military Committee. This admiration for your armed forces goes way back, and for good reason. It was said during World War I, the Canadians never budge. America respects the skill and honor and the sacrifice of Canadians' armed -- Canada'sarmed forces. Our nations play independent roles in the world, yet our purposes are complementary. We have important work ahead. A new term in office is an important opportunity to reach out to our friends. I hope to foster a wide international consensus among three great goals. The first great commitment is to defend our security and spread freedom by building effectivemultinational and multilateral institutions and supporting effective multilateral action. The tasks of the 21st century, from fighting proliferation to fighting the scourge of HIV/AIDS, to fighting poverty and hungry [sic] cannot be accomplished by a single nation alone. The United States and Canada participate together in more multilateral institutions than perhaps any two nations on Earth -- from NATO in Europe to the OAS in the Western Hemisphere to APEC in the Pacific. Canada and the United States are working with a coalition of nations through the Proliferation Security Initiative to stop and seize shipments of weapons of massdestruction, materials and delivery systems on land and at sea and in the air. America always prefers to act with allies at our side, and we're grateful to Canada for working closely with us to confront the challenges of Iran and North Korea. Multilateral organizationscan do great good in the world. Yet, the success of multilateralism is measured not merely by following a process, but by achieving results. The objective of the U.N. and other institutions must be collective security, not endless debate. For the sake of peace, when those bodies promise serious consequences, serious consequences must follow. America and Canada helped create the United Nations, and because we remain committed to that institution, we want it to be more than a League ofNations. My country is determined to work as far as possible within the framework of international organizations, and we're hoping that other nations will work with us to make those institutionsmore relevant and more effective in meeting the unique threats of our time. Our second commitment is to fight global terrorism with every action and resource the task requires. Canada has taken a series of critical steps to guard against the danger of terrorism. You created the Department of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness. You've toughened your anti-terror laws. You're upgrading your intelligence. I want to thank the government forall those constructive and important decisions. Our two countries are working together every day -- every day -- to keep our people safe. That is the most solemn duty I have, and the most solemn duty the Prime Minister has. From the smart border accord to the container security initiative to the joint command of NORAD, we are working together. I hope we'll also move forward on ballistic missile defense cooperation to protect the next generation of Canadians and Americans from the threats weknow will arise. The energetic defense of our nations is an important duty. Yet, defense alone is not a sufficient strategy. On September the 11th, the people of North America learned that the two vast oceans and friendly neighbors cannot fully shield us from the dangers of the 21st century. There's only one way to deal with enemies who plot in secret and set out to murder the innocent and the unsuspecting: We must take the fight to them. We must be relentlessand we must be steadfast in our duty to protect our people. Both of the countries have learned this lesson. In the early days of World War II, when the United States was still wrestling with isolationism, Canadian forces were already engaging the enemies of freedom from the Atlantic -- across the Atlantic. At the time, some Canadians argued that Canada had not been attacked and had no interest in fighting a distant war. Your Prime Minister, McKenzie King, gave this answer: ""We cannot defend our country and save our homes and families by waiting for the enemy to attack us. To remain on the defensive is the surest way to bring the war to Canada. Of course, we should protect our coasts and strengthen our ports and cities against attack,"" but the Prime Minister went on to say, ""we must also go out and meet the enemy before he reaches our shores. We must defeat him before he attacks us, before our cities are laid to waste."" McKenzie King was correct then, and we must always remember the wisdom of his wordstoday. In the new era the threat is different, but our duties are the same. Our enemies have declared their intentions -- and so have we. Peaceful nations must keep the peace by going after the terrorists and disrupting their plans and cutting off their funding. We must hold the sponsors of terror equally responsible for terrorist acts. We must prevent outlaw regimes from gaining weapons of mass destruction and providing them to terrorists. We must stay at these effortswith patience and resolve, until we prevail. Our third great commitment is to enhance our own security by promoting freedom and hope and democracy in the broader Middle East. The United States and Canada and all free nations need to look ahead. If, 20 years from now, the Middle East is dominated by dictators and mullahs who build weapons of mass destruction and harbor terrorists, our children and ourgrandchildren will live in a nightmare world of danger. That must not happen. By taking the side of reformers and democrats in the Middle East, we will gain allies in the war on terror, and isolate the ideology of murder and help to defeat the despair and hopelessnessthat feeds terror. The world will become a much safer place as democracy advances. For decades of tyranny and neglect in the broader Middle East, progress toward freedom will not come easily. I know that. Yet, it is cultural condescension to claim that some peoples orsome cultures or some religions are destined to despotism and unsuited for self-government. Today in the Middle East, the doubters and pessimists are being proven wrong. We're seeing movement toward elections, and greater rights for women, and open discussion of peaceful reform. I believe that people across the Middle East are weary of poverty and oppression and plead in silence for their liberty. I believe this is an historic moment in the broader MiddleEast, and we must seize this moment by standing with everyone who stands for liberty. We're standing with the people of Afghanistan, a nation that has gone from a safe haven for terrorists to a steadfast ally in the war on terror in three-and-a-half short years. Canada deployed more than 7,000 troops and much of your navy in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. This year, your country has led the International Security Assistance Force in Kabul. The coalition we share is doing honorable work; yet democracy is taking hold in that country because the Afghan people, like people everywhere, want to live in freedom. They registered by the millions to vote in October. They stood in long lines on election day. An Afghan widow brought all four of her daughters to vote alongside her. She said, ""When you see women here lined up to vote, this is something profound. I never dreamed this day would come."" But that woman's dream finally arrived, as it will one day across the Middle East. These are unprecedented, historic events that many said would never come. And Canadians can beproud of the part you have played in the advance of human liberty. We must also stand with the brave people of Iraq who are preparing for elections on January the 30th. Sometimes, even the closest of friends disagree. And two years ago, we disagreed about the best course of action in Iraq. Yet, as your Prime Minister made clear in Washington earlier this year, there is no disagreement at all with what has to be done in going forward. We must help the Iraqi people secure their country and build a free and democratic society. The Canadian government has pledged more than 200 million dollars in humanitarian aid and reconstruction assistance, and agreed to relieve more than 450 million dollars in Iraqi debt.That help is greatly appreciated. There's more work to be done together. Both Canada and the United States, and all free nations, have a vital interest in the success of a free Iraq. The terrorists have made Iraq the central front in the war on terror because they know what is at stake. When a free and democratic society is established in Iraq, in the heart of the Middle East, it will be a decisive blow to their aspirations to dominate the region and its people. A free Iraq will be a standingrebuke to radicalism, and a model to reformers from Damascus to Tehran. In Fallujah and elsewhere, our coalition and Iraqi forces are on the offensive and we are delivering a message: Freedom, not oppression, is the future of Iraq. Freedom is a precious right for every individual, regardless of the color of their skin or the religion they may hold. A long night of terror and tyranny in that region is ending, and a new day of freedom and hopeand self-government is on the way. And we will stand with the Palestinian and Israeli peoples and help end the destructive conflict between them. Prime Minister Martin has expressed the desire of his government to take a broader role in the quest for peace and democracy, and America welcomes your involvement.It's a time of change and a time of hope in that region. We seek justice and dignity, and a viable independent and democratic state for the Palestinian people. We seek security and peace for the state of Israel, a state that Canada, like America, first recognized in 1948. These are worthy goals in themselves, and by reaching them, we willalso remove an excuse for hatred and violence in the broader Middle East. Achieving peace in the Holy Land is not just a matter of pressuring one side or the other on the shape of a border or the site of a settlement. This approach has been tried before, without success. As we negotiate the details of peace, we must look to the heart of the matter, which is the need for a Palestinian democracy. The Palestinian people deserve a peaceful government that truly serves their interests, and the Israeli people need a true partner inpeace. Our destination is clear: two states, Israel and Palestine, living side-by-side in peace and security. And that destination can be reached by only one path, the path of democracy and reform and the rule of law. If all parties will apply effort, if all nations who are concerned about this issue will apply goodwill, this conflict can end and peace can be achieved. And thetime for that effort and the time for that goodwill is now. The United States and Canada face common threats in our world, and we share common goals that can transform our world. We're bound by history and geography and trade, and by our deepest convictions. With so much in common and so much at stake, we cannot be divided. I realize, and many Americans realize, that it's not always easy to sleep next to the elephant. Sometimes, our laws and our actions affect Canada every bit as much as they affect us, and we need to remember that. And when frustrations are vented, we must not take it personally. As a member of Canada's Parliament said in the 1960s, ""The United States is our friend,whether we like it or not."" When all is said and done, we are friends -- and we like it. Three years ago, when the American planes were diverted away from home, passengers knew they were safe and welcome the moment they saw the Maple Leaf flag. One of them later said of the Canadians he met, ""They taught me the meaning of the word, 'friend.'"" For generations,the nation of Canada has defined the word, ""friend,"" and my country is grateful. God has blessed America in many ways. God has blessed us 'cause we have neighbors likeyou. And today, I ask that God continues to bless the people of Canada. Thank you.",bush
"On this day, prescribed by law and marked by ceremony, we celebrate the durable wisdom of our Constitution, and recall the deep commitments that unite our country. I am grateful for the honor of this hour, mindful of the consequential times in which we live, and determined tofulfill the oath that I have sworn and you have witnessed. At this second gathering, our duties are defined not by the words I use, but by the history we have seen together. For a half century, America defended our own freedom by standing watch on distant borders. After the shipwreck of communism came years of relative quiet, years ofrepose, years of sabbatical - and then there came a day of fire. We have seen our vulnerability - and we have seen its deepest source. For as long as whole regions of the world simmer in resentment and tyranny - prone to ideologies that feed hatred and excuse murder - violence will gather, and multiply in destructive power, and cross the most defended borders, and raise a mortal threat. There is only one force of history that can break the reign of hatred and resentment, and expose the pretensions of tyrants, and rewardthe hopes of the decent and tolerant, and that is the force of human freedom. We are led, by events and common sense, to one conclusion: The survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands. The best hope for peace inour world is the expansion of freedom in all the world. America's vital interests and our deepest beliefs are now one. From the day of our Founding, we have proclaimed that every man and woman on this earth has rights, and dignity, and matchless value, because they bear the image of the Maker of Heaven and earth. Across the generations we have proclaimed the imperative of self-government, because no one is fit to be a master, and no one deserves to be a slave. Advancing these ideals is the mission that created our Nation. It is the honorable achievement of our fathers. Now it is the urgentrequirement of our nation's security, and the calling of our time. So it is the policy of the United States to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture, with the ultimate goal of endingtyranny in our world. This is not primarily the task of arms, though we will defend ourselves and our friends by force of arms when necessary. Freedom, by its nature, must be chosen, and defended by citizens, and sustained by the rule of law and the protection of minorities. And when the soul of a nation finally speaks, the institutions that arise may reflect customs and traditions very different from our own. America will not impose our own style of government on the unwilling. Our goal instead is to help others find their own voice, attain their own freedom, and maketheir own way. The great objective of ending tyranny is the concentrated work of generations. The difficulty of the task is no excuse for avoiding it. America's influence is not unlimited, but fortunately for the oppressed, America's influence is considerable, and we will use it confidently in freedom'scause. My most solemn duty is to protect this nation and its people against further attacks and emerging threats. Some have unwisely chosen to test America's resolve, and have found itfirm. We will persistently clarify the choice before every ruler and every nation: The moral choice between oppression, which is always wrong, and freedom, which is eternally right. America will not pretend that jailed dissidents prefer their chains, or that women welcome humiliationand servitude, or that any human being aspires to live at the mercy of bullies. We will encourage reform in other governments by making clear that success in our relations will require the decent treatment of their own people. America's belief in human dignity will guide our policies, yet rights must be more than the grudging concessions of dictators; they are secured by free dissent and the participation of the governed. In the long run, there is nojustice without freedom, and there can be no human rights without human liberty. Some, I know, have questioned the global appeal of liberty - though this time in history, four decades defined by the swiftest advance of freedom ever seen, is an odd time for doubt. Americans, of all people, should never be surprised by the power of our ideals. Eventually, the call of freedom comes to every mind and every soul. We do not accept the existence of permanent tyranny because we do not accept the possibility of permanent slavery. Liberty willcome to those who love it. Today, America speaks anew to the peoples of the world: All who live in tyranny and hopelessness can know: the United States will not ignore your oppression, or excuse your oppressors. When you stand for your liberty, we will stand withyou. Democratic reformers facing repression, prison, or exile can know: America sees you for whoyou are: the future leaders of your free country. The rulers of outlaw regimes can know that we still believe as Abraham Lincoln did: ""Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves; and, under the rule of a just God,cannot long retain it."" The leaders of governments with long habits of control need to know: To serve your people you must learn to trust them. Start on this journey of progress and justice, and America willwalk at your side. And all the allies of the United States can know: we honor your friendship, we rely on your counsel, and we depend on your help. Division among free nations is a primary goal of freedom's enemies. The concerted effort of free nations to promote democracy is a prelude toour enemies' defeat. Today, I also speak anew to my fellow citizens: From all of you, I have asked patience in the hard task of securing America, which you have granted in good measure. Our country has accepted obligations that are difficult to fulfill, and would be dishonorable to abandon. Yet because we have acted in the great liberating tradition of this nation, tens of millions have achieved their freedom. And as hope kindles hope, millions more will find it. By our efforts, we have lit a fire as well - a fire in the minds of men. It warms those who feel its power, it burns those who fight its progress, and one day thisuntamed fire of freedom will reach the darkest corners of our world. A few Americans have accepted the hardest duties in this cause - in the quiet work of intelligence and diplomacy ... the idealistic work of helping raise up free governments ... the dangerous and necessary work of fighting our enemies. Some have shown their devotion to our country in deaths that honored their whole lives - and we will always honor their namesand their sacrifice. All Americans have witnessed this idealism, and some for the first time. I ask our youngest citizens to believe the evidence of your eyes. You have seen duty and allegiance in the determined faces of our soldiers. You have seen that life is fragile, and evil is real, and courage triumphs. Make the choice to serve in a cause larger than your wants, larger than yourself - and in your days you will add not just to the wealth of our country, but to itscharacter. America has need of idealism and courage, because we have essential work at home - the unfinished work of American freedom. In a world moving toward liberty, we are determined toshow the meaning and promise of liberty. In America's ideal of freedom, citizens find the dignity and security of economic independence, instead of laboring on the edge of subsistence. This is the broader definition of liberty that motivated the Homestead Act, the Social Security Act, and the G.I. Bill of Rights. And now we will extend this vision by reforming great institutions to serve the needs of our time. To give every American a stake in the promise and future of our country, we will bring the highest standards to our schools, and build an ownership society. We will widen the ownership of homes and businesses, retirement savings and health insurance - preparing our people for the challenges of life in a free society. By making every citizen an agent of his or her own destiny, we will give our fellow Americans greater freedom from want and fear, and make our societymore prosperous and just and equal. In America's ideal of freedom, the public interest depends on private character - on integrity, and tolerance toward others, and the rule of conscience in our own lives. Self-government relies, in the end, on the governing of the self. That edifice of character is built in families, supported by communities with standards, and sustained in our national life by the truths of Sinai, the Sermon on the Mount, the words of the Koran, and the varied faiths of our people. Americans move forward in every generation by reaffirming all that is good and true thatcame before - ideals of justice and conduct that are the same yesterday, today, and forever. In America's ideal of freedom, the exercise of rights is ennobled by service, and mercy, and a heart for the weak. Liberty for all does not mean independence from one another. Our nation relies on men and women who look after a neighbor and surround the lost with love. Americans, at our best, value the life we see in one another, and must always remember that even the unwanted have worth. And our country must abandon all the habits of racism, because we cannot carry the message of freedom and the baggage of bigotry at the sametime. From the perspective of a single day, including this day of dedication, the issues and questions before our country are many. From the viewpoint of centuries, the questions that come to us are narrowed and few. Did our generation advance the cause of freedom? And did ourcharacter bring credit to that cause? These questions that judge us also unite us, because Americans of every party and background, Americans by choice and by birth, are bound to one another in the cause of freedom. We have known divisions, which must be healed to move forward in great purposes - and I will strive in good faith to heal them. Yet those divisions do not define America. We felt the unity and fellowship of our nation when freedom came under attack, and our response came like a single hand over a single heart. And we can feel that same unity and pride whenever America acts for good, and the victims of disaster are given hope, and the unjustencounter justice, and the captives are set free. We go forward with complete confidence in the eventual triumph of freedom. Not because history runs on the wheels of inevitability; it is human choices that move events. Not because we consider ourselves a chosen nation; God moves and chooses as He wills. We have confidence because freedom is the permanent hope of mankind, the hunger in dark places, the longing of the soul. When our Founders declared a new order of the ages; when soldiers died in wave upon wave for a union based on liberty; when citizens marched in peaceful outrage under the banner ""Freedom Now"" - they were acting on an ancient hope that is meant to be fulfilled. History has an ebb and flow of justice, but history also has a visible direction,set by liberty and the Author of Liberty. When the Declaration of Independence was first read in public and the Liberty Bell was sounded in celebration, a witness said, ""It rang as if it meant something."" In our time it means something still. America, in this young century, proclaims liberty throughout all the world, and to all the inhabitants thereof. Renewed in our strength - tested, but not weary - weare ready for the greatest achievements in the history of freedom. May God bless you, and may He watch over the United States of America.",bush
"Well, thank you all very much for that warm welcome. Laura and I are honored to be here this morning. I did a pretty good job when it came to picking my wife, by the way. She's going tobe a fabulous First Lady. Mr. Vice President, it's good to see you; of course, your wife, Lynn. And I want to thank the members of my Cabinet who are here. I appreciate you, Senator Frist, for your commitment and strong comments. And, Zach, thanks for your introduction. And thank you both fororganizing this important event. I want to thank the members of the House and the Senate who are here. I appreciate the number of foreign dignitaries who are here. It just goes to show that faith crosses everyborder, and touches every heart in every nation. Every President since the first one I can remember, Dwight Eisenhower, has taken part in this great tradition. It's a privilege for me to speak where they have spoken, and to pray where they have prayed. All Presidents of the United States have come to the National Prayer Breakfast, regardless of their religious views. No matter what our background, in prayer we share something universal -- a desire to speak and listen to our Maker, and to know His planfor our lives. America's Constitution forbids a religious test for office, and that's the way it should be. An American President serves people of every faith, and serves some of no faith at all. Yet I have found my faith helps me in the service to people. Faith teaches humility. As Laura would say, I ""could use a dose occasionally."" A recognition that we are small in God's universe, yet precious in His sight. It has sustained me in moments of success, and in moments ofdisappointment. Without it I'd be a different person, and without it I doubt I'd be here today. There are many experiences of faith in this room. But most of us share a belief that we are loved, and called to love; that our choices matter, now and forever; that there are purposes deeper than ambition and hopes greater than success. These beliefs shape our lives and help sustain the life of our nation. Men and women can be good without faith, but faith is a force of goodness. Men and women can be compassionate without faith, but faith often inspirescompassion. Human beings can love without faith, but faith is a great teacher of love. Our country, from its beginnings has recognized the contribution of faith. We do not impose any religion; we welcome all religions. We do not prescribe any prayer; we welcome all prayer[s]. This is the tradition of our nation, and it will be the standard of my Administration. We will respect every creed. We will honor the diversity of our country and the deepconvictions of our people. There's a good reason why many in our nation embrace the faith tradition. Throughout our history people of faith have often been our nation's voice of conscience. The foes of slavery could appeal to the standard that all are created equal in the sight of our Lord. The civil rights movement had the same conviction on its side -- that men and women bearing God's image should not be exploited and set aside, and treated as insignificant. The same impulse over the years has reformed prisons and mental institutions, hospitals, hospices, and homelessshelters. The Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. said this: ""The church must be reminded that it is not the master or the servant of the state, but rather the conscience of the state.""1 As in his case, that sometimes means defying the times, challenging old ways and old assumptions. This influence has made our nation more just and generous and decent. And our nation has needof that today. Faith remains an important -- remains important to the compassion of our nation. Millions of Americans serve their neighbor because they love their God. Their lives are characterized by kindness and patience, and service to others. They do for others what no government really can ever do -- no government program can really ever do: They provide love for anotherhuman being. They provide hope even when hope comes hard. In my second week in office we have set out to promote the work of community and faith- based charities. We want to encourage the inspired, to help the helper. Government cannot bereplaced by charities, but it can welcome them as partners instead of resenting them as rivals. My Administration will put the federal government squarely on the side of America's armies of compassion. Our plan will not favor religious institutions over non-religious institutions. As President, I'm interested in what is constitutional, and I'm interested in what works. The days of discriminating against religious institutions, simply because they are religious, must cometo an end. Faith is also important to the civility of our country. It teaches us not merely to tolerate one another, but to respect one another -- to show a regard for different views and the courtesy to listen. This is essential to democracy. It is also the proper way to treat human beings createdin the divine image. We will have our disagreements. Civility does not require us to abandon deeply-held beliefs. Civility does not demand casual creeds and colorless convictions. Americans have always believed that civility and firm resolve could live easily with one another. But civility does mean that our public debate ought to be free from bitterness and anger and rancor and ill-will. We have an obligation to make our case, not to demonize our opponents. As the Book of Jamesreminds us, fresh water and salt water cannot flow from the same spring.2 I'm under no illusion that civility will triumph in this city all at once. Old habits die hard -- and sometimes they never die at all. But I can only pledge to you this; that I will do my very bestto promote civility, and ask for the same in return. These are some of the crucial contributions of faith to our nation: justice, and compassion, and a civil and generous society. I thank you all here for displaying these values, and defending them, here in America and across the world. You strengthen the ties of friendshipand the ties of nation[s]. And I deeply appreciate your work. I believe in the power of prayer. It's been said: ""I would rather stand against the cannons of the wicked than against the prayers of the righteous."" The prayers of a friend are one of life's most gracious gifts. My family and I are blessed by the prayers of countless Americans. Over the last several months, Laura and I have been touched by the number of people who come up and say, ""We pray for you."" Such comforting words. I hope Americans will continue to praythat everyone in my Administration finds wisdom, and always remembers the common good. When President Harry Truman took office in 1945, he said this: ""At this moment, I have in my heart a prayer. I ask only to be a good and faithful servant of my Lord and my people.""3 Thishas been the prayer of many Presidents, and it is mine today. God bless. 1 Strength to Love (1963). 2 James 3:11-13: ""Can both fresh water and salt water flow from the same spring? My brothers and sisters, can a fig tree bear olives, or agrapevine bear figs? Neither can a salt spring produce fresh water."" [NIV] 3 Delivered in a speech to a Joint Session of Congress following the death of FDR",bush
"Thank you all. Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, members of Congress, fellow citizens: As a new Congress gathers, all of us in the elected branches of government share a great privilege: We've been placed in office by the votes of the people we serve. And tonight that is a privilege we share with newly elected leaders of Afghanistan, the Palestinian territories,Ukraine, and a free and sovereign Iraq. Two weeks ago, I stood on the steps of this Capitol and renewed the commitment of our nation to the guiding ideal of liberty for all. This evening I will set forth policies to advancethat ideal at home and around the world. Tonight, with a healthy, growing economy, with more Americans going back to work, with our nation an active force for good in the world, the state of our union is confident and strong. Our generation has been blessed by the expansion of opportunity, by advances in medicine, by the security purchased by our parents' sacrifice. Now, as we see a little gray in the mirror - - or a lot of gray -- and we watch our children moving into adulthood, we ask the question:What will be the state of their union? Members of Congress, the choices we make together will answer that question. Over the next several months, on issue after issue, let us do what Americans have always done and build abetter world for our children and our grandchildren. First, we must be good stewards of this economy and renew the great institutions on which millions of our fellow citizens rely. America's economy is the fastest growing of any major industrialized nation. In the past four years, we've provided tax relief to every person who pays income taxes, overcome a recession, opened up new markets abroad, prosecuted corporate criminals, raised homeownership to its highest level in history. And in the last yearalone, the United States has added 2.3 million new jobs. When action was needed, the Congress delivered, and the nation is grateful. Now we must add to these achievements. By making our economy more flexible, more innovative and morecompetitive, we will keep America the economic leader of the world. America's prosperity requires restraining the spending appetite of the federal government. I welcome the bipartisan enthusiasm for spending discipline. I will send you a budget that holds the growth of discretionary spending below inflation, makes tax relief permanent, and stays on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009. My budget substantially reduces or eliminates more than 150 government programs that are not getting results, or duplicate current efforts, or do not fulfill essential priorities. The principle here is clear: Taxpayer dollars must be spent wiselyor not at all. To make our economy stronger and more dynamic, we must prepare a rising generation to fill the jobs of the 21st century. Under the No Child Left Behind Act, standards are higher, test scores are on the rise, and we're closing the achievement gap for minority students. Now we must demand better results from our high schools so every high school diploma is a ticket to success. We will help additional -- an additional 200,000 workers to get training for a better career by reforming our job-training system and strengthening America's community colleges. And we will make it easier for Americans to afford a college education by increasing the size ofPell Grants. To make our economy stronger and more competitive, America must reward, not punish, the efforts and dreams of entrepreneurs. Small business is the path of advancement, especially for women and minorities. So we must free small businesses from needless regulation andprotect honest job creators from junk lawsuits. Justice is distorted and our economy is held back by irresponsible class actions and frivolousasbestos claims. And I urge Congress to pass legal reforms this year. To make our economy stronger and more productive, we must make health care more affordable and give families greater access to good coverage and more control over theirhealth decisions. I -- I ask Congress to move forward on a comprehensive health-care agenda with tax credits to help low-income workers buy insurance; a community health center in every poor county; improved information technology to prevent medical error and needless costs; association health plans for small businesses and their employees, expanded health savings accounts, and medical liability reform that will reduce health-care costs and make sure patients have thedoctors and care they need. To keep our economy growing, we also need reliable supplies of affordable, environmentally responsible energy. Nearly four years ago, I submitted a comprehensive energy strategy that encourages conservation, alternative sources, a modernized electricity grid and moreproduction here at home, including safe, clean nuclear energy. My Clear Skies legislation will cut power-plant pollution and improve the health of our citizens. And my budget provides strong funding for leading-edge technology, from hydrogen-fueled cars to clean coal to renewable sources such as ethanol. Four years of debate is enough. I urge Congress to pass legislation that makes America more secure and less dependent onforeign energy. All these proposals are essential to expand this economy and add new jobs, but they are just the beginning of our duty. To build the prosperity of future generations, we must update institutions that were created to meet the needs of an earlier time. Year after year, Americans are burdened by an archaic, incoherent federal tax code. I've appointed a bipartisan panel to examine the tax code from top to bottom. And when their recommendations are delivered, you and I will work together to give this nation a tax code that is pro-growth, easy tounderstand, and fair to all. America's immigration system is also outdated -- unsuited to the needs of our economy and to the values of our country. We should not be content with laws that punish hardworking people who want only to provide for their families, and deny businesses willing workers, and invite chaos at our border. It is time for an immigration policy that permits temporary guest workers to fill jobs Americans will not take, that rejects amnesty, that tells us who is entering andleaving our country, and that closes the border to drug dealers and terrorists. One of America's most important institutions -- a symbol of the trust between generations -- is also in need of wise and effective reform. Social Security was a great moral success of the 20th century, and we must honor its great purposes in this new century. The system, however, on its current path, is headed toward bankruptcy. And so we must join together to strengthen and save Social Security. Today, more than 45 million Americans receive Social Security benefits, and millions more are nearing retirement. And for them, the system issound and fiscally strong. I have a message for every American who is 55 or older: Do not let anyone mislead you. Foryou, the Social Security system will not change in any way. For younger workers, the Social Security system has serious problems that will grow worse with time. Social Security was created decades ago, for a very different era. In those days, people did not live as long, benefits were much lower than they are today, and a half centuryago, about 16 workers paid into the system for each person drawing benefits. Our society has changed in ways the founders of Social Security could not have foreseen. In today's world, people are living longer and therefore drawing benefits longer. And those benefits are scheduled to rise dramatically over the next few decades. And instead of 16 workers paying in for every beneficiary, right now it's only about three workers. And over the next few decades, that number will fall to just two workers per beneficiary. With each passing year, fewer workers are paying ever- higher benefits to an ever-larger numberof retirees. So here is the result: Thirteen years from now, in 2018, Social Security will be paying out more than it takes in. And every year afterward will bring a new shortfall, bigger than the year before. For example, in the year 2027, the government will somehow have to come up with an extra 200 billion dollars to keep the system afloat. And by 2033, the annual shortfall would be more than 300 billion dollars. By the year 2042, the entire system would be exhausted and bankrupt. If steps are not taken to avert that outcome, the only solutions would be dramatically higher taxes, massive new borrowing, or sudden and severe cuts in SocialSecurity benefits or other government programs. I recognize that 2018 and 2042 may seem a long way off. But those dates aren't so distant, as any parent will tell you. If you have a 5-year-old, you're already concerned about how you'll pay for college tuition 13 years down the road. If you've got children in their 20s, as some of us do, the idea of Social Security collapsing before they retire does not seem like asmall matter. And it should not be a small matter to the United States Congress. You and I share a responsibility. We must pass reforms that solve the financial problems of Social Security once and for all. Fixing Social Security permanently will require an open, candid review of the options. Some have suggested limiting benefits for wealthy retirees. Former Congressman Tim Penny has raised the possibility of indexing benefits to prices rather than wages. During the 1990s, my predecessor, President Clinton, spoke of increasing the retirement age. Former Senator John Breaux suggested discouraging early collection of Social Security benefits. The late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan recommended changing the waybenefits are calculated. All these ideas are on the table. I know that none of these reforms would be easy. But we have to move ahead with courage and honesty, because our children's retirement security is more important than partisanpolitics. I will work with members of Congress to find the most effective combination of reforms. I willlisten to anyone who has a good idea to offer. We must, however, be guided by some basic principles: - We must make Social Security permanently sound, not leave that task for another day. - We must not jeopardize our economic strength by increasing payroll taxes. - We must ensure that lower-income Americans get the help they need to have dignity andpeace of mind in their retirement. - We must guarantee that there is no change for those now retired or nearing retirement. - And we must take care that any changes in the system are gradual, so younger workershave years to prepare and plan for their future. As we fix Social Security, we also have the responsibility to make the system a better deal for younger workers. And the best way to reach that goal is through voluntary personalretirement accounts. Here is how the idea works: Right now, a set portion of the money you earn is taken out of your paycheck to pay for the Social Security benefits of today's retirees. If you're a younger worker, I believe you should be able to set aside part of that money in your own retirementaccount, so you can build a nest egg for your own future. Here is why the personal accounts are a better deal: Your money will grow, over time, at a greater rate than anything the current system can deliver. And your account will provide money for retirement over and above the check you will receive from Social Security. In addition, you'll be able to pass along the money that accumulates in your personal account, if you wish, to your children and -- or grandchildren. And best of all, the money in the account isyours, and the government can never take it away. The goal here is greater security in retirement, so we will set careful guidelines for personal accounts: We'll make sure the money can only go into a conservative mix of bonds and stock funds. We'll make sure that your earnings are not eaten up by hidden Wall Street fees. We'll make sure there are good options to protect your investments from sudden market swings onthe eve of your retirement. We'll make sure a personal account cannot be emptied out all at once, but rather paid out over time, as an addition to traditional Social Security benefits. And we'll make sure this plan is fiscally responsible by starting personal retirement accounts gradually and raising the yearly limits on contributions over time, eventually permitting all workers to set aside 4 percentage points of their payroll taxes in their accounts. Personal retirement accounts should be familiar to federal employees, because you already have something similar, called the Thrift Savings Plan, which lets workers deposit a portion of their paychecks into any of five different broadlybased investment funds. It's time to extend the same security and choice and ownership to young Americans. Our second great responsibility to our children and grandchildren is to honor and to pass along the values that sustain a free society. So many of my generation, after a long journey, have come home to family and faith, and are determined to bring up responsible, moral children.Government is not the source of these values, but government should never undermine them. Because marriage is a sacred institution and the foundation of society, it should not be redefined by activist judges. For the good of families, children and society, I support aconstitutional amendment to protect the institution of marriage. Because a society is measured by how it treats the weak and vulnerable, we must strive to build a culture of life. Medical research can help us reach that goal, by developing treatments and cures that save lives and help people overcome disabilities. And I thank the Congress for doubling the funding of the National Institutes of Health. To build a culture of life, we must also ensure that scientific advances always serve human dignity, not take advantage of somelives for the benefit of others. We should all be able to agree -- We should all be able to agree on some clear standards. I will work with Congress to ensure that human embryos are not created for experimentation or grown for body parts and that human life is never bought or sold as a commodity. America will continue to lead the world in medical research that is ambitious, aggressive, and alwaysethical. Because courts must always deliver impartial justice, judges have a duty to faithfully interpret the law, not legislate from the bench. As President, I have a constitutional responsibility to nominate men and women who understand the role of courts in our democracy and are well- qualified to serve on the bench, and I have done so. The Constitution also gives the Senate a responsibility: Every judicial nominee deserves anup-or-down vote. Because one of the deepest values of our country is compassion, we must never turn away from any citizen who feels isolated from the opportunities of America. Our government will continue to support faith-based and community groups that bring hope to harsh places. Now we need to focus on giving young people, especially young men in our cities, better optionsthan apathy or gangs or jail. Tonight I propose a three-year initiative to help organizations keep young people out of gangs and show young men an ideal of manhood that respects women and rejects violence. Taking on gang life will be one part of a broader outreach to at-risk youth, which involves parents and pastors, coaches and community leaders, in programs ranging from literacy to sports.And I am proud that the leader of this nationwide effort will be our First Lady, Laura Bush. Because HIV/AIDS brings suffering and fear into so many lives, I ask you to reauthorize the Ryan White Act to encourage prevention and provide care and treatment to the victims of that disease. And as we update this important law, we must focus our efforts on fellow citizenswith the highest rates of new cases: African-American men and women. Because one of the main sources of our national unity is our belief in equal justice, we need to make sure Americans of all races and backgrounds have confidence in the system that provides justice. In America we must make doubly sure no person is held to account for a crime he or she did not commit. So we are dramatically expanding the use of DNA evidence to prevent wrongful conviction. Soon I will send to Congress a proposal to fund special training for defense counsel in capitalcases, because people on trial for their lives must have competent lawyers by their side. Our third responsibility to future generations is to leave them an America that is safe from danger and protected by peace. We will pass along to our children all the freedoms we enjoy. And chief among them is freedom from fear. In the three and a half years since September the 11th, 2001, we've taken unprecedented actions to protect Americans. We've created a new department of government to defend our homeland, focused the FBI on preventing terrorism, begun to reform our intelligence agencies, broken up terror cells across the country, expanded research on defenses against biological and chemical attack, improved border security, and trained more than a half million first responders. Police and firefighters, air marshals, researchers and so many others are working every day to make our homelandsafer, and we thank them all. Our nation, working with allies and friends, has also confronted the enemy abroad with measures that are determined, successful, and continuing. The Al Qaida terror network that attacked our country still has leaders, but many of its top commanders have been removed. There are still governments that sponsor and harbor terrorists, but their number has declined. There are still regimes seeking weapons of mass destruction, but no longer without attention and without consequence. Our country is still the target of terrorists who want to kill manyand intimidate us all. And we will stay on the offensive against them until the fight is won. Pursuing our enemies is a vital commitment of the war on terror. And I thank the Congress for providing our service men and women with the resources they have needed. During this timeof war, we must continue to support our military and give them the tools for victory. Other nations around the globe have stood with us. In Afghanistan, an international force is helping provide security. In Iraq, 28 countries have troops on the ground. The United Nations and the European Union provided technical assistance for the elections. And NATO is leading amission to help train Iraqi officers. We're cooperating with 60 governments in the Proliferation Security Initiative to detect and stop the transit of dangerous materials. We're working closely with the governments in Asia to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions. Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and nine othercountries have captured or detained Al Qaida terrorists. In the next four years, my Administration will continue to build the coalitions that will defeat the dangers of our time. In the long term, the peace we seek will only be achieved by eliminating the conditions that feed radicalism and ideologies of murder. If whole regions of the world remain in despair and grow in hatred, they will be the recruiting grounds for terror, and that terror will stalk America and other free nations for decades. The only force powerful enough to stop the rise of tyranny and terror and replace hatred with hope is the force ofhuman freedom. Our enemies know this, and that is why the terrorist Zarqawi recently declared war on what he called the ""evil principle"" of democracy. And we've declared our own intention: America will stand with the allies of freedom to support democratic movements in the Middle East andbeyond, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world. The United States has no right, no desire, and no intention to impose our form of governmenton anyone else. That is one -- That is one of the main differences between us and our enemies. They seek to impose and expand an empire of oppression, in which a tiny group of brutal, self-appointed rulers control every aspect of every life. Our aim is to build and preserve a community of free and independent nations, with governments that answer to their citizens and reflect their owncultures. And because democracies respect their own people and their neighbors, the advance of freedom will lead to peace. That advance has great momentum in our time, shown by women voting in Afghanistan, and Palestinians choosing a new direction, and the people of Ukraine asserting their democratic rights and electing a president. We are witnessing landmark events in the history of liberty. And in the coming years, we will add to that story. The beginnings of reform and democracy in the Palestinian territories are now showing the power of freedom tobreak old patterns of violence and failure. Tomorrow morning, Secretary of State Rice departs on a trip that will take her to Israel and the West Bank for meetings with Prime Minister Sharon and President Abbas. She will discuss with them how we and our friends can help the Palestinian people end terror and build the institutions of a peaceful, independent, democratic state. To promote this democracy, I will ask Congress for 350 million dollars to support Palestinian political, economic and security reforms. The goal of two democratic states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace iswithin reach, and America will help them achieve that goal. To promote peace and stability in the broader Middle East, the United States will work with our friends in the region to fight the common threat of terror, while we encourage a higher standard of freedom. Hopeful reform is already taking hold in an arc from Morocco to Jordan to Bahrain. The government of Saudi Arabia can demonstrate its leadership in the region by expanding the role of its people in determining their future. And the great and proud nation of Egypt, which showed the way toward peace in the Middle East, can now show the way towarddemocracy in the Middle East. To promote peace in the broader Middle East, we must confront regimes that continue to harbor terrorists and pursue weapons of mass murder. Syria still allows its territory and parts of Lebanon to be used by terrorists who seek to destroy every chance of peace in the region.You have passed, and we are applying, the Syrian Accountability Act. And we expectthe Syrian government to end all support for terror and open the door to freedom. Today, Iran remains the world's primary state sponsor of terror -- pursuing nuclear weapons while depriving its people of the freedom they seek and deserve. We are working with European allies to make clear to the Iranian regime that it must give up its uranium enrichment program and any plutonium reprocessing and end its support for terror. And tothe Iranian people, I say tonight: As you stand for your own liberty, America stands with you. Our generational commitment to the advance of freedom, especially in the Middle East, is now being tested and honored in Iraq. That country is a vital front in the war on terror, which is why the terrorists have chosen to make a stand there. Our men and women in uniform arefighting terrorists in Iraq so we do not have to face them here at home. The victory of freedom in Iraq will strengthen a new ally in the war on terror, inspire democratic reformers from Damascus to Tehran, bring more hope and progress to a troubled region, and thereby lift a terrible threat from the lives of our children and grandchildren. We will succeed because the Iraqi people value their own liberty, as they showed the world last Sunday. Across Iraq, often at great risk, millions of citizens went to the polls and elected 275 men and women to represent them in a new transitional national assembly. A young woman in Baghdad told of waking to the sound of mortar fire on election day and wondering if it might be too dangerous to vote. She said, ""Hearing those explosions, it occurred to me, the insurgents are weak; they are afraid of democracy; they are losing. So I got my husband, andI got my parents, and we all came out and voted together."" Americans recognize that spirit of liberty, because we share it. In any nation, casting your vote is an act of civic responsibility. For millions of Iraqis, it was also an act of personalcourage, and they have earned the respect of us all. One of Iraq's leading democracy and human rights advocates is Safia Taleb al-Suhail. She says of her country, ""We were occupied for 35 years by Saddam Hussein. That was the real occupation. Thank you to the American people who paid the cost, but most of all to the soldiers."" Eleven years ago, Safia's father was assassinated by Saddam's intelligence service. Three days ago in Baghdad, Safia was finally able to vote for the leaders of her country. Andwe are honored that she is with us tonight. The terrorists and insurgents are violently opposed to democracy and will continue to attack it. Yet the terrorists' most powerful myth is being destroyed. The whole world is seeing that the car bombers and assassins are not only fighting coalition forces, they are trying to destroy the hopes of Iraqis, expressed in free elections. And the whole world now knows that a smallgroup of extremists will not overturn the will of the Iraqi people. We will succeed in Iraq because Iraqis are determined to fight for their own freedom and to write their own history. As Prime Minister Allawi said in his speech to Congress last September, ""Ordinary Iraqis are anxious to shoulder all the security burdens of our country as quickly as possible."" That is the natural desire of an independent nation, and it also is thestated mission of our coalition in Iraq. The new political situation in Iraq opens a new phase of our work in that country. At the recommendation of our commanders on the ground and in consultation with the Iraqi government, we will increasingly focus our efforts on helping prepare more capable Iraqisecurity forces -- forces with skilled officers and an effective command structure. As those forces become more self-reliant and take on greater security responsibilities, America and its coalition partners will increasingly be in a supporting role. In the end, Iraqis must be able to defend their own country, and we will help that proud, new nation secure its liberty. Recently an Iraqi interpreter said to a reporter, ""Tell America not to abandon us."" He and all Iraqis can be certain: While our military strategy is adapting to circumstances, our commitment remains firm and unchanging. We are standing for the freedom of our Iraqifriends, and freedom in Iraq will make America safer for generations to come. We will not set an artificial timetable for leaving Iraq, because that would embolden the terrorists and make them believe they can wait us out. We are in Iraq to achieve a result: a country that is democratic, representative of all its people, at peace with its neighbors and able to defend itself. And when that result is achieved, our men and women serving in Iraqwill return home with the honor they have earned. Right now, Americans in uniform are serving at posts across the world, often taking great risks on my orders. We have given them training and equipment. And they have given us anexample of idealism and character that makes every American proud. The volunteers of our military are unrelenting in battle, unwavering in loyalty, unmatched inhonor and decency, and every day they are making our nation more secure. Some of our service men and women have survived terrible injuries, and this grateful nationwill do everything we can to help them recover. And we have said farewell to some very good men and women who died for our freedom andwhose memory this nation will honor forever. One name we honor is Marine Corps Sergeant Byron Norwood of Pflugerville, Texas, who was killed during the assault on Fallujah. His mom, Janet, sent me a letter and told me how much Byron loved being a Marine and how proud he was to be on the front line against terror. She wrote, ""When Byron was home the last time, I said that I wanted to protect him like I had since he was born. He just hugged me and said, 'You've done your job, Mom. Now it is my turn to protect you.'"" Ladies and gentlemen, with grateful hearts, we honor freedom's defenders and our military families, represented here this evening by Sergeant Norwood'smom and dad, Janet and Bill Norwood. In these four years, Americans have seen the unfolding of large events. We have known times of sorrow and hours of uncertainty and days of victory. In all this history, even when we havedisagreed, we have seen threads of purpose that unite us. The attack on freedom in our world has reaffirmed our confidence in freedom's power to change the world. We're all part of a great venture: to extend the promise of freedom in our country, to renew the values that sustain our liberty and to spread the peace that freedombrings. As Franklin Roosevelt once reminded Americans, ""Each age is a dream that is dying or onethat is coming to birth."" And we live in the country where the biggest dreams are born. The abolition of slavery was only a dream -- until it was fulfilled. The liberation of Europe from fascism was only a dream -- until it was achieved. The fall of imperial communism was only a dream -- until, one day, it was accomplished. Our generation has dreams of its own, and we also go forward with confidence. The road ofprovidence is uneven and unpredictable, yet we know where it leads: It leads to freedom. Thank you. And may God bless America.",bush
"Thank you, all. Please be seated. It is great to be back to this fine university. Many great military leaders of the 20th century, from Dwight Eisenhower, to Colin Powell, studied on this campus. And today the National Defense University is training a new generation of leaders who will serve and defend this nation in a new century. Americans are grateful for yourdevotion to duty, and so is your Commander-in-Chief. I am honored that two influential and important members of the United States Congress have joined us. First, Senator Joe Lieberman, strong defender of freedom. Thank you for coming, Senator. And the Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Congressman Duncan Hunter. Proud you're here, Dunc. Thanks for coming. In the midst of what we hope will be thefinal snow blizzard of 2005, I'm honored you two men slushed here to this event. I appreciate so very much Lieutenant General Michael Dunn and his wife, Pam, for greeting me and for serving our nation. I want to thank all the National Defense University students for being here. I appreciate the staff for joining us. I want to thank the members of the diplomatic corps who have come today. It is an honor to see you all again. I want to thank my fellow Americans for caring about the subject of peace,and that's what I'm here to discuss. We meet at a time of great consequence for the security of our nation, a time when thedefense of freedom requires the advance of freedom, a time with echoes in our history. Twice in six decades, a sudden attack on the United States launched our country into a global conflict, and began a period of serious reflection on America's place in the world. The bombing of Pearl Harbor taught America that unopposed tyranny, even on far-away continents, could draw our country into a struggle for our own survival. And our reflection on that lesson led us to help build peaceful democracies in the ruins of tyranny, to unite free nations in the NATOAlliance, and to establish a firm commitment to peace in the Pacific that continues to this day. The attacks of September the 11th, 2001 also revealed the outlines of a new world. In one way, that assault was the culmination of decades of escalating violence -- from the killing of U.S. Marines in Beirut, to the bombing at the World Trade Center, to the attacks on American embassies in Africa, to the attacks on the USS Cole. In another way, September the 11th provided a warning of future dangers -- of terror networks aided by outlaw regimes, and ideologies that incite the murder of the innocent, and biological and chemical and nuclearweapons that multiply destructive power. Like an earlier generation, America is answering new dangers with firm resolve. No matter how long it takes, no matter how difficult the task, we will fight the enemy, and lift theshadow of fear, and lead free nations to victory. Like an earlier generation, America is pursuing a clear strategy with our allies to achieve victory. Our immediate strategy is to eliminate terrorist threats abroad, so we do not have to face them here at home. The theory here is straightforward: terrorists are less likely to endanger our security if they are worried about their own security. When terrorists spend their days struggling to avoid death or capture, they are less capable of arming and training to commit new attacks. We will keep the terrorists on the run, until they have nowhere left tohide. In three and a half years, the United States and our allies have waged a campaign of global scale -- from the mountains of Afghanistan, to the border regions of Pakistan, to the Horn of Africa, to the islands of the Philippines, to the plains of North Central Iraq. The al Qaeda terror network that attacked our country still has leaders, but many of its top commanders have been removed. There are still governments that sponsor and harbor terrorists, but their number has declined. There are still regimes seeking weapons of mass destruction -- but no longer without attention and without consequence. Our country is still the target of terrorists who want to kill many, and intimidate us all. We will stay on the offensive against them, untilthe fight is won. Members of our military are undertaking difficult missions, in some of the most dangerous and desolate parts of the world. These volunteers know the risks they face, and they know the cause they serve. As one Marine sergeant put it, ""I never want my children to experience what we saw in New York, at the Pentagon, and in Pennsylvania."" He said, ""If we can eliminate whatever threat we can on foreign soil, I would rather do it there than have it come [home] to us."" In this vital cause, some of our men and women in uniform have fallen, some have returned home with terrible injuries, and all who sacrifice will have the permanentgratitude of the United States of America. In this war on terror, America is not alone. Many governments have awakened to the dangers we share and have begun to take serious action. Global terror requires a global response, andAmerica is more secure today because dozens of other countries have stepped up to the fight. We're more secure because Pakistani forces captured more than one hundred extremists across the country last year, including operatives who were plotting attacks against the United States. We're more secure because Britain arrested an al Qaeda operative who had provided detailed casing reports on American targets to senior al Qaeda leaders. We're more secure because German authorities arrested extremists who were planning attacks against U.S. and coalition targets in Iraq. We're more secure because the Philippines' new Anti-Terrorism Task Force has helped capture more than a dozen terrorist suspects -- including seven members of al Qaeda and affiliated networks. We're more secure because Poland is leading a 15-nation multi-national division in Iraq, and forces from 23 countries have given their lives in thestruggle against terrorists and insurgents in Afghanistan and Iraq. Our allies in the war on terror are making tough decisions, and they're taking risks, and they're losing lives. These countries have proven themselves trusted friends and reliable allies. So I urge the Congress to pass the Solidarity Initiative I have proposed to stand by thecountries that are standing by us in the war on terror. Our strategy to keep the peace in the longer term is to help change the conditions that give rise to extremism and terror, especially in the broader Middle East. Parts of that region have been caught for generations in a cycle of tyranny and despair and radicalism. When a dictatorship controls the political life of a country, responsible opposition cannot develop, and dissent is driven underground and toward the extreme. And to draw attention away from their social and economic failures, dictators place blame on other countries and other races, and stir the hatred that leads to violence. This status quo of despotism and anger cannot be ignored or appeased, kept in a box or bought off, because we have witnessed how the violence in that region can reach easily across borders and oceans. The entire world has anurgent interest in the progress, and hope, and freedom in the broader Middle East. The advance of hope in the Middle East requires new thinking in the region. By now it should be clear that authoritarian rule is not the wave of the future; it is the last gasp of a discredited past. It should be clear that free nations escape stagnation, and grow stronger with time, because they encourage the creativity and enterprise of their people. It should be clear that economic progress requires political modernization, including honest representative government and the rule of law. And it should be clear that no society can advance with onlyhalf of its talent and energy -- and that demands the full participation of women. The advance of hope in the Middle East also requires new thinking in the capitals of great democracies -- including Washington, D.C. By now it should be clear that decades of excusing and accommodating tyranny, in the pursuit of stability, have only led to injustice and instability and tragedy. It should be clear that the advance of democracy leads to peace, because governments that respect the rights of their people also respect the rights of their neighbors. It should be clear that the best antidote to radicalism and terror is the tolerance and hope kindled in free societies. And our duty is now clear: For the sake of our long-term security, all free nations must stand with the forces of democracy and justice that have begunto transform the Middle East. Encouraging democracy in that region is a generational commitment. It's also a difficult commitment, demanding patience and resolve -- when the headlines are good and when the headlines aren't so good. Freedom has determined enemies, who show no mercy for the innocent, and no respect for the rules of warfare. Many societies in the region struggle with poverty and illiteracy, many rulers in the region have longstanding habits of control; manypeople in the region have deeply ingrained habits of fear. For all these reasons, the chances of democratic progress in the broader Middle East have seemed frozen in place for decades. Yet at last, clearly and suddenly, the thaw has begun. The people of Afghanistan have embraced free government, after suffering under one of the most backward tyrannies on earth. The voters in Iraq defied threats of murder, and have set their country on a path to full democracy. The people of the Palestinian Territories cast their ballots against violence and corruption of the past. And any who doubt the appeal of freedom in the Middle East can look to Lebanon, where the Lebanese people are demanding a free and independent nation. In the words of one Lebanese observer, ""Democracy is knocking at the door of this country and, if it's successful in Lebanon, it is going to ring the doors of everyArab regime."" Across the Middle East, a critical mass of events is taking that region in a hopeful new direction. Historic changes have many causes, yet these changes have one factor in common. A businessman in Beirut recently said, ""We have removed the mask of fear. We're not afraid anymore."" Pervasive fear is the foundation of every dictatorial regime -- the prop that holds up all power not based on consent. And when the regime of fear is broken, and the people find their courage and find their voice, democracy is their goal, and tyrants, themselves, havereason to fear. History is moving quickly, and leaders in the Middle East have important choices to make. The world community, including Russia and Germany and France and Saudi Arabia and the United States has presented the Syrian government with one of those choices -- to end its nearly 30- year occupation of Lebanon, or become even more isolated from the world. The Lebanese people have heard the speech by the Syrian president. They've seen these delaying tactics and half-measures before. The time has come for Syria to fully implement Security Council Resolution 1559. All Syrian military forces and intelligence personnel must withdraw beforethe Lebanese elections, for those elections to be free and fair. The elections in Lebanon must be fully and carefully monitored by international observers. The Lebanese people have the right to determine their future, free from domination by a foreign power. The Lebanese people have the right to choose their own parliament this spring, free of intimidation. And that new government will have the help of the international community in building sound political, economic, and military institutions, so the great nation of Lebanoncan move forward in security and freedom. Today I have a message for the people of Lebanon: All the world is witnessing your great movement of conscience. Lebanon's future belongs in your hands, and by your courage, Lebanon's future will be in your hands. The American people are on your side. Millions across the earth are on your side. The momentum of freedom is on your side, and freedom willprevail in Lebanon. America and other nations are also aware that the recent terrorist attack in Tel Aviv was conducted by a radical Palestinian group headquartered in Damascus. Syria, as well as Iran, has a long history of supporting terrorist groups determined to sow division and chaos in the Middle East, and there is every possibility they will try this strategy again. The time has come for Syria and Iran to stop using murder as a tool of policy, and to end all support forterrorism. In spite of attacks by extremists, the world is seeing hopeful progress in the Israel-Palestinian conflict. There is only one outcome that will end the tyranny, danger, violence and hopelessness, and meet the aspirations of all people in the region: We seek two democraticstates, Israel and Palestine, living side-by-side in peace and security. And that goal is within reach, if all the parties meet their responsibilities and if terrorism is brought to an end. Arab states must end incitement in their own media, cut off public and private funding for terrorism, stop their support for extremist education, and establish normal relations with Israel. Israel must freeze settlement activity, help the Palestinians build a thriving economy, and ensure that a new Palestinian state is truly viable, with contiguous territory on the West Bank. Palestinian leaders must fight corruption, encourage freeenterprise, rest true authority with the people, and actively confront terrorist groups. The bombing in Tel Aviv is a reminder that the fight against terrorists is critical to the search for peace and for Palestinian statehood. In an interview last week, Palestinian President Abbas strongly condemned the terrorist attack in Tel Aviv, declaring, ""Ending violence and security chaos is first and foremost a Palestinian interest."" He went on to say, ""We cannot build thefoundations of a state without the rule of law and public order."" President Abbas is correct. And so the United States will help the Palestinian Authority build the security services that current peace and future statehood require: security forces which are effective, responsive to civilian control, and dedicated to fighting terror and upholding the rule of law. We will coordinate with the government of Israel, with neighbors such as Egypt and Jordan, and with other donors to ensure that Palestinians get the training and equipment they need. The United States is determined to help the parties remove obstacles to progressand move forward in practical ways, so we can seize this moment for peace in the Holy Land. In other parts of the Middle East, we're seeing small but welcome steps. Saudi Arabia's recent municipal elections were the beginning of reform that may allow greater participation in the future. Egypt has now -- has now the prospect of competitive, multi-party elections for President in September. Like all free elections, these require freedom of assembly, multiple candidates, free access by those candidates to the media, and the right to form political parties. Each country in the Middle East will take a different path of reform. And every nationthat starts on that journey can know that America will walk at its side. Progress in the Middle East is threatened by weapons of mass destruction and their proliferation. Today, Great Britain, France, and Germany are involved in a difficult negotiation with Iran aimed at stopping its nuclear weapons program. We want our allies to succeed, because we share the view that Iran's acquisition of nuclear weapons would be destabilizing and threatening to all of Iran's neighbors. The Iranian regime should listen to the concerns of the world, and listen to the voice of the Iranian people, who long for their liberty and want their country to be a respected member of the international community. We look forward to the day when Iran joins in the hopeful changes taking place across the region. We lookforward to the day when the Iranian people are free. Iran and other nations have an example in Iraq. The recent elections have begun a process of debate and coalition building unique in Iraqi history, and inspiring to see. Iraq's leaders are forming a government that will oversee the next -- and critical -- stage in Iraq's political transition: the writing of a permanent constitution. This process must take place without external influence. The shape of Iraq's democracy must be determined by the Iraqis,themselves. Iraq's democracy, in the long run, must also be defended by Iraqis, themselves. Our goal is to help Iraqi security forces move toward self-reliance, and they are making daily progress. Iraqi forces were the main providers of security at about 5,000 polling places in the January elections. Our coalition is providing equipment and training to the new Iraqi military, yet theybring a spirit all of their own. Last month, when soldiers of the U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment were on combat patrol north of Baghdad, one of their Humvees fell into a canal, and Iraqi troops came to their rescue -- plunging into the water again and again, until the last American was recovered. The Army colonel in charge of the unit said, ""When I saw those Iraqis in the water, fighting to save their American brothers, I saw a glimpse of the future of this country."" One of the Iraqi soldiers commented, ""These people have come a hundred -- 10,000 miles to help my country. They've left their families and their children. If we can give them something back, just a little, we can show our thanks."" America is proud to defend freedom in Iraq, and proud to stand with thebrave Iraqis as they defend their own freedom. Three and a half years ago, the United States mourned our dead, gathered our resolve, and accepted a mission. We made a decision to stop threats to the American people before they arrive on our shores, and we have acted on that decision. We're also determined to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture,with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world. This objective will not be achieved easily, or all at once, or primarily by force of arms. We know that freedom, by definition, must be chosen, and that the democratic institutions of other nations will not look like our own. Yet we also know that our security increasingly depends on the hope and progress of other nations now simmering in despair and resentment.And that hope and progress is found only in the advance of freedom. This advance is a consistent theme of American strategy -- from the Fourteen Points, to the Four Freedoms, to the Marshall Plan, to the Reagan Doctrine. Yet the success of this approach does not depend on grand strategy alone. We are confident that the desire for freedom, even when repressed for generations, is present in every human heart. And that desire can emergewith sudden power to change the course of history. Americans, of all people, should not be surprised by freedom's power. A nation founded on the universal claim of individual rights should not be surprised when other people claim those rights. Those who place their hope in freedom may be attacked and challenged, but they will not ultimately be disappointed, because freedom is the design of humanity and freedom is thedirection of history. In our time, America has been attacked. America has been challenged. Yet the uncertainty, and sorrow, and sacrifice of these years have not been in vain. Millions have gained their liberty; and millions more have gained the hope of liberty that will not be denied. The trumpetof freedom has been sounded, and that trumpet never calls retreat. Before history is written in books, it is written in courage -- the courage of honorable soldiers; the courage of oppressed peoples; the courage of free nations in difficult tasks. Our generation is fortunate to live in a time of courage. And we are proud to serve in freedom'scause. May God bless you all",bush
"Thank you all for the warm welcome. It wasn't all that long ago that I brought my family over to go to church Easter Sunday here at Fort Hood. I've been looking forward to coming back and giving you a proper Army greeting: Hoo-ah! It's an honor to be with the courageous menand women of the ""Phantom Corps."" The soldiers and families of Fort Hood have contributed mightily to our efforts in the war on terror. Many of you have recently returned from Iraq. Welcome home -- and thank you for a job well-done. Others are preparing to head out this fall -- some for a second tour of duty. Whether you're coming or going, you are making an enormous difference for the security of our nation and for the peace of the world. I want to thank you for defending your fellow citizens. I want to thank you for extending liberty to millions. And I want to thank you formaking America proud. I especially want to thank the military families who are here today. I want to thank you for your sacrifices in the war on terror. It isn't easy being the one left behind when a loved one goes to war. You have a wonderful community here at Fort Hood. I thank you for the support you have given to each other. By loving and supporting a soldier, you are also serving our nation. Americans are grateful for your sacrifice and your service -- and so is yourCommander-in-Chief. I want to thank Lieutenant General Tom Metz, and his wife, Pam. I want to thank Command Sergeant Major Joe Gainey, and his lovely wife. I want to thank all the officers and soldiers of this fantastic base. I appreciate our fine Governor from the state of Texas, Governor Rick Perry, for joining us today. I want to thank Congressman John Carter and Congressman Chet Edwards for joining us today. I'm looking forward to giving them a ride back to Washingtonon Air Force One. I suspect they're looking forward to the ride back. I want to thank Major General Pete Chiarelli for being with us today, and his wife, Beth; Major General JD Thurman, and his wife, Dee; Command Sergeant Major Tom McMurtrie. And all thesoldiers, airmen, military families, veterans, friends of Fort Hood, and the Three Corps. This weekend we marked the two-year anniversary of the liberation of Baghdad. Coalition forces crossed more than 350 miles of desert to get there, pushing through dust storms and death squads. They reached the Iraqi capital in 21 days, and that achievement will be studiedfor generations as the fastest armored advance in military history. The coalition assault was rapid, and it wasn't easy. The enemy hid in schools and hospitals. They used civilians as human shields. Yet our troops persevered. We protected civilian lives while destroying the Republican Guard's Medina Division, pushing through the Karbala Gap,capturing Saddam International Airport, and, on April 9th, we liberated the Iraqi capital. For millions of Iraqis and Americans, it is a day they will never forget. The toppling of Saddam Hussein's statue in Baghdad will be recorded, alongside the fall of the Berlin Wall, as one of the great moments in the history of liberty. And eight months later, soldiers of the Ivy Division brought the real Saddam Hussein to justice. When Ironhorse soldiers left for Iraq, Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator sitting in a palace, and by the time you came home, hewas sitting in a prison cell. When it came time to drive the terrorists and insurgents from Fallujah, soldiers of the 1st Cavalry Division spearheaded the assault. The ""First Team"" was ""First in Fallujah"" -- and when the dust settled, what you found there reminds us why we are at war: Blood-stained torture chambers used by terrorists to execute hostages; you found videos of beheadings and brutal terrorist attacks; you found over 600 improvised explosive devices, including an ice creamtruck that had been loaded with bomb-making materials for a terrorist attack. The men and women of the Phantom Corps know why we are in Iraq. As one First Team soldier, Lieutenant Mike Erwin, put it: ""If we can start to change the most powerful country in the Middle East, the others will follow, and Americans 20 years down the road won't have todeal with a day like September the 11th, 2001."" The terrorists have made Iraq a central front in the war on terror. Because of your service, because of your sacrifice, we are defeating them there where they live, so we do not have to face them where we live. Because of you, the people of Iraq no longer live in fear of being executed and left in mass graves. Because of you, freedom is taking root in Iraq. Our successin Iraq will make America safer, for us and for future generations. In my liberation message to the Iraqi people, I made them a solemn promise: ""The government of Iraq, and the future of your country, will soon belong to you."" I went on to say: ""We will help you build a peaceful and representative government that protects the rightsof all citizens. And then our military forces will leave."" From the beginning, our goal in Iraq has been to promote Iraqi independence -- by helping the Iraqi people establish a free country that can sustain itself, rule itself, and defend itself. And in the last two years, Iraqis have made enormous progress toward that goal. Iraqis have laid the foundations of a free society, with hundreds of independent newspapers and dozens of political parties and associations, and schools that teach Iraqi children how to read and write, instead of the propaganda of Saddam Hussein. Iraqis have laid the foundation of a free economy, with a new currency and independent central bank, new laws to encourage foreigninvestment, and thousands of small businesses established since liberation. The troops from Fort Hood have done their part. In Baghdad, soldiers of the 1st Cavalry Division launched Operation Adam Smith, and the new generation of Iraqi entrepreneurs you helped nurture will create jobs and opportunities for millions of their fellow citizens. Iraqis have laid the foundation for a society built on the rule of law. Today, courts are functioning across Iraq, and hundreds of independent Iraqi judges have been trained in Bahrain andJordan and Czech Republic and Britain and Italy. An Iraqi special tribunal has been established that will try senior leadership, including Saddam Hussein. He will get the trial that he did not afford his fellow citizens when he was in power. Slowly but surely, the land that gave civilization the first written code of law is now restoringthe rule of law, and setting the example for people across the Middle East. Iraqis have laid a solid foundation for democratic self-government. The world watched in awe as the Iraqi people defied the car bombers and assassins to cast their votes in the country's first free and democratic election in decades. It took courage, the kind of courage displayed by a 29-year-old Iraqi policeman named Abdul Amir. On election day, Amir noticed a suspicious man walking toward the line of voters at a Baghdad polling station. With complete disregard for his own safety, he threw his arms around the man and dragged him into a nearby intersection, where the man detonated the belt of explosives that was wrapped around his body. Amir took the brunt of the blast, giving his own life to save scores of innocentcivilians. He is a hero of a free Iraq, and the world honors his valor and his sacrifice. Because of brave Iraqis like Abdul Amir, today the free nation of Iraq has elected a transitional assembly, a President and two Deputy Presidents, leaders who answer to thepeople, instead of the other way around. I've spoken with the new leaders of Iraq, President Talabani, as well as Speaker -- Assembly Speaker al-Hassani. I congratulated them on their achievement. I told them I look forward to working with the new government that will soon be established. I assured them that the United States will continue to stand with the Iraqi people as they take control of their destinyand assume the blessings of self-government. There's a lot of hard work ahead. The Iraqi people face brutal and determined enemies. But Iraqis are also determined, and they have the will to defeat the insurgency. The soldiers and police of a free Iraq learned on election day they can face down the insurgents, and they learned they can prevail. The Iraqi people now have confidence that the soldiers and police of a free Iraq have the courage and resolve to defend them. The Iraqi security forces are fighting bravely for the future of their country, and in the last six months alone, more than 800 havegiven their lives in the struggle. The soldiers of Fort Hood have seen their courage in action. Sergeant First Class Troy Hawkins recently put it, ""The Iraqis will stand and fight. I've seen guys with grenade fragments in them, bleeding, pulling people off the street and getting kids out of the way. Then they'll fight the enemy. They're determined to make this work."" And the United States is determined tohelp the Iraqis succeed. As Iraq's new government assumes increasing responsibility for the stability of their country, security operations are entering a new phase. Iraq security forces are becoming more self- reliant and taking on greater responsibilities. And that means that America and its coalition partners are increasingly playing more of a supporting role. Today, more than 150,000 Iraqi security forces have been trained and equipped, and for the first time, the Iraqi army, police and security forces now outnumberU.S. forces in Iraq. Like free people everywhere, Iraqis want to be defended and led by their own countrymen. We will help them achieve this objective so Iraqis can secure their own nation. And then ourtroops will come home with the honor they have earned. The Iraqi people know the sacrifices you are making. They're grateful to you. They are grateful to your families. One Iraqi army colonel put it this way: ""These U.S. soldiers leave their wives and kids to come here and give us freedom. We have to thank them for doing that for us."" You are making possible the peace of Iraq, and you are making possible the security of free nations. Yours is noble work, it's important work, and I thank you for assuming yourduty. As the Iraq democracy succeeds, that success is sending a message from Beirut to Tehran that freedom can be the future of every nation. The establishment of a free Iraq at the heart of the Middle East will be a crushing defeat to the forces of tyranny and terror, and awatershed event in the global democratic revolution. In the last two years, you have accomplished much, yet your work isn't over. Freedom still faces dangerous adversaries. Terrorists still want to attack our people. But they're losing. These terrorists are losing the struggle because they're under constant pressure from our Armed Forces, and they will remain under constant pressure from our Armed Forces. And they are losing the struggle because they are on the wrong side of history. Across the broader Middle East, the tide of freedom is surging. The people of Afghanistan have embraced free government, after suffering under one of the most backward tyrannies on Earth. The people of the Palestinian Territories cast their ballots against violence and corruption of the past. The people of Lebanon are rising up to demand their freedom and independence. Saudi Arabia has held its first municipal elections in decades. Egypt is taking its first steps on the path to democratic reform. A critical mass of events is taking that region in a hopeful new direction. And as freedom spreads in the Middle East and beyond, the American people will be safer andthe free world more secure. You have fought the battles in the war on terror, and you have served the cause of freedom.And you can be proud of all that you have achieved. This time of brave achievement is also a time of sacrifice. Many of our soldiers have returned from war with grave wounds that they will carry with them the rest of their lives. And America will fulfill its duty by providing them the best medical care possible. Still others have given their lives in this struggle -- your friends, your comrades. We honor their memory. We lift them up in prayer. Their sacrifice will always be remembered by a grateful nation. We can live as free people because men and women like you have stepped forward and havevolunteered to serve. I came here today to thank you in person for your courageous choice of service. You're making America proud. You're making America free. And you're making the world more peaceful. I want to thank you for all you've done for our great nation. May God bless you and your families. And may God continue to bless this great land of liberty, the United States ofAmerica.",bush
"Thank you, President Byker; members of the faculty; distinguished guests; parents, friends,family -- and, most importantly, the Class of 2005. Thanks for having me. I was excited to come back to Calvin, and I was just telling Laura the other night about what fun it would be to come to Calvin College. And I said, you know, ""Laura, I love being around so many young folks. You know, it gives me a chance to re-live my glory days in academia."" She said, ""George, that's not exactly how I would describe your college experience."" She also said one other thing I think the graduates will appreciate hearing, good piece of advice. She said, the folks here are here to get their diploma, not tohear from an old guy go on too long. So with that sage advice, here goes. I bring a great message of hope and freedom to Calvin College Class of 2005: There's life after Professor Vanden Bosch and English 101. Someday you will appreciate the grammar and verbal skills you learned here. And if any of you wonder how far a mastery of the Englishlanguage can take you, just look what it did for me. I thank the moms and dads here for your sacrifice and for your love. I want to thank the faculty for your hard work and dedication. And, again, I congratulate the Class of 2005. Soon -- soon you will collect your degrees and say goodbyes to a school that has been your home, and you will take your rightful place in a country that offers you the greatest freedom and opportunity on Earth. I ask that you use what you've learned here to make your owncontributions to the story of American freedom. The immigrants who founded Calvin College came to America for the freedom to worship, and they built this great school on the sturdy ground of liberty. They saw in the American ""experiment"" the world's best hope for freedom -- and they weren't the only ones excited about what they saw. In 1835, a young civil servant and aristocrat from France, named Alexisde Tocqueville, would publish a book about America that still resonates today. The book is called ""Democracy in America,"" and in it this young Frenchman said that the secret to America's success was our talent for bringing people together for the common good. De Tocqueville wrote that tyrants maintained their power by ""isolating"" their citizens -- and that Americans guaranteed their freedom by their remarkable ability to band together without any direction from government. The America he described offered the world something it had never seen before: a working model of a thriving democracy where opportunity was unbounded, where virtue was strong, and where citizens took responsibility for theirneighbors. Tocqueville's account is not just the observations of one man -- it is the story of our founding. It's not just a description of America at a point in time -- it is an agenda for our time. Our Founders rejected both a radical individualism that makes no room for others, and the dreary collectivism that crushes the individual. They gave us instead a society where individual freedom is anchored in communities. And in this hopeful new century, we have a great goal: to renew this spirit of community and thereby renew the character and compassion of ourcountry. First, we must understand that the character of our citizens is essential to society. In a free and compassionate society, the public good depends on private character. That character is formed and shaped in institutions like family, faith, and the many civil and -- social and civic organizations, from the Boy Scouts to the Rotary Clubs. The future success of our nation depends on our ability to understand the difference between right and wrong and to have the strength of character to make the right choices. Governmentcannot create character, but it can and should respect and support the institutions that do. Second, we must understand the importance of keeping power close to the people. Local people know local problems, they know the names and faces of their neighbors. The heart and soul of America is in our local communities; it is in the citizen school boards that determine how our children are educated; it's in city councils and state legislators that reflect the unique needs and priorities of the people they serve; it's in the volunteer groups that transform towns and cities into caring communities and neighborhoods. In the years to come, I hope that you'll consider joining these associations or serving in government -- because when you come together to serve a cause greater than yourself, you will energize your communities andyou will help build a more just and compassionate America. Finally, we must understand that it is by becoming active in our communities that we move beyond our narrow interests. In today's complex world, there are a lot of things that pull us apart. We need to support and encourage the institutions and pursuits that bring us together. And we learn how to come together by participating in our churches and temples and mosques and synagogues; in civil rights associations; in our PTAs and Jaycees; in our gardening and book clubs, interest groups and chambers of commerce; in our service groups -- from soupkitchens to homeless shelters. All these organizations promote the spirit of community and help us acquire the ""habits of heart"" that are so vital to a free society. And because one of the deepest values of our country is compassion, we must never turn away from any citizen who feels isolated from the opportunities of America. Our faith-based and community groups provide the armies of compassion that help people who wonder if the American Dream is meant for them. These armies of compassion are the great engines of social change. They serve individual and localneeds, and they have been found at the front of every great movement in American history. The history of forming associations dedicated to serving others is as old as America, itself. From abolition societies and suffrage movements to immigrant aid groups and prison reform ministries, America's social entrepreneurs have often been far ahead of our government in identifying and meeting the needs of our fellow countrymen. Because they are closer to the people they serve, our faith-based and community organizations deliver better results than government. And they have a human touch: When a person in need knocks on the door of a faith-based or community organization, he or she iswelcomed as a brother or a sister. No one understood this better than another 19th century visitor to America whose name is well known to Calvin College: Abraham Kuyper. Kuyper was a Dutchman who would be elected his nation's prime minister, and he knew all about the importance of associations because he founded so many of them -- including two newspapers, a political party, and a university. Kuyper contrasted the humanizing influence of independent social institutions with the ""mechanical character of government."" And in a famous speech right here in Grand Rapids, he urged Dutch immigrants to resist the temptation to retreat behind their own walls. He told them to go out into their adopted America and make a true difference as trueChristian citizens. Our government is encouraging all Americans to make a difference through our faith-based and community initiative; we're mobilizing Americans to volunteer through the USA Freedom Corps. We'll do our part, but, ultimately, service is up to you. It is your choice to make. As your generation takes its place in the world, all of you must make this decision: Will you be a spectator or a citizen? To make a difference in this world, you must be involved. By serving a higher calling here or abroad, you'll make your lives richer and build a more hopeful future forour world. At Calvin College, you take this call to service to heart. You serve as ""agents of renewal"" across the Earth. You volunteer for Big Brothers/Big Sisters to mentor young people. You work at Bethany Christian Services here in Grand Rapids, one of the best-known adoption services in America. A former Calvin student and professor, Vern Ehlers, serves in the halls of Congress. As the Class of 2005 goes out into the world, I ask you to embrace this tradition of service and help set an example for all Americans. As Americans we share an agenda that calls us to action -- a great responsibility to serve and love others, a responsibility that goesback to the greatest commandment. This isn't a Democrat idea. This isn't a Republican idea. This is an American idea. It has sustained our nation's liberty for more than 200 years. The Founders knew that too much government leads to oppression, but that too little government can leave us helpless and alone. So they built a free society with many roots in community. And to keep the tree ofliberty standing tall in the century before us, you must nourish those roots. Today, the Calvin Class of 2005 looks out on an America that continues to be defined by the promise of our Declaration of Independence. We're [still] the nation our Founders imagined, where individual freedom and opportunity is unbounded, where community is vibrant, where compassion keeps us from resting until all our citizens take their place at the banquet of freedom and equality. And with your help, we'll all do our part to transform our great land oneperson and one community at a time. Thank you for having me and may God bless you, and may God continue to bless our country.",bush
"Good evening. I'm speaking to you from the city of New Orleans -- nearly empty, still partly under water, and waiting for life and hope to return. Eastward from Lake Pontchartrain, acrossthe Mississippi coast, to Alabama into Florida, millions of lives were changed in a day by acruel and wasteful storm. In the aftermath, we have seen fellow citizens left stunned and uprooted, searching for lovedones, and grieving for the dead, and looking for meaning in a tragedy that seems so blind and random. We've also witnessed the kind of desperation no citizen of this great and generous nation should ever have to know -- fellow Americans calling out for food and water, vulnerablepeople left at the mercy of criminals who had no mercy, and the bodies of the dead lyinguncovered and untended in the street. These days of sorrow and outrage have also been marked by acts of courage and kindnessthat make all Americans proud. Coast Guard and other personnel rescued tens of thousands of people from flooded neighborhoods. Religious congregations and families have welcomedstrangers as brothers and sisters and neighbors. In the community of Chalmette, when two men tried to break into a home, the owner invitedthem to stay -- and took in 15 other people who had no place to go. At Tulane Hospital for Children, doctors and nurses did not eat for days so patients could have food, and eventuallycarried the patients on their backs up eight flights of stairs to helicopters. Many first responders were victims themselves, wounded healers, with a sense of duty greater than their own suffering. When I met Steve Scott of the Biloxi Fire Department, he and hiscolleagues were conducting a house-to-house search for survivors. Steve told me this, ""I lostmy house and I lost my cars, but I still got my family, and I still got my spirit."" Across the Gulf Coast, among people who have lost much, and suffered much, and given to the limit of their power, we are seeing that same spirit -- a core of strength that survives allhurt, a faith in God no storm can take away, and a powerful American determination to clearthe ruins and build better than before. Tonight so many victims of the hurricane and the flood are far from home and friends andfamiliar things. You need to know that our whole nation cares about you, and in the journey ahead you're not alone. To all who carry a burden of loss, I extend the deepest sympathy of our country. To every person who has served and sacrificed in this emergency, I offer thegratitude of our country. And tonight I also, also offer this pledge of the American people: Throughout the area hit by the hurricane, we will do what it takes, we will stay as long as ittakes, to help citizens rebuild their communities and their lives. And all who question the future of the Crescent City need to know there is no way to imagine America without NewOrleans, and this great city will rise again. The work of rescue is largely finished; the work of recovery is moving forward. In nearly all of Mississippi, electric power has been restored. Trade is starting to return to the Port of NewOrleans, and agricultural shipments are moving down the Mississippi River. All major gasoline pipelines are now in operation, preventing the supply disruptions that many feared. The breaks in the levees have been closed, the pumps are running, and the water here in NewOrleans is receding by the hour. Environmental officials are on the ground, taking water samples, identifying and dealing with hazardous debris, and working to get drinking water andwaste water treatment systems operating again. And some very sad duties are being carried out by professionals who gather the dead, treat them with respect, and prepare them for theirrest. In the task of recovery and rebuilding, some of the hardest work is still ahead, and it willrequire the creative skill and generosity of a united country. Our first commitment is to meet the immediate needs of those who had to flee their homesand leave all their possessions behind. For these Americans, every night brings uncertainty, every day requires new courage, and in the months to come will bring more than their fairshare of struggles. The Department of Homeland Security is registering evacuees who are now in shelters and churches, or private homes, whether in the Gulf region or far away. I have signed an orderproviding immediate assistance to people from the disaster area. As of today, more than 500,000 evacuee families have gotten emergency help to pay for food, clothing, and otheressentials. Evacuees who have not yet (registered? 5:38) registered should contact FEMA or the Red Cross. We need to know who you are, because many of you will be eligible for broader assistance in the future. Many families were separated during the evacuation, and weare working to help you reunite. Please call this number: 1-877-568-3317 -- that's 1-877- 568-3317 -- and we will work to bring your family back together, and pay for your travel toreach them. In addition, we're taking steps to ensure that evacuees do not have to travel great distances or navigate bureaucracies to get the benefits that are there for them. The Department ofHealth and Human Services has sent more than 1,500 health professionals, along with over 50 tons of medical supplies -- including vaccines and antibiotics and medicines for people withchronic conditions such as diabetes. The Social Security Administration is delivering checks. The Department of Labor is helping displaced persons apply for temporary jobs and unemployment benefits. And the Postal Service is registering new addresses so that peoplecan get their mail. To carry out the first stages of the relief effort and begin rebuilding at once, I have asked for, and the Congress has provided, more than $60 billion dollars. This is an unprecedentedresponse to an unprecedented crisis, which demonstrates the compassion and resolve of ournation. Our second commitment is to help the citizens of the Gulf Coast to overcome this disaster, put their lives back together, and rebuild their communities. Along this coast, for mile after mile,the wind and water swept the land clean. In Mississippi, many thousands of houses were damaged or destroyed. In New Orleans and surrounding parishes, more than a quarter-millionhouses are no longer safe to live in. Hundreds of thousands of people from across this regionwill need to find longer-term housing. Our goal is to get people out of the shelters by the middle of October. So we're providingdirect assistance to evacuees that allows them to rent apartments, and many already are moving into places of their own. A number of states have taken in evacuees and shown themgreat compassion -- admitting children to school, and providing health care. So I will workwith the Congress to ensure that states are reimbursed for these extra expenses. In the disaster area, and in cities that have received huge numbers of displaced people, we'rebeginning to bring in mobile homes and trailers for temporary use. To relieve the burden on local health care facilities in the region, we're sending extra doctors and nurses to theseareas. We're also providing money that can be used to cover overtime pay for police and firedepartments while the cities and towns rebuild. Near New Orleans, Biloxi, and other cities, housing is urgently needed for police and firefighters, other service providers, and the many workers who are going to rebuild thesecities. Right now, many are sleeping on ships we have brought to the Port of New Orleans -- and more ships are on their way to the region. And we'll provide mobile homes, and supplythem with basic services, as close to construction areas as possible, so the rebuilding processcan go forward as quickly as possible. And the federal government will undertake a close partnership with the states of Louisiana and Mississippi, the city of New Orleans, and other Gulf Coast cities, so they can rebuild in asensible, well-planned way. Federal funds will cover the great majority of the costs of repairing public infrastructure in the disaster zone, from roads and bridges to schools andwater systems. Our goal is to get the work done quickly. And taxpayers expect this work to be done honestly and wisely -- so we'll have a team of inspectors general reviewing allexpenditures. In the rebuilding process, there will be many important decisions and many details to resolve, yet we're moving forward according to some clear principles. The federal government will be fully engaged in the mission, but Governor Barbour, Governor Blanco, Mayor Nagin, and otherstate and local leaders will have the primary role in planning for their own future. Clearly, communities will need to move decisively to change zoning laws and building codes, in orderto avoid a repeat of what we've seen. And in the work of rebuilding, as many jobs as possibleshould go to the men and women who live in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Our third commitment is this: When communities are rebuilt, they must be even better andstronger than before the storm. Within the Gulf region are some of the most beautiful and historic places in America. As all ofus saw on television, there's also some deep, persistent poverty in this region as well. That poverty has roots in a history of racial discrimination, which cut off generations from theopportunity of America. We have a duty to confront this poverty with bold action. So let us restore all that we have cherished from yesterday, and let us rise above the legacy ofinequality. When the streets are rebuilt, there should be many new businesses, including minority-owned businesses, along those streets. When the houses are rebuilt, more familiesshould own, not rent, those houses. When the regional economy revives, local people shouldbe prepared for the jobs being created. Americans want the Gulf Coast not just to survive, but to thrive; not just to cope, but to overcome. We want evacuees to come home, for the best of reasons -- because they have areal chance at a better life in a place they love. When one resident of this city who lost his home was asked by a reporter if he would relocate, he said, ""Naw, I will rebuild -- but I will build higher."" That is our vision for the future, in thiscity and beyond. We'll not just rebuild, we'll build higher and better. To meet this goal, I will listen to good ideas from Congress, and state and local officials, and the private sector. Ibelieve we should start with three initiatives that the Congress should pass. Tonight I propose the creation of a Gulf Opportunity Zone, encompassing the region of thedisaster in Louisiana and Mississippi and Alabama. Within this zone, we should provide immediate incentives for job-creating investment, tax relief for small businesses, incentives tocompanies that create jobs, and loans and loan guarantees for small businesses, including minority-owned enterprises, to get them up and running again. It is entrepreneurship thatcreates jobs and opportunity; it is entrepreneurship that helps break the cycle of poverty; andwe will take the side of entrepreneurs as they lead the economic revival of the Gulf region. I propose the creation of Worker Recovery Accounts to help those evacuees who need extra help finding work. Under this plan, the federal government would provide accounts of up to$5,000, which these evacuees could draw upon for job training and education to help themget a good job, and for child care expenses during their job search. And to help lower-income citizens in the hurricane region build new and better lives, I alsopropose that Congress pass an Urban Homesteading Act. Under this approach, we will identify property in the region owned by the federal government, and provide building sites to low- income citizens free of charge, through a lottery. In return, they would pledge to build on the lot, with either a mortgage or help from a charitable organization like Habitat for Humanity. Home ownership is one of the great strengths of any community, and it must be a central partof our vision for the revival of this region. In the long run, the New Orleans area has a particular challenge, because much of the city lies below sea level. The people who call it home need to have reassurance that their lives will besafer in the years to come. Protecting a city that sits lower than the water around it is not easy, but it can, and has been done. City and parish officials in New Orleans, and stateofficials in Louisiana will have a large part in the engineering decisions to come. And the Army Corps of Engineers will work at their side to make the flood protection system stronger than ithas ever been. The work that has begun in the Gulf Coast region will be one of the largest reconstructionefforts the world has ever seen. When that job is done, all Americans will have something to be very proud of -- and all Americans are needed in this common effort. It is the armies ofcompassion -- charities and houses of worship, and idealistic men and women -- that give our reconstruction effort its humanity. They offer to those who hurt a friendly face, an arm aroundthe shoulder, and the reassurance that in hard times, they can count on someone who cares. By land, by sea, and by air, good people wanting to make a difference deployed to the GulfCoast, and they've been working around the clock ever since. The cash needed to support the armies of compassion is great, and Americans have givengenerously. For example, the private fundraising effort led by former Presidents Bush and Clinton has already received pledges of more than $100 million dollars. Some of that money isgoing to the Governors to be used for immediate needs within their states. A portion will also be sent to local houses of worship to help reimburse them for the expense of helping others.This evening the need is still urgent, and I ask the American people to continue donating to the Salvation Army, the Red Cross, other good charities, and religious congregations in theregion. It's also essential for the many organizations of our country to reach out to your fellowcitizens in the Gulf area. So I've asked USA Freedom Corps to create an information clearinghouse, available at usafreedomcorps.gov, so that families anywhere in the country canfind opportunities to help families in the region, or a school can support a school. And I challenge existing organizations -- churches, and Scout troops, or labor union locals to get intouch with their counterparts in Mississippi, Louisiana, or Alabama, and learn what they can do to help. In this great national enterprise, important work can be done by everyone, andeveryone should find their role and do their part. The government of this nation will do its part, as well. Our cities must have clear and up-to- date plans for responding to natural disasters, and disease outbreaks, or a terrorist attack, for evacuating large numbers of people in an emergency, and for providing the food and waterand security they would need. In a time of terror threats and weapons of mass destruction, the danger to our citizens reaches much wider than a fault line or a flood plain. I considerdetailed emergency planning to be a national security priority, and therefore, I've ordered the Department of Homeland Security to undertake an immediate review, in cooperation with localcounterparts, of emergency plans in every major city in America. I also want to know all the facts about the government response to Hurricane Katrina. The storm involved a massive flood, a major supply and security operation, and an evacuation order affecting more than a million people. It was not a normal hurricane -- and the normaldisaster relief system was not equal to it. Many of the men and women of the Coast Guard, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the United States military, the National Guard,Homeland Security, and state and local governments performed skillfully under the worst conditions. Yet the system, at every level of government, was not well-coordinated, and wasoverwhelmed in the first few days. It is now clear that a challenge on this scale requires greater federal authority and a broader role for the armed forces -- the institution of ourgovernment most capable of massive logistical operations on a moment's notice. Four years after the frightening experience of September the 11th, Americans have every right to expect a more effective response in a time of emergency. When the federal government fails to meet such an obligation, I, as President, am responsible for the problem,and for the solution. So I've ordered every Cabinet Secretary to participate in a comprehensive review of the government response to the hurricane. This government willlearn the lessons of Hurricane Katrina. We're going to review every action and make necessary changes, so that we are better prepared for any challenge of nature, or act of evilmen, that could threaten our people. The United States Congress also has an important oversight function to perform. Congress is preparing an investigation, and I will work with members of both parties to make sure thiseffort is thorough. In the life of this nation, we have often been reminded that nature is an awesome force, andthat all life is fragile. We're the heirs of men and women who lived through those first terrible winters at Jamestown and Plymouth, who rebuilt Chicago after a great fire, and San Franciscoafter a great earthquake, who reclaimed the prairie from the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. Every time, the people of this land have come back from fire, flood, and storm to build anew - - and to build better than what we had before. Americans have never left our destiny to thewhims of nature -- and we will not start now. These trials have also reminded us that we are often stronger than we know -- with the helpof grace and one another. They remind us of a hope beyond all pain and death, a God who welcomes the lost to a house not made with hands. And they remind us that we're tiedtogether in this life, in this nation -- and that the despair of any touches us all. I know that when you sit on the steps of a porch where a home once stood, or sleep on a cotin a crowded shelter, it is hard to imagine a bright future. But that future will come. The streets of Biloxi and Gulfport will again be filled with lovely homes and the sound of childrenplaying. The churches of Alabama will have their broken steeples mended and their congregations whole. And here in New Orleans, the street cars will once again rumble downSt. Charles, and the passionate soul of a great city will return. In this place, there's a custom for the funerals of jazz musicians. The funeral procession parades slowly through the streets, followed by a band playing a mournful dirge as it moves to the cemetery. Once the casket has been laid in place, the band breaks into a joyful ""secondline"" -- symbolizing the triumph of the spirit over death. Tonight the Gulf Coast is still comingthrough the dirge -- yet we will live to see the second line. Thank you, and may God bless America.",bush
"Nellie, thank you very much. I appreciate the invitation to speak. I'm calling from Manhattan, Kansas. Sounds like you got some good folks from Kansas there. I want to thank everybody there -- if you're from Kansas, or anywhere else in our country, for your devotion to such anoble cause. You believe, as I do, that every human life has value, that the strong have a duty to protect the weak, and that the self-evident truths of the Declaration of Independence apply to everyone, not just to those considered healthy or wanted or convenient. These principles call us to defend the sick and the dying, persons with disabilities and birth defects, all who areweak and vulnerable, especially unborn children. We're making good progress in defending these principles, Nellie, and you and I are working together, along with others, to build what I've called a ""culture of life."" One of my first acts as the President was to ban the use of taxpayer money on programs that promote abortion overseas. I want to thank you all for getting that ban on partial-birth abortion to my desk, a bill I was proud to sign -- and a law which we are going to defend -- and are defending -- vigorously in our courts. Because we acted, infants who are born despite an attempted abortion are now protected by law. Thanks to ""Laci and Conner's Law,"" prosecutors can now charge those whoharm or kill a pregnant woman with harming or killing her unborn child, as well. We're vigorously promoting parental notification laws, adoption, teen abstinence, crisis pregnancy programs, and the vital work of our faith-based groups. We're sending a clear message to any woman facing a crisis pregnancy: We love you; we love your child, and we'rehere to help you. There's more work to be done. The House has passed a bill to ensure that state parental involvement laws are not circumvented by those who take minors across state lines to haveabortion[s]. And the United States Senate needs to pass this bill so I can sign it into law. We also must respect human life and dignity when advancing medical science, and we're making progress here, as well. Last month, I signed a pro-life bill supporting ethical treatment and research using stem cells from umbilical cord blood. I also renew my call for Congress to ban all forms of human cloning. Because human life is a gift from our Creator and shouldnever be used as a means to an end, we will not sanction the creation of life only to destroy it. By changing laws we can change our culture. And your persistence and prayers, Nellie, and the folks there with you, are making a real difference. We, of course, seek common ground where possible; we're working to persuade more of our fellow Americans of the rightness of our cause. And this is a cause that appeals to the conscience of our citizens, and is rooted inAmerica's deepest principles -- and history tells us that with such a cause, we will prevail. Again, Nellie, thank you for letting me come to speak to you. Tell everybody there that I ask for God's blessings on them and their families, and, of course, may God continue to bless ourgrand country.",bush
"and diplomatic corps, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens, today our nation lost a beloved, graceful, courageous woman who called America to its founding ideals and carried on a noble dream. Tonight we are comforted by the hope of a glad reunion with the husband whowas taken so long ago, and we are grateful for the good life of Coretta Scott King. Every time I'm invited to this rostrum, I am humbled by the privilege and mindful of the history we have seen together. We have gathered under this Capitol dome in moments of national mourning and national achievement. We have served America through one of themost consequential periods of our history. And it has been my honor to serve with you. In a system of two parties, two chambers and two elected branches, there will always be differences and debate. But even tough debates can be conducted in a civil tone. And our differences cannot be allowed to harden into anger. To confront the great issues before us, we must act in a spirit of good will and respect for one another. And I will do my part. And I willdo my part. Tonight the state of our Union is strong, and together we will make it stronger. In this decisive year, you and I will make choices that determine both the future and the character of our country. We will choose to act confidently in pursuing the enemies of freedom or retreat from our duties in the hope of an easier life. We will choose to build our prosperity by leading theworld economy or shut ourselves off from trade and opportunity. In a complex and challenging time, the road of isolationism and protectionism may seem broad and inviting, yet it ends in danger and decline. The only way to protect our people, the only way to secure the peace, the only way to control our destiny is by our leadership. So theUnited States of America will continue to lead. Abroad, our nation is committed to an historic, long-term goal: We seek the end of tyranny in our world. Some dismiss that goal as misguided idealism. In reality, the future security of America depends on it. On September the 11th, 2001, we found that problems originating in a failed and oppressive state 7,000 miles away could bring murder and destruction to our country. Dictatorships shelter terrorists, and feed resentment and radicalism, and seek weapons of mass destruction. Democracies replace resentment with hope, respect the rights of their citizens and their neighbors, and join the fight against terror. Every step towardfreedom in the world makes our country safer, and so we will act boldly in freedom's cause. Far from being a hopeless dream, the advance of freedom is the great story of our time. In 1945, there were about two dozen lonely democracies in the world. Today there are 122. And we are writing a new chapter in the story of self-government, with women lining up to vote in Afghanistan, and millions of Iraqis marking their liberty with purple ink, and men and womenfrom Lebanon to Egypt debating the rights of individuals and the necessity of freedom. At the start of 2006, more than half the people of our world live in democratic nations. And we do not forget the other half -- in places like Syria and Burma, Zimbabwe, North Korea and Iran -- because the demands of justice and the peace of this world require their freedom aswell. No one can deny the success of freedom, but some men rage and fight against it. And one of the main sources of reaction and opposition is radical Islam; the perversion by a few of a noble faith into an ideology of terror and death. Terrorists like bin Laden are serious about mass murder and all of us must take their declared intentions seriously. They seek to impose a heartless system of totalitarian control throughoutthe Middle East and arm themselves with weapons of mass murder. Their aim is to seize power in Iraq and use it as a safe haven to launch attacks against America and the world. Lacking the military strength to challenge us directly, the terrorists have chosen the weapon of fear. When they murder children at a school in Beslan or blow up commuters in London or behead a bound captive, the terrorists hope these horrors will break our will, allowing the violent to inherit the Earth. But they have miscalculated. We love ourfreedom, and we will fight to keep it. In a time of testing, we cannot find security by abandoning our commitments and retreating within our borders. If we were to leave these vicious attackers alone, they would not leave us alone. They would simply move the battlefield to our own shores. There is no peace in retreat. And there is no honor in retreat. By allowing radical Islam to work its will, by leaving an assaulted world to fend for itself, we would signal to all that we no longer believe in our ownideals or even in our own courage. But our enemies and our friends can be certain: The United States will not retreat from the world, and we will never surrender to evil. America rejects the false comfort of isolationism. We are the nation that saved liberty in Europe, and liberated death camps, and helped raiseup democracies and faced down an evil empire. Once again, we accept the call of history to deliver the oppressed and move this world toward peace. We remain on the offensive against terror networks. We have killed or captured many of their leaders. And, for the others, their day will come. We remain on the offensive in Afghanistan, where a fine president and a national assembly are fighting terror while buildingthe institutions of a new democracy. We're on the offensive in Iraq, with a clear plan for victory. First, we are helping Iraqis build an inclusive government, so that old resentments will be eased and the insurgency will be marginalized. Second, we are continuing reconstruction efforts and helping the Iraqi government to fight corruption and build a modern economy, so all Iraqis can experience the benefits of freedom. Third, we are striking terrorist targets while we train Iraqi forces that are increasingly capable of defeating the enemy. Iraqis are showing their courage every day, and we are proud to betheir allies in the cause of freedom. Our work in Iraq is difficult, because our enemy is brutal. But that brutality has not stopped the dramatic progress of a new democracy. In less than three years, the nation has gone from dictatorship, to liberation, to sovereignty, to a constitution, to national elections. At the same time, our coalition has been relentless in shutting off terrorist infiltration, clearing out insurgent strongholds and turning over territory to Iraqi security forces. I am confident in our plan for victory. I am confident in the will of the Iraqi people. I am confident in the skill andspirit of our military. Fellow citizens, we are in this fight to win, and we are winning. The road of victory is the road that will take our troops home. As we make progress on the ground and Iraqi forces increasingly take the lead, we should be able to further decrease our troop levels. But those decisions will be made by our military commanders, not by politicians in Washington, D.C. Our coalition has learned from our experience in Iraq. We have adjusted our military tactics and changed our approach to reconstruction. Along the way, we have benefited from responsiblecriticism and counsel offered by members of Congress of both parties. In the coming year, I will continue to reach out and seek your good advice. Yet there is a difference between responsible criticism that aims for success and defeatism that refuses to acknowledge anything but failure. Hindsight alone is not wisdom. And second-guessing is not a strategy. With so much in the balance, those of us in public office have a duty to speak with candor. A sudden withdrawal of our forces from Iraq would abandon our Iraqi allies to death and prison, would put men like bin Laden and Zarqawi in charge of a strategic country andshow that a pledge from America means little. Members of Congress, however we feel about the decisions and debates of the past, our nation has only one option: We must keep our word, defeat our enemies and stand behind the American military in its vital mission. Our men and women in uniform are making sacrifices and showing a sense of duty stronger than all fear. They know what it's like to fight house to house in a maze of streets, to wear heavy gear in the desert heat, to see a comrade killed bya roadside bomb. And those who know the costs also know the stakes. Marine Staff Sergeant Dan Clay was killed last month fighting in Fabiani. He left behind a letter to his family, but his words could just as well be addressed to every American. Here is what Dan wrote: ""I know what honor is. It has been an honor to protect and serve all of you. I faced death with the secure knowledge that you would not have to. ""Never falter. Don't hesitate to honor and support those of us who had the honor of protecting that which is worth protecting."" Staff Sergeant Dan Clay's wife,Lisa, and his mom and dad, Sara Jo and Bud, are with us this evening. Welcome. Our nation is grateful to the fallen who live in the memory of our country. We are grateful to all who volunteer to wear our nation's uniform. And, as we honor our brave troops, let usnever forget the sacrifices of America's military families. Our offensive against terror involves more than military action. Ultimately, the only way to defeat the terrorists is to defeat their dark vision of hatred and fear by offering the hopeful alternative of political freedom and peaceful change. So the United States of America supports democratic reform across the broader Middle East. Elections are vital, but they are only thebeginning. Raising up a democracy requires the rule of law, and protection of minorities, and strong, accountable institutions that last longer than a single vote. The great people of Egypt have voted in a multiparty presidential election, and now their government should open paths of peaceful opposition that will reduce the appeal of radicalism. The Palestinian people have voted in elections. And now the leaders of Hamas must recognize Israel, disarm, reject terrorism and work for lasting peace. Saudi Arabia has taken the first steps of reform. Now itcan offer its people a better future by pressing forward with those efforts. Democracies in the Middle East will not look like our own, because they will reflect the traditions of their own citizens. Yet liberty is the future of every nation in the Middle East, because liberty is the right and hope of all humanity. The same is true of Iran, a nation now held hostage by a small clerical elite that is isolating and repressing its people. The regime in that country sponsors terrorists in the Palestinian territories and in Lebanon, and that must come to an end. The Iranian government is defying the world with its nuclear ambitions, and the nations of the world must not permit the Iranian regime to gain nuclear weapons. Americawill continue to rally the world to confront these threats. And, tonight, let me speak directly to the citizens of Iran: America respects you and we respect your country. We respect your right to choose your own future and win your own freedom. And our nation hopes one day to be the closest of friends with a free and democraticIran. To overcome dangers in our world, we must also take the offensive by encouraging economic progress and fighting disease and spreading hope in hopeless lands. Isolationism would not only tie our hands in fighting enemies; it would keep us from helping our friends in desperateneed. We show compassion abroad because Americans believe in the God- given dignity and worth of a villager with HIV/AIDS, or an infant with malaria, or a refugee fleeing genocide, or a young girl sold into slavery. We also show compassion abroad because regions overwhelmed by poverty, corruption and despair are sources of terrorism and organized crime and human trafficking and the drug trade. In recent years, you and I have taken unprecedented action to fight AIDS and malaria, expand the education of girls, and reward developing nations that are moving forward with economic and political reform. For people everywhere, the United States is a partner for a better life. Short-changing these efforts would increase the suffering andchaos of our world, undercut our long-term security and dull the conscience of our country. I urge members of Congress to serve the interests of America by showing the compassion of America. Our country must also remain on the offensive against terrorism here at home. The enemy has not lost the desire or capability to attack us. Fortunately, this nation has superb professionals in law enforcement, intelligence, the military and homeland security. These men and women are dedicating their lives to protecting us all, and they deserve our support and our thanks. They also deserve the same tools they already use to fight drug trafficking andorganized crime -- so I ask you to reauthorize the Patriot Act. It is said that prior to the attacks of September the 11th, our government failed to connect the dots of the conspiracy. We now know that two of the hijackers in the United States placed telephone calls to Al Qaida operatives overseas. But we did not know about their plans until itwas too late. So to prevent another attack -- based on authority given to me by the Constitution and by statute -- I have authorized a terrorist surveillance program to aggressively pursue the international communications of suspected Al Qaida operatives and affiliates to and from America. Previous presidents have used the same constitutional authority I have and federal courts have approved the use of that authority. Appropriate members of Congress have beenkept informed. The terrorist surveillance program has helped prevent terrorist attacks. It remains essential to the security of America. If there are people inside our country who are talking with Al Qaida, we want to know about it, because we will not sit back and wait to be hit again. In all these areas -- from the disruption of terror networks, to victory in Iraq, to the spread of freedomand hope in troubled regions -- we need the support of our friends and allies. To draw that support, we must always be clear in our principles and willing to act. The only alternative to American leadership is a dramatically more dangerous and anxious world. Yet we also choose to lead because it is a privilege to serve the values that gave us birth. American leaders -- from Roosevelt, to Truman, to Kennedy, to Reagan -- rejected isolation and retreat because they knew that America is always more secure when freedom is on themarch. Our own generation is in a long war against a determined enemy, a war that will be fought by presidents of both parties who will need steady bipartisan support from the Congress. And tonight I ask for yours. Together, let us protect our country, support the men and women whodefend us, and lead this world toward freedom. Here at home, America also has a great opportunity: We will build the prosperity of our country by strengthening our economic leadership in the world. Our economy is healthy and vigorous, and growing faster than other major industrialized nations. In the last two-and-a- half years, America has created 4.6 million new jobs -- more than Japan and the European Union combined. Even in the face of higher energy prices and natural disasters, the American people have turned in an economic performance that is the envy of the world. The American economy is preeminent, but we cannot afford to be complacent. In a dynamic world economy, we are seeing new competitors like China and India. And this creates uncertainty, whichmakes it easier to feed people's fears. So we're seeing some old temptations return. Protectionists want to escape competition, pretending that we can keep our high standard of living while walling off our economy. Others say that the government needs to take a larger role in directing the economy, centralizing more power in Washington and increasing taxes. We hear claims that immigrants are somehow bad for the economy, even though this economy could not function without them. All these are forms of economic retreat, and they lead in the same direction: toward astagnant and second-rate economy. Tonight I will set out a better path: an agenda for a nation that competes with confidence, an agenda that will raise standards of living and generate new jobs. Americans should not fear our economic future, because we intend to shape it. Keeping America competitive begins with keeping our economy growing. And our economy grows when Americans have more of theirown money to spend, save and invest. In the last five years, the tax relief you passed has left $880 billion in the hands of American workers, investors, small businesses and families. And they have used it to help produce more than four years of uninterrupted economic growth. Yet the tax relief is set to expire in the next few years. If we do nothing, American families will face a massive tax increase they do not expect and will not welcome. Because America needs more than a temporary expansion, we need more than temporary tax relief. I urge the Congress to act responsibly and make thetax cuts permanent. Keeping America competitive requires us to be good stewards of tax dollars. Every year of my presidency, we've reduced the growth of nonsecurity discretionary spending. And last year you passed bills that cut this spending. This year my budget will cut it again and reduce or eliminate more than 140 programs that are performing poorly or not fulfilling essential priorities. By passing these reforms, we will save the American taxpayer another $14 billionnext year and stay on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009. I am pleased that the members of Congress are working on earmark reform, because the federal budget has too many special interest projects. And we can tackle this problemtogether, if you pass the line-item veto. We must also confront the larger challenge of mandatory spending, or entitlements. This year, the first of about 78 million baby boomers turns 60, including two of my dad's favorite people: me and President Clinton. This milestone is more than a personal crisis. It is a nationalchallenge. The retirement of the baby boom generation will put unprecedented strains on the federal government. By 2030, spending for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid alone will be almost 60 percent of the entire federal budget. And that will present future Congresses with impossible choices: staggering tax increases, immense deficits or deep cuts in every category of spending. Congress did not act last year on my proposal to save Social Security, yet the rising cost of entitlements is a problem that is not going away. And with every year we fail toact, the situation gets worse. So tonight I ask you to join me in creating a commission to examine the full impact of baby boom retirements on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. This commission should include members of Congress of both parties and offer bipartisan solutions. We need to put asidepartisan politics and work together and get this problem solved. Keeping America competitive requires us to open more markets for all that Americans make and grow. One out of every five factory jobs in America is related to global trade, and we want people everywhere to buy American. With open markets and a level playing field, no one canout- produce or out-compete the American worker. Keeping America competitive requires an immigration system that upholds our laws, reflects our values and serves the interests of our economy. Our nation needs orderly and secure borders. To meet this goal, we must have stronger immigration enforcement and border protection. And we must have a rational, humane guest worker program that rejects amnesty, allows temporary jobs for people who seek them legally, and reduces smuggling and crime atthe border. Keeping America competitive requires affordable health care. Our government has a responsibility to help provide health care for the poor and the elderly, and we are meeting that responsibility. For all Americans -- for all Americans -- we must confront the rising cost of care, strengthen the doctor-patient relationship, and help people afford the insurance coverage they need. We will make wider use of electronic records and other health information technology to help control costs and reduce dangerous medical errors. We will strengthen health savings accounts, making sure individuals and small-business employees can buy insurance with the same advantages that people working for big businesses now get. We will do more to make this coverage portable, so workers can switch jobs without having to worry about losing their health insurance. And because lawsuits are driving many good doctors out of practice -- leaving women in nearly 1,500 American counties without a single OB/GYN -- I ask theCongress to pass medical liability reform this year. Keeping America competitive requires affordable energy. And here we have a serious problem: America is addicted to oil, which is often imported from unstable parts of the world. The best way to break this addiction is through technology. Since 2001, we have spent nearly $10 billion to develop cleaner, cheaper and more reliable alternative energy sources. And weare on the threshold of incredible advances. So tonight I announce the Advanced Energy Initiative -- a 22 percent increase in clean-energy research at the Department of Energy to push for breakthroughs in two vital areas. To change how we power our homes and offices, we will invest more in zero-emission coal-fired plants; revolutionary solar and wind technologies; and clean, safe nuclear energy. We must also change how we power our automobiles. We will increase our research in better batteries forhybrid and electric cars and in pollution-free cars that run on hydrogen. We will also fund additional research in cutting-edge methods of producing ethanol, not just from corn but from wood chips and stalks or switch grass. Our goal is to make this new kind of ethanol practical and competitive within six years. Breakthroughs on this and other new technologies will help us reach another great goal: to replace more than 75 percent of our oil imports from the Middle East by 2025. By applying -- By applying the talent and technology of America, this country can dramatically improve our environment, move beyond a petroleum-based economy and make our dependence on Middle Eastern oil a thing of the past. And to keep America competitive, one commitment is necessary above all: We must continue to lead the world in human talent and creativity. Our greatest advantage in the world has always been our educated, hardworking, ambitious people, and we are going to keep that edge. Tonight I announce the American Competitiveness Initiative to encourage innovation throughout our economy and to give our nation's children a firm grounding in math andscience. First, I propose to double the federal commitment to the most critical basic research programs in the physical sciences over the next 10 years. This funding will support the work of America's most creative minds as they explore promising areas such as nanotechnology,supercomputing and alternative energy sources. Second, I propose to make permanent the research and development tax credit, to encourage bolder private-sector initiatives in technology. With more research in both the public and private sectors, we will improve our quality of life and ensure that America will lead the worldin opportunity and innovation for decades to come. Third, we need to encourage children to take more math and science, and to make sure those courses are rigorous enough to compete with other nations. We made a good start in the early grades with the No Child Left Behind Act, which is raising standards and lifting test scoresacross our country. Tonight I propose to train 70,000 high school teachers to lead advanced placement courses in math and science, bring 30,000 math and science professionals to teach in classrooms, and give early help to students who struggle with math so they have a better chance at good, high-wage jobs. If we ensure that America's children succeed in life, they will ensure that America succeeds in the world. Preparing our nation to compete in the world is a goal that all of us can share. I urge you to support the American Competitiveness Initiative and, together,we will show the world what the American people can achieve. America is a great force for freedom and prosperity. Yet our greatness is not measured in power or luxuries, but by who we are and how we treat one another. So we strive to be a compassionate, decent, hopeful society. In recent years, America has become a more hopeful nation. Violent crime rates have fallen to their lowest levels since the 1970s. Welfare cases have dropped by more than half over the past decade. Drug use among youth is down 19 percent since 2001. There are fewer abortions in America than at any point in the last three decades. And the number of children born to teenage mothers has been falling for a dozen years in a row. These gains are evidence of a quiet transformation, a revolution of conscience in which arising generation is finding that a life of personal responsibility is a life of fulfillment. Government has played a role. Wise policies such as welfare reform, and drug education, and support for abstinence and adoption have made a difference in the character of our country.And everyone here tonight, Democrat and Republican, has a right to be proud of this record. Yet many Americans, especially parents, still have deep concerns about the direction of our culture and the health of our most basic institutions. They are concerned about unethical conduct by public officials and discouraged by activist courts that try to redefine marriage. They worry about children in our society who need direction and love, and about fellow citizens still displaced by natural disaster, and about suffering caused by treatable diseases. As we look at these challenges, we must never give in to the belief that America is in decline or that our culture is doomed to unravel. The American people know better than that. Wehave proven the pessimists wrong before, and we will do it again. A hopeful society depends on courts that deliver equal justice under law. The Supreme Court now has two superb new members -- new members on its bench: Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Sam Alito. I thank the Senate for confirming both of them. I will continue to nominate men and women who understand that judges must be servants of the law and notlegislate from the bench. Today marks the official retirement of a very special American. For 24 years of faithful serviceto our nation, the United States is grateful to Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. A hopeful society has institutions of science and medicine that do not cut ethical corners and that recognize the matchless value of every life. Tonight I ask you to pass legislation to prohibit the most egregious abuses of medical research: human cloning in all its forms; creating or implanting embryos for experiments; creating human-animal hybrids; and buying, selling or patenting human embryos. Human life is a gift from our creator, and that gift shouldnever be discarded, devalued or put up for sale. A hopeful society expects elected officials to uphold the public trust. Honorable people in both parties are working on reforms to strengthen the ethical standards of Washington. I support your efforts. Each of us has made a pledge to be worthy of public responsibility, and that is apledge we must never forget, never dismiss and never betray. As we renew the promise of our institutions, let us also show the character of America in our compassion and care for one another. As we renew the promise of our institutions, let us alsoshow the character of America in our compassion and care for one another. A hopeful society gives special attention to children who lack direction and love. Through the Helping America's Youth Initiative, we are encouraging caring adults to get involved in the life of a child. And this good work is led by our first lady, Laura Bush. This year we will add resources to encourage young people to stay in school so more of America's youth can raisetheir sights and achieve their dreams. A hopeful society comes to the aid of fellow citizens in times of suffering and emergency and stays at it until they're back on their feet. So far, the federal government has committed $85 billion to the people of the Gulf Coast and New Orleans. We are removing debris and repairing highways and rebuilding stronger levees. We're providing business loans and housingassistance. Yet, as we meet these immediate needs, we must also address deeper challenges that existed before the storm arrived. In New Orleans and in other places, many of our fellow citizens have felt excluded from the promise of our country. The answer is not only temporary relief, but schools that teach every child, and job skills that bring upward mobility, and more opportunities to own a home and start a business. As we recover from a disaster, let us also work for the day when all Americans are protected by justice; equal in hope and rich inopportunity. A hopeful society acts boldly to fight diseases like HIV/AIDS, which can be prevented and treated and defeated. More than a million Americans live with HIV, and half of all AIDS cases occur among African-Americans. I ask Congress to reform and reauthorize the Ryan White Act and provide new funding to states so we end the waiting lists for AIDS medicines in America. We will also lead a nationwide effort, working closely with African-American churches and faith-based groups, to deliver rapid HIV tests to millions, end the stigma of AIDS and comecloser to the day when there are no new infections in America. Fellow citizens, we have been called to leadership in a period of consequence. We have entered a great ideological conflict we did nothing to invite. We see great changes in science and commerce that will influence all our lives. Sometimes it can seem that history is turning in a wide arc, toward an unknown shore. Yet the destination of history is determined by humanaction, and every great movement of history comes to a point of choosing. Lincoln could have accepted peace at the cost of disunity and continued slavery. Martin Luther King could have stopped at Birmingham or at Selma and achieved only half a victory over segregation. The United States could have accepted the permanent division of Europe andbeen complicit in the oppression of others. Today, having come far in our own historical journey, we must decide: Will we turn back or finish well? Before history is written down in books, it is written in courage. Like Americans before us, we will show that courage and we will finish well. We will lead freedom's advance. We will compete and excel in the global economy. We will renew the defining moral commitments of this land. And so we move forward optimistic about our country, faithful to itscause and confident of the victories to come. May God bless America.",bush
"The issue of immigration stirs intense emotions, and in recent weeks, Americans have seen those emotions on display. On the streets of major cities, crowds have rallied in support of those in our country illegally. At our southern border, others have organized to stop illegal immigrants from coming in. Across the country, Americans are trying to reconcile these contrasting images. And in Washington, the debate over immigration reform has reached a time of decision. Tonight, I will make it clear where I stand, and where I want to lead ourcountry on this vital issue. We must begin by recognizing the problems with our immigration system. For decades, the United States has not been in complete control of its borders. As a result, many who want towork in our economy have been able to sneak across our border, and millions have stayed. Once here, illegal immigrants live in the shadows of our society. Many use forged documents to get jobs, and that makes it difficult for employers to verify that the workers they hire are legal. Illegal immigration puts pressure on public schools and hospitals, it strains state and local budgets, and brings crime to our communities. These are real problems. Yet we must remember that the vast majority of illegal immigrants are decent people who work hard, support their families, practice their faith, and lead responsible lives. They are a part ofAmerican life, but they are beyond the reach and protection of American law. We're a nation of laws, and we must enforce our laws. We're also a nation of immigrants, and we must uphold that tradition, which has strengthened our country in so many ways. These are not contradictory goals. America can be a lawful society and a welcoming society at the same time. We will fix the problems created by illegal immigration, and we will deliver a system that is secure, orderly, and fair. So I support comprehensive immigration reform thatwill accomplish five clear objectives. First, the United States must secure its borders. This is a basic responsibility of a sovereign nation. It is also an urgent requirement of our national security. Our objective is straightforward: The border should be open to trade and lawful immigration, and shut toillegal immigrants, as well as criminals, drug dealers, and terrorists. I was a governor of a state that has a 1,200-mile border with Mexico. So I know how difficult it is to enforce the border, and how important it is. Since I became President, we've increased funding for border security by 66 percent, and expanded the Border Patrol from about 9,000 to 12,000 agents. The men and women of our Border Patrol are doing a fine job in difficult circumstances, and over the past five years, they have apprehended and sent home about sixmillion people entering America illegally. Despite this progress, we do not yet have full control of the border, and I am determined to change that. Tonight I'm calling on Congress to provide funding for dramatic improvements in manpower and technology at the border. By the end of 2008, we'll increase the number of Border Patrol officers by an additional 6,000. When these new agents are deployed, we'll havemore than doubled the size of the Border Patrol during my presidency. At the same time, we're launching the most technologically advanced border security initiative in American history. We will construct high-tech fences in urban corridors, and build new patrol roads and barriers in rural areas. We'll employ motion sensors, infrared cameras, and unmanned aerial vehicles to prevent illegal crossings. America has the best technology in the world, and we will ensure that the Border Patrol has the technology they need to do their joband secure our border. Training thousands of new Border Patrol agents and bringing the most advanced technology to the border will take time. Yet the need to secure our border is urgent. So I'm announcingseveral immediate steps to strengthen border enforcement during this period of transition: One way to help during this transition is to use the National Guard. So, in coordination with governors, up to 6,000 Guard members will be deployed to our southern border. The Border Patrol will remain in the lead. The Guard will assist the Border Patrol by operating surveillance systems, analyzing intelligence, installing fences and vehicle barriers, building patrol roads, and providing training. Guard units will not be involved in direct law enforcement activities -- that duty will be done by the Border Patrol. This initial commitment of Guard members would last for a period of one year. After that, the number of Guard forces will be reduced as new Border Patrol agents and new technologies come online. It is important for Americans to know that we have enough Guard forces to win the war on terror, to respond to natural disasters,and to help secure our border. The United States is not going to militarize the southern border. Mexico is our neighbor, and our friend. We will continue to work cooperatively to improve security on both sides of the border, to confront common problems like drug trafficking and crime, and to reduce illegalimmigration. Another way to help during this period of transition is through state and local law enforcement in our border communities. So we'll increase federal funding for state and local authorities assisting the Border Patrol on targeted enforcement missions. We will give state and local authorities the specialized training they need to help federal officers apprehend and detain illegal immigrants. State and local law enforcement officials are an important part of ourborder security and they need to be a part of our strategy to secure our borders. The steps I've outlined will improve our ability to catch people entering our country illegally. At the same time, we must ensure that every illegal immigrant we catch crossing our southern border is returned home. More than 85 percent of the illegal immigrants we catch crossing the southern border are Mexicans, and most are sent back home within 24 hours. But when we catch illegal immigrants from other country [sic] it is not as easy to send them home. For many years, the government did not have enough space in our detention facilities to hold them while the legal process unfolded. So most were released back into our society and asked to return for a court date. When the date arrived, the vast majority did not show up. Thispractice, called ""catch and release,"" is unacceptable, and we will end it. We're taking several important steps to meet this goal. We've expanded the number of beds in our detention facilities, and we will continue to add more. We've expedited the legal process to cut the average deportation time. And we're making it clear to foreign governments that they must accept back their citizens who violate our immigration laws. As a result of these actions, we've ended ""catch and release"" for illegal immigrants from some countries. And I will ask Congress for additional funding and legal authority, so we can end ""catch and release"" at the southern border once and for all. When people know that they'll be caught and sent homeif they enter our country illegally, they will be less likely to try to sneak in. Second, to secure our border, we must create a temporary worker program. The reality is that there are many people on the other side of our border who will do anything to come to America to work and build a better life. They walk across miles of desert in the summer heat, or hide in the back of 18-wheelers to reach our country. This creates enormous pressure on our border that walls and patrols alone will not stop. To secure the border effectively, we mustreduce the numbers of people trying to sneak across. Therefore, I support a temporary worker program that would create a legal path for foreign workers to enter our country in an orderly way, for a limited period of time. This program would match willing foreign workers with willing American employers for jobs Americans are not doing. Every worker who applies for the program would be required to pass criminal background checks. And temporary workers must return to their home country at theconclusion of their stay. A temporary worker program would meet the needs of our economy, and it would give honest immigrants a way to provide for their families while respecting the law. A temporary worker program would reduce the appeal of human smugglers, and make it less likely that people would risk their lives to cross the border. It would ease the financial burden on state and local governments, by replacing illegal workers with lawful taxpayers. And above all, a temporary worker program would add to our security by making certain we know who is in our countryand why they are here. Third, we need to hold employers to account for the workers they hire. It is against the law to hire someone who is in this country illegally. Yet businesses often cannot verify the legal status of their employees because of the widespread problem of document fraud. Therefore, comprehensive immigration reform must include a better system for verifying documents and work eligibility. A key part of that system should be a new identification card for every legal foreign worker. This card should use biometric technology, such as digital fingerprints, to make it tamper-proof. A tamper-proof card would help us enforce the law, and leave employers with no excuse for violating it. And by making it harder for illegal immigrants to find work in our country, we would discourage people from crossing the border illegally in thefirst place. Fourth, we must face the reality that millions of illegal immigrants are here already. They should not be given an automatic path to citizenship. This is amnesty, and I oppose it. Amnesty would be unfair to those who are here lawfully, and it would invite further waves ofillegal immigration. Some in this country argue that the solution is to deport every illegal immigrant, and that any proposal short of this amounts to amnesty. I disagree. It is neither wise, nor realistic to round up millions of people, many with deep roots in the United States, and send them across the border. There is a rational middle ground between granting an automatic path to citizenship for every illegal immigrant, and a program of mass deportation. That middle ground recognizes there are differences between an illegal immigrant who crossed the border recently, and someone who has worked here for many years, and has a home, a family, andan otherwise clean record. I believe that illegal immigrants who have roots in our country and want to stay should have to pay a meaningful penalty for breaking the law, to pay their taxes, to learn English, and to work in a job for a number of years. People who meet these conditions should be able to apply for citizenship, but approval would not be automatic, and they will have to wait in line behind those who played by the rules and followed the law. What I've just described is not amnesty, it is a way for those who have broken the law to pay their debt to society, and demonstratethe character that makes a good citizen. Fifth, we must honor the great American tradition of the melting pot, which has made us one nation out of many peoples. The success of our country depends upon helping newcomers assimilate into our society, and embrace our common identity as Americans. Americans are bound together by our shared ideals, an appreciation of our history, respect for the flag we fly, and an ability to speak and write the English language. English is also the key to unlocking the opportunity of America. English allows newcomers to go from picking crops to opening a grocery, from cleaning offices to running offices, from a life of low-paying jobs to a diploma, a career, and a home of their own. When immigrants assimilate and advance in our society,they realize their dreams, they renew our spirit, and they add to the unity of America. Tonight, I want to speak directly to members of the House and the Senate: An immigration reform bill needs to be comprehensive, because all elements of this problem must be addressed together, or none of them will be solved at all. The House has passed an immigration bill. The Senate should act by the end of this month so we can work out the differences between the two bills, and Congress can pass a comprehensive bill for me to signinto law. America needs to conduct this debate on immigration in a reasoned and respectful tone. Feelings run deep on this issue, and as we work it out, all of us need to keep some things in mind. We cannot build a unified country by inciting people to anger, or playing on anyone's fears, or exploiting the issue of immigration for political gain. We must always remember that real lives will be affected by our debates and decisions, and that every human being hasdignity and value no matter what their citizenship papers say. I know many of you listening tonight have a parent or a grandparent who came here from another country with dreams of a better life. You know what freedom meant to them, and you know that America is a more hopeful country because of their hard work and sacrifice. As President, I've had the opportunity to meet people of many backgrounds, and hear what America means to them. On a visit to Bethesda Naval Hospital, Laura and I met a wounded Marine named Guadalupe Denogean. Master Gunnery Sergeant Denogean came to the United States from Mexico when he was a boy. He spent his summers picking crops with his family, and then he volunteered for the United States Marine Corps as soon as he was able. During the liberation of Iraq, Master Gunnery Sergeant Denogean was seriously injured. And when asked if he had any requests, he made two: a promotion for the corporal who helped rescue him, and the chance to become an American citizen. And when this brave Marine raised his right hand, and swore an oath to become a citizen of the country he had defended for morethan 26 years, I was honored to stand at his side. We will always be proud to welcome people like Guadalupe Denogean as fellow Americans. Our new immigrants are just what they've always been -- people willing to risk everything for the dream of freedom. And America remains what she has always been: the great hope on the horizon, an open door to the future, a blessed and promised land. We honor the heritage of all who come here, no matter where they come from, because we trust in our country's geniusfor making us all Americans -- one nation under God. Thank you, and good night.",bush
"Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress: It's a great privilege to be here to outline a new budget and a new approach for governing our great country. I thank you for your invitation to speak here tonight. I know Congress had to formally invite me, and it couldhave been a close vote. So, Mr. Vice President, I appreciate you being here to break the tie. I want to thank so many of you who have accepted my invitation to come to the White House to discuss important issues. We're off to a good start. I will continue to meet with you and ask for your input. You have been kind and candid, and I thank you for making a new Presidentfeel welcome. The last time I visited the Capitol, I came to take an oath on the steps of this building. I pledged to honor our Constitution and laws. And I asked you to join me in setting a tone ofcivility and respect in Washington. I hope America is noticing the difference, because we're making progress. Together, we are changing the tone in the Nation's Capital. And this spirit of respect and cooperation is vital, because, in the end, we will be judged not only by what we say or how we say it, we will bejudged by what we're able to accomplish. America today is a nation with great challenges, but greater resources. An artist using statistics as a brush could paint two very different pictures of our country. One would have warning signs: increasing layoffs, rising energy prices, too many failing schools, persistent poverty, the stubborn vestiges of racism. Another picture would be full of blessings: a balanced budget, big surpluses, a military that is second to none, a country at peace with its neighbors, technology that is revolutionizing the world, and our greatest strength -- concernedcitizens who care for our country and care for each other. Neither picture is complete in and of itself. And tonight I challenge and invite Congress to work with me to use the resources of one picture to repaint the other; to direct the advantages of our time to solve the problems of our people. Some of these resources willcome from government. Some, but not all. Year after year in Washington, budget debates seem to come down to an old, tired argument: on one side, those who want more government, regardless of the cost; on the other, those who want less government, regardless of the need. We should leave those arguments to thelast century, and chart a different course. Government has a role, and an important role. Yet, too much government crowds out initiative and hard work, private charity and the private economy. Our new governing vision says government should be active, but limited; engaged, but not overbearing. And my budgetis based on that philosophy. It is reasonable, and it is responsible. It meets our obligations, and funds our growing needs. We increase spending next year for Social Security and Medicare, and other entitlement programs, by $81 billion. We've increased spending for discretionary programs by a very responsible 4 percent, above the rate of inflation. My plan pays down an unprecedented amount of our national debt. And then, when money is still left over, my plan returns it to thepeople who earned it in the first place. A budget's impact is counted in dollars, but measured in lives. Excellent schools, quality health care, a secure retirement, a cleaner environment, a stronger defense -- these are all important needs, and we fund them. The highest percentage increase in our budget should go to our children's education. Education is not my top priority -- education is my top priorityand, by supporting this budget, you'll make it yours, as well. Reading is the foundation of all learning. So during the next five years, we triple spending, adding $5 billion to help every child in America learn to read. Values are important, so we've tripled funding for character education to teach our children not only reading and writing, butright from wrong. We've increased funding to train and recruit teachers, because we know a good education starts with a good teacher. And I have a wonderful partner in this effort. I like teachers so much, I married one. Laura has begun a new effort to recruit Americans to the profession that will shape our future -- teaching. She will travel across America to promote sound teachingpractices and early reading skills in our schools and in programs such as Head Start. When it comes to our schools, dollars alone do not always make the difference. Funding is important, and so is reform. So we must tie funding to higher standards and accountability forresults. I believe in local control of schools. We should not, and we will not, run public schools from Washington, D.C. Yet when the federal government spends tax dollars, we must insist on results. Children should be tested on basic reading and math skills every year between grades three and eight. Measuring is the only way to know whether all our children are learning. AndI want to know, because I refuse to leave any child behind in America. Critics of testing contend it distracts from learning. They talk about teaching to the test. But let's put that logic to the test. If you test a child on basic math and reading skills, and you're teaching to the test, you're teaching math and reading. And that's the whole idea. As standards rise, local schools will need more flexibility to meet them. So we must streamline the dozens of federal education programs into five, and let states spend money in thosecategories as they see fit. Schools will be given a reasonable chance to improve and the support to do so. Yet, if they don't, if they continue to fail, we must give parents and students different options -- a better public school, a private school, tutoring or a charter school. In the end, every child in a bad situation must be given a better choice because, when it comes to our children, failure issimply not an option. Another priority in my budget is to keep the vital promises of Medicare and Social Security, and together we will do so. To meet the health care needs of all America's seniors, we double the Medicare budget over the next 10 years. My budget dedicates $238 billion to Medicare next year alone, enough to fund all current programs and to begin a new prescription drug benefit for low-income seniors. No senior in America should have to choose between buyingfood and buying prescriptions. To make sure the retirement savings of America's seniors are not diverted in any other program, my budget protects all $2.6 trillion of the Social Security surplus for Social Security,and for Social Security alone. My budget puts a priority on access to health care, without telling Americans what doctor they have to see or what coverage they must choose. Many working Americans do not have health care coverage, so we will help them buy their own insurance with refundable tax credits. And to provide quality care in low-income neighborhoods, over the next five years we will doublethe number of people served at community health care centers. And we will address the concerns of those who have health coverage, yet worry their insurance company doesn't care and won't pay. Together this Congress and this President will find common ground to make sure doctors make medical decisions, and patients get thehealth care they deserve with a patients' bill of rights. When it comes to their health, people want to get the medical care they need, not be forced to go to court because they didn't get it. We will ensure access to the courts for those with legitimate claims. But first, let's put in place a strong, independent review so we promotequality health care, not frivolous lawsuits. My budget also increases funding for medical research, which gives hope to many who struggle with serious disease. Our prayers tonight are with one of your own who is engaged in his own fight against cancer -- a fine representative, and a good man, Congressman Joe Moakley. I can think of no more appropriate tribute to Joe than to have the Congress finishthe job of doubling the budget for the National Institutes of Health. My new Freedom Initiative for Americans with Disabilities funds new technologies, expands opportunities to work, and makes our society more welcoming. For the more than 50 millionAmericans with disabilities, we need to break down barriers to equality. The budget I propose to you also supports the people who keep our country strong and free, the men and women who serve in the United States military. I'm requesting $5.7 billion in increased military pay and benefits, and health care and housing. Our men and women inuniform give America their best and we owe them our support. America's veterans honored their commitment to our country through their military service. I will honor our commitment to them with a million-dollar increase to ensure better access toquality care and faster decisions on benefit claims. My budget will improve our environment by accelerating the cleanup of toxic brownfields. And I propose we make a major investment in conservation by fully funding the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Our national parks have a special place in our country's life. Our parks are places of great natural beauty and history. As good stewards, we must leave them better than we found them. So I propose providing $4.9 billion over five years for the upkeep of thesenational treasures. And my budget adopts a hopeful new approach to help the poor and the disadvantaged. We must encourage and support the work of charities and faith-based and community groups that offer help and love one person at a time. These groups are working in every neighborhood in America to fight homelessness and addiction and domestic violence; to provide a hot meal or a mentor or a safe haven for our children. Government should welcome these groups to applyfor funds, not discriminate against them. Government cannot be replaced by charities or volunteers. Government should not fund religious activities. But our nation should support the good works of these good people who are helping their neighbors in need. So I propose allowing all taxpayers, whether they itemize or not, to deduct their charitable contributions. Estimates show this could encourage as muchas $14 billion a year in new charitable giving, money that will save and change lives. Our budget provides more than $700 million over the next 10 years for a federal compassion capital fund, with a focused and noble mission, to provide a mentor to the more than 100 million children with a parent in prison, and to support other local efforts to fight illiteracy,teen pregnancy, drug addiction and other difficult problems. With us tonight is the Mayor of Philadelphia. Please help me welcome Mayor John Street. Mayor Street has encouraged faith-based and community organizations to make a significant difference in Philadelphia. He's invited me to his city this summer to see compassionate action. I'm personally aware of just how effective the Mayor is. Mayor Street's a Democrat. Let the record show, I lost his city, big time. But some things are bigger than politics. So Ilook forward to coming to your city, to see your faith-based programs in action. As government promotes compassion, it also must promote justice. Too many of our citizens have cause to doubt our nation's justice, when the law points a finger of suspicion at groups,instead of individuals. All our citizens are created equal, and must be treated equally. Earlier today, I asked John Ashcroft, the Attorney General, to develop specific recommendations to end racial profiling. It's wrong and we will end it in America. In so doing, we will not hinder the work of our nation's brave police officers. They protect us every day -- often at great risk. But by stopping the abuses of a few, we will add to the public confidenceour police officers earn and deserve. My budget has funded a responsible increase in our ongoing operations. It has funded our nation's important priorities. It has protected Social Security and Medicare. And our surplusesare big enough that there is still money left over. Many of you have talked about the need to pay down our national debt. I listened, and I agree. We owe it to our children and grandchildren to act now, and I hope you will join me to pay down $2 trillion in debt during the next 10 years. At the end of those 10 years, we will have paid down all the debt that is available to retire. That is more debt, repaid more quickly than has ever been repaid by any nation at any time inhistory. We should also prepare for the unexpected, for the uncertainties of the future. We should approach our nation's budget as any prudent family would, with a contingency fund for emergencies or additional spending needs. For example, after a strategic review, we may need to increase defense spending. We may need to increase spending for our farmers or additional money to reform Medicare. And so, my budget sets aside almost a trillion dollars over 10 years for additional needs. That is one trillion additional reasons you can feelcomfortable supporting this budget. We have increased our budget at a responsible 4 percent. We have funded our priorities. We paid down all the available debt. We have prepared for contingencies. And we still havemoney left over. Yogi Berra once said, ""When you come to a fork in the road, take it."" Now, we come to a fork in the road; we have two choices. Even though we have already met our needs, we could spend the money on more and bigger government. That's the road our nation has traveled inrecent years. Last year, government spending shot up 8 percent. That's far more than our economy grew, far more than personal income grew, and far more than the rate of inflation. If you continue on that road, you will spend the surplus and have to dip into Social Security to pay other bills. Unrestrained government spending is a dangerous road to deficits, so we must take a different path. The other choice is to let the American people spend their own money to meettheir own needs. I hope you will join me in standing firmly on the side of the people. You see, the growing surplus exists because taxes are too high and government is charging more than it needs. Thepeople of America have been overcharged and, on their behalf, I am here asking for a refund. Some say my tax plan is too big. Others say it's too small. I respectfully disagree. This plan is just right. I didn't throw darts at the board to come up with a number for tax relief. I didn't take a poll or develop an arbitrary formula that might sound good. I looked at problems in theTax Code and calculated the cost to fix them. A tax rate of 15 percent is too high for those who earn low wages, so we must lower the rate to 10 percent. No one should pay more than a third of the money they earn in federal incometaxes, so we lowered the top rate to 33 percent. This reform will be welcome relief for America's small businesses, which often pay taxes at the highest rate. And help for small business means jobs for Americans. We simplified the Tax Code by reducing the number of tax rates from the current five rates to four lower ones, 10 percent, 15, 25 and 33 percent. In my plan, no one is targeted in or targeted out. Everyonewho pays income taxes will get relief. Our government should not tax, and thereby discourage marriage, so we reduced the marriage penalty. I want to help families rear and support their children, so we doubled the child credit to $1,000 per child. It's not fair to tax the same earnings twice -- once when youearn them, and again when you die -- so we must repeal the death tax. These changes add up to significant help. A typical family with two children will save $1,600 a year on their federal income taxes. Now, $1,600 may not sound like a lot to some, but it means a lot to many families: $1,600 buys gas for two cars for an entire year; it pays tuition for a year at a community college; it pays the average family grocery bill for three months.That's real money. With us tonight representing many American families are Steven and Josefina Ramos. They are from Pennsylvania. But they could be from any one of your districts. Steven is the network administrator for a school district. Josefina is a Spanish teacher at a charter school. And theyhave a two-year-old daughter. Steven and Josefina tell me they pay almost $8,000 a year in federal income taxes. My plan will save them more than $2,000. Let me tell you what Steven says: ""Two thousand dollars a year means a lot to my family. If we had this money, it would help us reach our goal of paying off our personal debt in two years' time."" After that, Steven and Josefina want to start saving for Lianna's collegeeducation. My attitude is, government should never stand in the way of families achieving their dreams. And as we debate this issue, always remember, the surplus is not the government's money,the surplus is the people's money. For lower-income families, my tax plan restores basic fairness. Right now, complicated tax rules punish hard work. A waitress supporting two children on $25,000 a year can lose nearly half of every additional dollar she earns above the $25,000. Her overtime, her hardest hours, are taxed at nearly 20 percent. This sends a terrible message: you'll never get ahead. But America's message must be different. We must honor hard work, never punish it. With tax relief, overtime will no longer be over-taxed time for the waitress. People with the smallest incomes will get the highest percentage of reductions. And millions of additional Americanfamilies will be removed from the income tax rolls entirely. Tax relief is right and tax relief is urgent. The long economic expansion that began almost 10 years ago is faltering. Lower interest rates will eventually help, but we cannot assume theywill do the job all by themselves. Forty years ago, and then 20 years ago, two Presidents, one Democrat, one Republican, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, advocated tax cuts to, in President Kennedy's words, get this country moving again. They knew then what we must do now. To create economic growth and opportunity, we must put money back into the hands of the people who buy goods and createjobs. We must act quickly. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve has testified before Congress that tax cuts often come too late to stimulate economic recovery. So I want to work with you togive our economy an important jump-start by making tax relief retroactive. We must act now because it is the right thing to do. We must also act now because we have other things to do. We must show courage to confront and resolve tough challenges, to restructure our nation's defenses, to meet our growing need for energy, and to reformMedicare and Social Security. America has a window of opportunity to extend and secure our present peace by promoting a distinctly American internationalism. We will work with our allies and friends to be a force for good and a champion of freedom. We will work for free markets, free trade and freedom from oppression. Nations making progress toward freedom will find America is their friend. We will promote our values. We will promote the peace. And we need a strong military to keep thepeace. But our military was shaped to confront the challenges of the past. So I've asked the Secretary of Defense to review America's Armed Forces and prepare to transform them to meet emerging threats. My budget makes a down payment on the research and development that will be required. Yet, in our broader transformation effort, we must put strategy first,then spending. Our defense vision will drive our defense budget, not the other way around. Our nation also needs a clear strategy to confront the threats of the 21st century -- threats that are more widespread and less certain. They range from terrorists who threaten with bombs to tyrants in rogue nations intent upon developing weapons of mass destruction. To protect our own people, our allies and friends, we must develop and we must deploy effectivemissile defenses. And as we transform our military, we can discard Cold War relics, and reduce our own nuclear forces to reflect today's needs. A strong America is the world's best hope for peace andfreedom. Yet the cause of freedom rests on more than our ability to defend ourselves and our allies. Freedom is exported every day, as we ship goods and products that improve the lives of millions of people. Free trade brings greater political and personal freedom. Each of the previous five Presidents has had the ability to negotiate far reaching trade agreements. Tonight I ask you to give me the strong hand of presidential trade promotion authority, and todo so quickly. As we meet tonight, many citizens are struggling with the high cost of energy. We have a serious energy problem that demands a national energy policy. The West is confronting a major energy shortage that has resulted in high prices and uncertainty. I've asked federal agencies to work with California officials to help speed construction of new energy sources, and I have direct Vice President Cheney, Commerce Secretary Evans, Energy Secretary Abraham and other senior members in my administration to develop a nationalenergy policy. Our energy demand outstrips our supply. We can produce more energy at home while protecting our environment, and we must. We can produce more electricity to meet demand, and we must. We can promote alternative energy sources and conservation, and we must.America must become more energy-independent, and we will. Perhaps the biggest test of our foresight and courage will be reforming Medicare and Social Security. Medicare's finances are strained and its coverage is outdated. Ninety-nine percent of employer-provided health plans offer some form of prescription drug coverage; Medicare does not. The framework for reform has been developed by Senators Frist and Breaux andCongressman Thomas, and now is the time to act. Medicare must be modernized, and we must make sure that every senior on Medicare canchoose a health care plan that offers prescription drugs. Seven years from now, the baby boom generation will begin to claim Social Security benefits. Every one in this chamber knows that Social Security is not prepared to fully fund their retirement. And we only have a couple of years to get prepared. Without reform, this country will one day awaken to a stark choice: either a drastic rise in payroll taxes or a radical cut inretirement benefits. There is a better way. This spring I will form a presidential commission to reform Social Security. The commission will make its recommendations by next fall. Reform should be based on these principles: It must preserve the benefits of all current retirees and those nearing retirement. It must return Social Security to sound financial footing. And it must offerpersonal savings accounts to younger workers who want them. Social Security now offers workers a return of less than 2 percent on the money they pay into the system. To save the system, we must increase that by allowing younger workers to make safe, sound investments that yield a higher rate of return. Ownership, access to wealth and independence should not be the privilege of the few. Theyare the hope of every American, and we must make them the foundation of Social Security. By confronting the tough challenge of reform, by being responsible with our budget, we can earn the trust of the American people. And we can add to that trust by enacting fair andbalanced election and campaign reforms. The agenda I have set before you tonight is worthy of a great nation. America is a nation at peace, but not a nation at rest. Much has been given to us, and much is expected. Let us agree to bridge old divides. But let us also agree that our goodwill must be dedicated to greatgoals. Bipartisan is more than minding our matters. It is doing our duty. No one can speak in this Capitol and not be awed by its history. As so many turning points, debates in these chambers have reflected the collected or divided conscience of our country. And when we walk through Statuary Hall and see those men and women of marble, we'rereminded of their courage and achievement. Yet America's purpose is never found only in statues or history. America's purpose always stands before us. Our generation must show courage in a time of blessing, as our nation has always shown in times of crisis. And our courage, issue by issue, can gather to greatness and serve our country. This is the privilege and responsibility we share. And if we work together,we can prove that public service is noble. We all came here for a reason. We all have things we want to accomplish and promises tokeep. Juntos podemos -- together we can. We can make Americans proud of their government. Together we can share in the credit of making our country more prosperous and generous and just, and earn from our conscienceand from our fellow citizens the highest possible praise: Well done, good and faithful servants. Thank you all. Good night and God bless.",bush
"Ambassador Negroponte, General Hayden, members of the United States Congress, familieswho lost loved ones in the terrorist attacks on our nation, and my fellow citizens: Thanks forcoming. On the morning of September the 11th, 2001, our nation awoke to a nightmare attack.Nineteen men, armed with box cutters, took control of airplanes and turned them into missiles. They used them to kill nearly 3,000 innocent people. We watched the Twin Towerscollapse before our eyes -- and it became instantly clear that we'd entered a new world, and adangerous new war. The attacks of September the 11th horrified our nation. And amid the grief came new fears and urgent questions: Who had attacked us? What did they want? And what else were theyplanning? Americans saw the destruction the terrorists had caused in New York, and Washington, and Pennsylvania, and they wondered if there were other terrorist cells in ourmidst poised to strike; they wondered if there was a second wave of attacks still to come. With the Twin Towers and the Pentagon still smoldering, our country on edge, and a stream ofintelligence coming in about potential new attacks, my Administration faced immediate challenges: We had to respond to the attack on our country. We had to wage anunprecedented war against an enemy unlike any we had fought before. We had to find the terrorists hiding in America and across the world, before they were able to strike our countryagain. So in the early days and weeks after 9/11, I directed our government's senior nationalsecurity officials to do everything in their power, within our laws, to prevent another attack. Nearly five years have passed since these -- those initial days of shock and sadness -- and weare thankful that the terrorists have not succeeded in launching another attack on our soil. This is not for the lack of desire or determination on the part of the enemy. As the recently foiled plot in London shows, the terrorists are still active, and they're still trying to strikeAmerica, and they're still trying to kill our people. One reason the terrorists have not succeeded is because of the hard work of thousands of dedicated men and women in ourgovernment, who have toiled day and night, along with our allies, to stop the enemy fromcarrying out their plans. And we are grateful for these hardworking citizens of ours. Another reason the terrorists have not succeeded is because our government has changed itspolicies -- and given our military, intelligence, and law enforcement personnel the tools theyneed to fight this enemy and protect our people and preserve our freedoms. The terrorists who declared war on America represent no nation, they defend no territory, and they wear no uniform. They do not mass armies on borders, or flotillas of warships on thehigh seas. They operate in the shadows of society; they send small teams of operatives to infiltrate free nations; they live quietly among their victims; they conspire in secret, and thenthey strike without warning. In this new war, the most important source of information on where the terrorists are hiding and what they are planning is the terrorists, themselves.Captured terrorists have unique knowledge about how terrorist networks operate. They have knowledge of where their operatives are deployed, and knowledge about what plots areunderway. This intelligence -- this is intelligence that cannot be found any other place. And our security depends on getting this kind of information. To win the war on terror, we must beable to detain, question, and, when appropriate, prosecute terrorists captured here inAmerica, and on the battlefields around the world. After the 9/11 attacks, our coalition launched operations across the world to remove terrorist safe havens, and capture or kill terrorist operatives and leaders. Working with our allies, we've captured and detained thousands of terrorists and enemyfighters in Afghanistan, in Iraq, and other fronts of this war on terror. These enemy -- these are enemy combatants, who were waging war on our nation. We have a right under the lawsof war, and we have an obligation to the American people, to detain these enemies and stopthem from rejoining the battle. Most of the enemy combatants we capture are held in Afghanistan or in Iraq, where they'requestioned by our military personnel. Many are released after questioning, or turned over to local authorities -- if we determine that they do not pose a continuing threat and no longerhave significant intelligence value. Others remain in American custody near the battlefield, toensure that they don't return to the fight. In some cases, we determine that individuals we have captured pose a significant threat, or may have intelligence that we and our allies need to have to prevent new attacks. Many are alQaeda operatives or Taliban fighters trying to conceal their identities, and they withhold information that could save American lives. In these cases, it has been necessary to movethese individuals to an environment where they can be held secretly [sic], questioned byexperts, and -- when appropriate -- prosecuted for terrorist acts. Some of these individuals are taken to the United States Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. It's important for Americans and others across the world to understand the kind ofpeople held at Guantanamo. These aren't common criminals, or bystanders accidentally swept up on the battlefield -- we have in place a rigorous process to ensure those held atGuantanamo Bay belong at Guantanamo. Those held at Guantanamo include suspected bomb makers, terrorist trainers, recruiters and facilitators, and potential suicide bombers. They arein our custody so they cannot murder our people. One detainee held at Guantanamo told a questioner questioning him -- he said this: ""I'll never forget your face. I will kill you, yourbrothers, your mother, and sisters."" In addition to the terrorists held at Guantanamo, a small number of suspected terroristleaders and operatives captured during the war have been held and questioned outside the United States, in a separate program operated by the Central Intelligence Agency. This groupincludes individuals believed to be the key architects of the September the 11th attacks, and attacks on the USS Cole, an operative involved in the bombings of our embassies in Kenyaand Tanzania, and individuals involved in other attacks that have taken the lives of innocent civilians across the world. These are dangerous men with unparalleled knowledge aboutterrorist networks and their plans for new attacks. The security of our nation and the lives ofour citizens depend on our ability to learn what these terrorists know. Many specifics of this program, including where these detainees have been held and thedetails of their confinement, cannot be divulged. Doing so would provide our enemies with information they could use to take retribution against our allies and harm our country. I cansay that questioning the detainees in this program has given us information that has saved innocent lives by helping us stop new attacks -- here in the United States and across theworld. Today, I'm going to share with you some of the examples provided by our intelligence community of how this program has saved lives; why it remains vital to the security of theUnited States, and our friends and allies; and why it deserves the support of the United StatesCongress and the American people. Within months of September the 11th, 2001, we captured a man known as Abu Zubaydah. We believe that Zubaydah was a senior terrorist leader and a trusted associate of Osama binLaden. Our intelligence community believes he had run a terrorist camp in Afghanistan where some of the 9/11 hijackers trained, and that he helped smuggle al Qaeda leaders out ofAfghanistan after coalition forces arrived to liberate that country. Zubaydah was severely wounded during the firefight that brought him into custody -- and he survived only because ofthe medical care arranged by the CIA. After he recovered, Zubaydah was defiant and evasive. He declared his hatred of America. During questioning, he at first disclosed what he thought was nominal information -- and thenstopped all cooperation. Well, in fact, the ""nominal"" information he gave us turned out to be quite important. For example, Zubaydah disclosed Khalid Sheikh Mohammed -- or KSM -- was the mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks, and used the alias ""Muktar."" This was a vital piece ofthe puzzle that helped our intelligence community pursue KSM. Abu Zubaydah also provided information that helped stop a terrorist attack being planned for inside the United States -- anattack about which we had no previous information. Zubaydah told us that al Qaeda operatives were planning to launch an attack in the U.S., and provided physical descriptions ofthe operatives and information on their general location. Based on the information heprovided, the operatives were detained -- one while traveling to the United States. We knew that Zubaydah had more information that could save innocent lives, but he stoppedtalking. As his questioning proceeded, it became clear that he had received training on how to resist interrogation. And so the CIA used an alternative set of procedures. These procedures were designed to be safe, to comply with our laws, our Constitution, and our treatyobligations. The Department of Justice reviewed the authorized methods extensively and determined them to be lawful. I cannot describe the specific methods used -- I think you understand why -- if I did, it wouldhelp the terrorists learn how to resist questioning, and to keep information from us that we need to prevent new attacks on our country. But I can say the procedures were tough, andthey were safe, and lawful, and necessary. Zubaydah was questioned using these procedures, and soon he began to provide information on key al Qaeda operatives, including information that helped us find and capture more ofthose responsible for the attacks on September the 11th. For example, Zubaydah identified one of KSM's accomplices in the 9/11 attacks -- a terrorist named Ramzi bin al Shibh. Theinformation Zubaydah provided helped lead to the capture of bin al Shibh. And together these two terrorists provided information that helped in the planning and execution of the operationthat captured Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. Once in our custody, KSM was questioned by the CIA using these procedures, and he soonprovided information that helped us stop another planned attack on the United States. During questioning, KSM told us about another al Qaeda operative he knew was in CIA custody -- aterrorist named Majid Khan. KSM revealed that Khan had been told to deliver $50,000 to individuals working for a suspected terrorist leader named Hambali, the leader of al Qaeda'sSoutheast Asian affiliate known as ""J-I"". CIA officers confronted Khan with this information. Khan confirmed that the money had been delivered to an operative named Zubair, andprovided both a physical description and contact number for this operative. Based on that information, Zubair was captured in June of 2003, and he soon providedinformation that helped lead to the capture of Hambali. After Hambali's arrest, KSM was questioned again. He identified Hambali's brother as the leader of a ""J-I"" cell, and Hambali'sconduit for communications with al Qaeda. Hambali's brother was soon captured in Pakistan, and, in turn, led us to a cell of 17 Southeast Asian ""J-I"" operatives. When confronted with thenews that his terror cell had been broken up, Hambali admitted that the operatives were being groomed at KSM's request for attacks inside the United States -- probably [sic] usingairplanes. During questioning, KSM also provided many details of other plots to kill innocent Americans.For example, he described the design of planned attacks on buildings inside the United States, and how operatives were directed to carry them out. He told us the operatives had beeninstructed to ensure that the explosives went off at a point that was high enough to preventthe people trapped above from escaping out the windows. KSM also provided vital information on al Qaeda's efforts to obtain biological weapons. Duringquestioning, KSM admitted that he had met three individuals involved in al Qaeda's efforts to produce anthrax, a deadly biological agent -- and he identified one of the individuals as aterrorist named Yazid. KSM apparently believed we already had this information, because Yazid had been captured and taken into foreign custody before KSM's arrest. In fact, we didnot know about Yazid's role in al Qaeda's anthrax program. Information from Yazid then helped lead to the capture of his two principal assistants in the anthrax program. Without theinformation provided by KSM and Yazid, we might not have uncovered this al Qaeda biological weapons program, or stopped this al Qaeda cell from developing anthrax for attacks againstthe United States. These are some of the plots that have been stopped because of the information of this vitalprogram. Terrorists held in CIA custody have also provided information that helped stop a planned strike on U.S. Marines at Camp Lemonier in Djibouti -- they were going to use anexplosive laden water tanker. They helped stop a planned attack on the U.S. consulate in Karachi using car bombs and motorcycle bombs, and they helped stop a plot to hijackpassenger planes and fly them into Heathrow or the Canary Wharf in London. We're getting vital information necessary to do our jobs, and that's to protect the Americanpeople and our allies. Information from the terrorists in this program has helped us to identify individuals that al Qaeda deemed suitable for Western operations, many of whom we had never heard aboutbefore. They include terrorists who were set to case targets inside the United States, including financial buildings in major cities on the East Coast. Information from terrorists in CIA custodyhas played a role in the capture or questioning of nearly every senior al Qaeda member or associate detained by the U.S. and its allies since this program began. By providing everythingfrom initial leads to photo identifications, to precise locations of where terrorists were hiding, this program has helped us to take potential mass murderers off the streets before they wereable to kill. This program has also played a critical role in helping us understand the enemy we face in thiswar. Terrorists in this program have painted a picture of al Qaeda's structure and financing, and communications and logistics. They identified al Qaeda's travel routes and safe havens,and explained how al Qaeda's senior leadership communicates with its operatives in places like Iraq. They provided information that allows us -- that has allowed us to make sense of documentsand computer records that we have seized in terrorist raids. They've identified voices in recordings of intercepted calls, and helped us understand the meaning of potentially criticalterrorist communications. The information we get from these detainees is corroborated by intelligence, and we've received -- that we've received from other sources -- and together this intelligence has helpedus connect the dots and stop attacks before they occur. Information from the terrorists questioned in this program helped unravel plots and terrorist cells in Europe and in otherplaces. It's helped our allies protect their people from deadly enemies. This program has been, and remains, one of the most vital tools in our war against the terrorists. It is invaluable to America and to our allies. Were it not for this program, our intelligence community believesthat al Qaeda and its allies would have succeeded in launching another attack against the American homeland. By giving us information about terrorist plans we could not get anywhereelse, this program has saved innocent lives. This program has been subject to multiple legal reviews by the Department of Justice and CIA lawyers; they've determined it complied with our laws. This program has received strictoversight by the CIA's Inspector General. A small number of key leaders from both political parties on Capitol Hill were briefed about this program. All those involved in the questioning ofthe terrorists are carefully chosen and they're screened from a pool of experienced CIA officers. Those selected to conduct the most sensitive questioning had to complete more than 250 additional hours of specialized training before they are allowed to have contact with acaptured terrorist. I want to be absolutely clear with our people, and the world: The United States does not torture. It's against our laws, and it's against our values. I have not authorized it -- and I willnot authorize it. Last year, my Administration worked with Senator John McCain, and I signed into law the Detainee Treatment Act, which established the legal standard for treatment ofdetainees wherever they are held. I support this act. And as we implement this law, our government will continue to use every lawful method to obtain intelligence that can protectinnocent people, and stop another attack like the one we experienced on September the 11th,2001. The CIA program has detained only a limited number of terrorists at any given time -- and once we've determined that the terrorists held by the CIA have little or no additionalintelligence value, many of them have been returned to their home countries for prosecution or detention by their governments. Others have been accused of terrible crimes against the American people, and we have a dutyto bring those responsible for these crimes to justice. So we intend to prosecute these men,as appropriate, for their crimes. Soon after the war on terror began, I authorized a system of military commissions to tryforeign terrorists accused of war crimes. Military commissions have been used by Presidents from George Washington to Franklin Roosevelt to prosecute war criminals, because the rulesfor trying enemy combatants in a time of conflict must be different from those for trying common criminals or members of our own military. One of the first suspected terrorists to beput on trial by military commission was one of Osama bin Laden's bodyguards -- a man named Hamdan. His lawyers challenged the legality of the military commission system. It took more than two years for this case to make its way through the courts. The Court of Appealsfor the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the military commissions we had designed, but this past June, the Supreme Court overturned that decision. The Supreme Court determined thatmilitary commissions are an appropriate venue for trying terrorists, but ruled that militarycommissions needed to be explicitly authorized by the United States Congress. So today, I'm sending Congress legislation to specifically authorize the creation of militarycommissions to try terrorists for war crimes. My Administration has been working with members of both parties in the House and Senate on this legislation. We put forward a billthat ensures these commissions are established in a way that protects our national security, and ensures a full and fair trial for those accused. The procedures in the bill I am sending to Congress today reflect the reality that we are a nation at war, and that it's essential for us touse all reliable evidence to bring these people to justice. We're now approaching the five-year anniversary of the 9/11 attacks -- and the families of those murdered that day have waited patiently for justice. Some of the families are with ustoday -- they should have to wait no longer. So I'm announcing today that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Abu Zubaydah, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, and 11 other terrorists in CIA custody havebeen transferred to the United States Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay. They are being held in the custody of the Department of Defense. As soon as Congress acts to authorize the militarycommissions I have proposed, the men our intelligence officials believe orchestrated thedeaths of nearly 3,000 Americans on September the 11th, 2001, can face justice. We'll also seek to prosecute those believed to be responsible for the attack on the USS Cole, and an operative believed to be involved in the bombings of the American embassies in Kenyaand Tanzania. With these prosecutions, we will send a clear message to those who killAmericans: No longer -- how long it takes, we will find you and we will bring you to justice. These men will be held in a high-security facility at Guantanamo. The International Committeeof the Red Cross is being advised of their detention, and will have the opportunity to meet with them. Those charged with crimes will be given access to attorneys who will help themprepare their defense -- and they will be presumed innocent. While at Guantanamo, they will have access to the same food, clothing, medical care, and opportunities for worship as otherdetainees. They will be questioned subject to the new U.S. Army Field Manual, which the Department of Defense is issuing today. And they will continue to be treated with thehumanity that they denied others. As we move forward with the prosecutions, we will continue to urge nations across the world to take back their nationals at Guantanamo who will not be prosecuted by our military commissions. America has no interest in being the world's jailer. But one of the reasons wehave not been able to close Guantanamo is that many countries have refused to take back their nationals held at the facility. Other countries have not provided adequate assurancesthat their nationals will not be mistreated -- or they will not return to the battlefield, as more than a dozen people released from Guantanamo already have. We will continue working totransfer individuals held at Guantanamo, and ask other countries to work with us in this process. And we will move toward the day when we can eventually close the detention facilityat Guantanamo Bay. I know Americans have heard conflicting information about Guantanamo. Let me give you some facts. Of the thousands of terrorists captured across the world, only about 770 have ever been sent to Guantanamo. Of these, about 315 have been returned to other countries sofar -- and about 455 remain in our custody. They are provided the same quality of medical care as the American service members who guard them. The International Committee of theRed Cross has the opportunity to meet privately with all who are held there. The facility has been visited by government officials from more than 30 countries, and delegations frominternational organizations, as well. After the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe came to visit, one of its delegation members called Guantanamo ""a model prison""where people are treated better than in prisons in his own country. Our troops can take greatpride in the work they do at Guantanamo Bay -- and so can the American people. As we prosecute suspected terrorist leaders and operatives who have now been transferred to Guantanamo, we'll continue searching for those who have stepped forward to take theirplaces. This nation is going to stay on the offense to protect the American people. We will continue to bring the world's most dangerous terrorists to justice -- and we will continueworking to collect the vital intelligence we need to protect our country. The current transfers mean that there are now no terrorists in the CIA program. But as morehigh-ranking terrorists are captured, the need to obtain intelligence from them will remain critical -- and having a CIA program for questioning terrorists will continue to be crucial togetting life-saving information. Some may ask: Why are you acknowledging this program now? There are two reasons why I'm making these limited disclosures today. First, we have largely completed our questioningof the men -- and to start the process for bringing them to trial, we must bring them into the open. Second, the Supreme Court's recent decision has impaired our ability to prosecuteterrorists through military commissions, and has put in question the future of the CIA program. In its ruling on military commissions, the Court determined that a provision of the Geneva Conventions known as ""Common Article Three"" applies to our war with al Qaeda. Thisarticle includes provisions that prohibit ""outrages upon personal dignity"" and ""humiliating and degrading treatment."" The problem is that these and other provisions of Common ArticleThree are vague and undefined, and each could be interpreted in different ways by American or foreign judges. And some believe our military and intelligence personnel involved incapturing and questioning terrorists could now be at risk of prosecution under the War CrimesAct -- simply for doing their jobs in a thorough and professional way. This is unacceptable. Our military and intelligence personnel go face to face with the world'smost dangerous men every day. They have risked their lives to capture some of the most brutal terrorists on Earth. And they have worked day and night to find out what the terrorists know so we can stop new attacks. America owes our brave men and women some things inreturn. We owe them their thanks for saving lives and keeping America safe. And we owethem clear rules, so they can continue to do their jobs and protect our people. So today, I'm asking Congress to pass legislation that will clarify the rules for our personnelfighting the war on terror. First, I'm asking Congress to list the specific, recognizable offenses that would be considered crimes under the War Crimes Act -- so our personnel can knowclearly what is prohibited in the handling of terrorist enemies. Second, I'm asking that Congress make explicit that by following the standards of the Detainee Treatment Act ourpersonnel are fulfilling America's obligations under Common Article Three of the Geneva Conventions. Third, I'm asking that Congress make it clear that captured terrorists cannot use the Geneva Conventions as a basis to sue our personnel in courts -- in U.S. courts. The menand women who protect us should not have to fear lawsuits filed by terrorists because they'redoing their jobs. The need for this legislation is urgent. We need to ensure that those questioning terrorists cancontinue to do everything within the limits of the law to get information that can save American lives. My Administration will continue to work with the Congress to get thislegislation enacted -- but time is of the essence. Congress is in session just for a few moreweeks, and passing this legislation ought to be the top priority. As we work with Congress to pass a good bill, we will also consult with congressional leaderson how to ensure that the CIA program goes forward in a way that follows the law, that meets the national security needs of our country, and protects the brave men and women we ask toobtain information that will save innocent lives. For the sake of our security, Congress needsto act, and update our laws to meet the threats of this new era. And I know they will. We're engaged in a global struggle -- and the entire civilized world has a stake in its outcome. America is a nation of law. And as I work with Congress to strengthen and clarify our lawshere at home, I will continue to work with members of the international community who have been our partners in this struggle. I've spoken with leaders of foreign governments, andworked with them to address their concerns about Guantanamo and our detention policies. I'll continue to work with the international community to construct a common foundation todefend our nations and protect our freedoms. Free nations have faced new enemies and adjusted to new threats before -- and we haveprevailed. Like the struggles of the last century, today's war on terror is, above all, a struggle for freedom and liberty. The adversaries are different, but the stakes in this war are thesame: We're fighting for our way of life, and our ability to live in freedom. We're fighting for the cause of humanity, against those who seek to impose the darkness of tyranny and terrorupon the entire world. And we're fighting for a peaceful future for our children and ourgrandchildren. May God bless you all.",bush
"memory. Nineteen men attacked us with a barbarity unequaled in our history. They murdered people of all colors, creeds, and nationalities -- and made war upon the entire free world. Since that day, America and her allies have taken the offensive in a war unlike any we have fought before. Today, we are safer, but we are not yet safe. On this solemn night, I've asked for some of your time to discuss the nature of the threat still before us, what we are doing to protect our nation, and the building of a more hopeful Middle East that holds the key to peacefor America and the world. On 9/11, our nation saw the face of evil. Yet on that awful day, we also witnessed something distinctly American: ordinary citizens rising to the occasion, and responding with extraordinary acts of courage. We saw courage in office workers who were trapped on the high floors of burning skyscrapers -- and called home so that their last words to their families would be of comfort and love. We saw courage in passengers aboard Flight 93, who recited the 23rd Psalm -- and then charged the cockpit. And we saw courage in the Pentagon staff who made it out of the flames and smoke -- and ran back in to answer cries for help. On this day, we remember the innocent who lost their lives -- and we pay tribute to those who gave their lives so thatothers might live. For many of our citizens, the wounds of that morning are still fresh. I've met firefighters and police officers who choke up at the memory of fallen comrades. I've stood with families gathered on a grassy field in Pennsylvania, who take bittersweet pride in loved ones who refused to be victims -- and gave America our first victory in the war on terror. I've sat beside young mothers with children who are now five years old -- and still long for the daddies who will never cradle them in their arms. Out of this suffering, we resolve to honor every man andwoman lost. And we seek their lasting memorial in a safer and more hopeful world. Since the horror of 9/11, we've learned a great deal about the enemy. We have learned that they are evil and kill without mercy -- but not without purpose. We have learned that they form a global network of extremists who are driven by a perverted vision of Islam -- a totalitarian ideology that hates freedom, rejects tolerance, and despises all dissent. And we have learned that their goal is to build a radical Islamic empire where women are prisoners in their homes, men are beaten for missing prayer meetings, and terrorists have a safe haven to plan and launch attacks on America and other civilized nations. The war against this enemy is more than a military conflict. It is the decisive ideological struggle of the 21st century, and thecalling of our generation. Our nation is being tested in a way that we have not been since the start of the Cold War. We saw what a handful of our enemies can do with box-cutters and plane tickets. We hear their threats to launch even more terrible attacks on our people. And we know that if they were able to get their hands on weapons of mass destruction, they would use them against us. We face an enemy determined to bring death and suffering into our homes. America did not ask for this war, and every American wishes it were over. So do I. But the war is not over -- and it will not be over until either we or the extremists emerge victorious. If we do not defeat these enemies now, we will leave our children to face a Middle East overrun by terrorist states and radical dictators armed with nuclear weapons. We are in a war that will set the course for thisnew century -- and determine the destiny of millions across the world. For America, 9/11 was more than a tragedy -- it changed the way we look at the world. On September the 11th, we resolved that we would go on the offense against our enemies, and we would not distinguish between the terrorists and those who harbor or support them. So we helped drive the Taliban from power in Afghanistan. We put al Qaeda on the run, and killed or captured most of those who planned the 9/11 attacks, including the man believed to be the mastermind, Khalid Sheik Mohammed. He and other suspected terrorists have been questioned by the Central Intelligence Agency, and they provided valuable information that has helped stop attacks in America and across the world. Now these men have been transferred to Guantanamo Bay, so they can be held to account for their actions. Osama bin Laden and other terrorists are still in hiding. Our message to them is clear: No matter how long it takes, America will find you, and we willbring you to justice. On September the 11th, we learned that America must confront threats before they reach our shores, whether those threats come from terrorist networks or terrorist states. I'm often asked why we're in Iraq when Saddam Hussein was not responsible for the 9/11 attacks. The answer is that the regime of Saddam Hussein was a clear threat. My administration, the Congress, and the United Nations saw the threat -- and after 9/11, Saddam's regime posed a risk that the world could not afford to take. The world is safer because Saddam Hussein is no longer in power. And now the challenge is to help the Iraqi people build a democracy that fulfills the dreams of the nearly 12 million Iraqis who came out to vote in free elections lastDecember. Al Qaeda and other extremists from across the world have come to Iraq to stop the rise of a free society in the heart of the Middle East. They have joined the remnants of Saddam's regime and other armed groups to foment sectarian violence and drive us out. Our enemies in Iraq are tough and they are committed -- but so are Iraqi and coalition forces. We're adapting to stay ahead of the enemy, and we are carrying out a clear plan to ensure that a democraticIraq succeeds. We're training Iraqi troops so they can defend their nation. We're helping Iraq's unity government grow in strength and serve its people. We will not leave until this work is done. Whatever mistakes have been made in Iraq, the worst mistake would be to think that if we pulled out, the terrorists would leave us alone. They will not leave us alone. They will follow us. The safety of America depends on the outcome of the battle in the streets of Baghdad. Osama bin Laden calls this fight ""the Third World War"" -- and he says that victory for the terrorists in Iraq will mean America's ""defeat and disgrace forever."" If we yield Iraq to men like bin Laden, our enemies will be emboldened; they will gain a new safe haven; they will use Iraq's resources to fuel their extremist movement. We will not allow this to happen. Americawill stay in the fight. Iraq will be a free nation, and a strong ally in the war on terror. We can be confident that our coalition will succeed because the Iraqi people have been steadfast in the face of unspeakable violence. And we can be confident in victory because of the skill and resolve of America's Armed Forces. Every one of our troops is a volunteer, and since the attacks of September the 11th, more than 1.6 million Americans have stepped forward to put on our nation's uniform. In Iraq, Afghanistan, and other fronts in the war on terror, the men and women of our military are making great sacrifices to keep us safe. Some have suffered terrible injuries -- and nearly 3,000 have given their lives. America cherishes their memory. We pray for their families. And we will never back down from the work theyhave begun. We also honor those who toil day and night to keep our homeland safe, and we are giving them the tools they need to protect our people. We've created the Department of Homeland Security. We have torn down the wall that kept law enforcement and intelligence from sharing information. We've tightened security at our airports and seaports and borders, and we've created new programs to monitor enemy bank records and phone calls. Thanks to the hard work of our law enforcement and intelligence professionals, we have broken up terrorist cellsin our midst and saved American lives. Five years after 9/11, our enemies have not succeeded in launching another attack on our soil, but they've not been idle. Al Qaeda and those inspired by its hateful ideology have carried out terrorist attacks in more than two dozen nations. And just last month, they were foiled in a plot to blow up passenger planes headed for the United States. They remain determined to attack America and kill our citizens -- and we are determined to stop them. We'll continue to give the men and women who protect us every resource and legal authoritythey need to do their jobs. In the first days after the 9/11 attacks I promised to use every element of national power to fight the terrorists, wherever we find them. One of the strongest weapons in our arsenal is the power of freedom. The terrorists fear freedom as much as they do our firepower. They are thrown into panic at the sight of an old man pulling the election lever, girls enrolling in schools, or families worshiping God in their own traditions. They know that given a choice, people will choose freedom over their extremist ideology. So their answer is to deny people this choice by raging against the forces of freedom and moderation. This struggle has been called a clash of civilizations. In truth, it is a struggle for civilization. We are fighting to maintain the way of life enjoyed by free nations. And we're fighting for the possibility that good and decent people across theMiddle East can raise up societies based on freedom and tolerance and personal dignity. We are now in the early hours of this struggle between tyranny and freedom. Amid the violence, some question whether the people of the Middle East want their freedom, and whether the forces of moderation can prevail. For 60 years, these doubts guided our policies in the Middle East. And then, on a bright September morning, it became clear that the calm we saw in the Middle East was only a mirage. Years of pursuing stability to promote peace had left us with neither. So we changed our policies, and committed America's influence in the world to advancing freedom and democracy as the great alternatives to repression andradicalism. With our help, the people of the Middle East are now stepping forward to claim their freedom. From Kabul to Baghdad to Beirut, there are brave men and women risking their lives each day for the same freedoms that we enjoy. And they have one question for us: Do we have the confidence to do in the Middle East what our fathers and grandfathers accomplished in Europe and Asia? By standing with democratic leaders and reformers, by giving voice to the hopes of decent men and women, we're offering a path away from radicalism. And we are enlisting the most powerful force for peace and moderation in the Middle East: the desire of millions to befree. Across the broader Middle East, the extremists are fighting to prevent such a future. Yet America has confronted evil before, and we have defeated it -- sometimes at the cost of thousands of good men in a single battle. When Franklin Roosevelt vowed to defeat two enemies across two oceans, he could not have foreseen D-Day and Iwo Jima -- but he would not have been surprised at the outcome. When Harry Truman promised American support for free peoples resisting Soviet aggression, he could not have foreseen the rise of the Berlin Wall -- but he would not have been surprised to see it brought down. Throughout our history, America has seen liberty challenged, and every time, we have seen liberty triumph withsacrifice and determination. At the start of this young century, America looks to the day when the people of the Middle East leave the desert of despotism for the fertile gardens of liberty, and resume their rightful place in a world of peace and prosperity. We look to the day when the nations of that region recognize their greatest resource is not the oil in the ground, but the talent and creativity of their people. We look to the day when moms and dads throughout the Middle East see a future of hope and opportunity for their children. And when that good day comes, the clouds of war will part, the appeal of radicalism will decline, and we will leave our children with abetter and safer world. On this solemn anniversary, we rededicate ourselves to this cause. Our nation has endured trials, and we face a difficult road ahead. Winning this war will require the determined efforts of a unified country, and we must put aside our differences and work together to meet the test that history has given us. We will defeat our enemies. We will protect our people. And wewill lead the 21st century into a shining age of human liberty. Earlier this year, I traveled to the United States Military Academy. I was there to deliver the commencement address to the first class to arrive at West Point after the attacks of September the 11th. That day I met a proud mom named RoseEllen Dowdell. She was there to watch her son, Patrick, accept his commission in the finest Army the world has ever known. A few weeks earlier, RoseEllen had watched her other son, James, graduate from the Fire Academy in New York City. On both these days, her thoughts turned to someone who was not there to share the moment: her husband, Kevin Dowdell. Kevin was one of the 343 firefighters who rushed to the burning towers of the World Trade Center on September the 11th -- and never came home. His sons lost their father that day, but not the passion for service he instilled in them. Here is what RoseEllen says about her boys: ""As a mother, I cross my fingers and pray all the time for their safety -- but as worried as I am, I'm also proud, and Iknow their dad would be, too."" Our nation is blessed to have young Americans like these -- and we will need them. Dangerous enemies have declared their intention to destroy our way of life. They're not the first to try, and their fate will be the same as those who tried before. Nine-Eleven showed us why. The attacks were meant to bring us to our knees, and they did, but not in the way the terrorists intended. Americans united in prayer, came to the aid of neighbors in need, and resolved that our enemies would not have the last word. The spirit of our people is the source of America's strength. And we go forward with trust in that spirit, confidence in our purpose, and faith in aloving God who made us to be free. Thank you, and may God bless you.",bush
"President Bush: Good afternoon, and welcome to the White House. Earlier today I announced my intent to nominate Robert Gates to be the next Secretary of the Defense. And now I'm pleased to introduce him to the American people. I also am looking forward to payingtribute to the man he will succeed. America remains a nation at war. We face brutal enemies who despise our freedom and want to destroy our way of life. These enemies attacked our country on September the 11th, 2001; they fight us in Afghanistan and Iraq, and they remain determined to attack our country again. Against such enemies, there's only one way to protect the American people: We muststay on the offense and bring our enemies to justice before they hurt us again. In this time of war, the President relies on the Secretary of Defense to provide military advice and direct our nation's Armed Forces as they engage our enemies across the world. The Secretary of Defense must be a man of vision who can see threats still over the horizon, and prepare our nation to meet them. Bob Gates is the right man to meet both of these criticalchallenges. Bob is one of our nation's most accomplished public servants. He joined the CIA in 1966, and has nearly 27 years of national security experience, serving six Presidents of both political parties. He spent nearly nine years serving on the National Security Council staff. And at the CIA, he rose from an entry-level employee to become the Director of the Central Intelligence.And his experience has prepared him well for this new assignment. Bob understands the challenges we face in Afghanistan. As President Reagan's Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, he helped lead America's efforts to drive Soviet forces from Afghanistan. Success in these efforts weakened the Soviet regime and helped hastenfreedom's victory in the Cold War. Bob understands the challenges facing our nation in Iraq. He served as Deputy National Security Advisor to the first President Bush during Operation Desert Storm as American troops repelled Iraqi aggression and drove Saddam Hussein's forces from Kuwait. More recently, he served as a member of the Iraq Study Group, a distinguished independent panel of Republicans and Democrats led by former Secretary of State Jim Baker and former Congressman Lee Hamilton. As part of this commission, he has traveled to Iraq and met with the country's leaders and our military commanders on the ground. He'll provide the department with a fresh perspective and new ideas on how America can achieve our goals inIraq. Bob understands how to lead large, complex institutions and transform them to meet new challenges. As Director of Central Intelligence, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, he was responsible for leading all the foreign intelligence agencies of the United States. And he's brought that same leadership and abilities as his work as President of our nation's sixth largest university, Texas A&M. When the A&M board of regents interviewed him for the job, he described himself as an agent of change. As president, he delivered on that promise, initiating wide-ranging reforms to almost every aspect of campus life. He'll bring that sametransformational spirit to his work in the Department of Defense. Bob Gates is a patriot whose love for country was nurtured in the Kansas community where he was raised. He's worn our nation's uniform. He's a strategic thinker who was educated at three of America's finest universities, receiving his bachelor's degree from William & Mary, a master's degree in history from Indiana University, and a doctorate in Russian and Soviethistory from Georgetown. He's a leader in the business community who served on the boards of several major corporations. He's a man of integrity, candor and sound judgment. He knows that the challenge of protecting our country is larger than any political party, and he has a record of working with leaders of both sides of the aisle to strengthen our national security. He has myconfidence and my trust, and he will be an outstanding Secretary of Defense. Bob follows in the footsteps of one of America's most skilled and capable national security leaders, Donald Rumsfeld. Don is the longest-serving member of my Cabinet, and next month he will reach another milestone when he becomes the longest-serving Secretary of Defense in the history of our nation. I appreciate his willingness to continue serving until his successor is in place, because in a time of war, our nation cannot be without a strong and steady handleading our Department of Defense. Don has served in times of great consequence for our nation. Few will forget the image of Don Rumsfeld as he helped rescue workers carry the victims from the rubble of the Pentagon on September the 11th, 2001. In the weeks that followed, he directed the effort to plan our nation's military response to an unprecedented attack on our soil. Under his leadership, U.S. and coalition forces launched one of the most innovative military campaigns in the history ofmodern warfare, driving the Taliban and its al Qaeda allies from power in a matter of weeks. In 2003, on my orders, he led the planning and execution of another historic military campaign, Operation Iraqi Freedom, that drove Saddam Hussein from power and helped the Iraqi people establish a constitutional democracy in the heart of the Middle East. History will record that on Don Rumsfeld's watch, the men and women of our military overthrew two terrorist regimes, liberated some 50 million people, brought justice to the terrorist Zarqawiand scores of senior al Qaeda operatives, and helped stop new terrorist attacks on our people. America is safer and the world is more secure because of the service and the leadership of Donald Rumsfeld. As he led the Pentagon in an unprecedented war, Don never took his eye off another vital responsibility, preparing America for the threats that await us as this new century unfolds. He developed a new defense strategy. He established a new Northern Command to protect the homeland, a new Joint Forces Command to focus on transformation, a new Strategic Command to defend against long-range attack, and transformed the U.S.Special Operations Command for the war on terror. He led our efforts to create a new NATO Response Force that allows NATO to deploy rapidly anywhere in the world. He undertook the most sweeping transformation of America's global force posture since the end of World War II. He revitalized America's efforts to develop and deploy ballistic missile defenses, and led a comprehensive review of America's nuclear forcesthat has allowed us to undertake dramatic reductions in offensive nuclear weapons. Don's work in these areas did not often make the headlines. But the reforms that he has set in motion are historic, and they will enhance the security of the American people for decades tocome. Over the past six years, I've relied on Don Rumsfeld's advice and counsel. I've come to know his character and his integrity. As the Secretary of Defense, he has been dedicated to his mission, loyal to his President, and devoted to the courageous men and women of our ArmedForces. Don once famously said, ""There are known knowns; there are known unknowns; and there are unknown unknowns."" Well, Mr. Secretary, here is a known known: Your service has made America stronger, and made America a safer nation. You will be missed, and I wish you andJoyce all the best in the years to come. Don Rumsfeld is a tough act to follow. That's why I picked a man of Bob Gates's caliber to succeed him. When confirmed by the Senate, Bob will bring talent, energy and innovation to the Department of Defense. He'll work every day to keep the American people safe and to make our nation more secure. And he'll do a superb job as America's next Secretary ofDefense. Bob, I appreciate you agreeing to serve our nation again, and congratulations. Robert Gates: Thank you, sir. Mr. President, thank you for this high honor and for your confidence. And let me add my thanks to Secretary Rumsfeld for his service. I entered public service 40 years ago last August. President Bush will be the seventh President I have served. I had not anticipated returning to government service, and have never enjoyed any position more than being president of Texas A&M University. However, the United States is at war, in Iraq and Afghanistan. We're fighting against terrorism worldwide. And we face other serious challenges to peace and our security. I believe the outcome of these conflicts will shape our world for decades to come. Because our long-term strategic interests and our national and homeland security are at risk, because so many of America's sons and daughters in our Armed Forces are in harm's way, I did not hesitate when thePresident asked me to return to duty. If confirmed by the Senate, I will serve with all my heart, and with gratitude to the Presidentfor giving me the opportunity to do so. Secretary Rumsfeld: Bob Gates, my congratulations to you on this nomination. My very bestwishes. Look forward to working with you in the transition. Mr. President, thank you for your kind words, and the wholly unexpected opportunity you provided me to serve in the Department of Defense again these past years -- six years. It's been quite a time. It recalls to mind the statement by Winston Churchill, something to the effect that ""I have benefited greatly from criticism, and at no time have I suffered a lackthereof."" The great respect that I have for your leadership, Mr. President, in this little understood, unfamiliar war, the first war of the 21st century -- it is not well-known, it was not well- understood, it is complex for people to comprehend. And I know, with certainty, that overtime the contributions you've made will be recorded by history. I must say that it's been the highest honor of my life to serve with the talented men and women of the Department of Defense, the amazing men and women -- young men and women in uniform. It's a privilege. And their patriotism, their professionalism, their dedicationis truly an inspiration. They have my respect; they will remain in my prayers always. Thank you.",bush
"Thank you very much. And tonight, I have a high privilege and distinct honor of my own -- as the first President to begin the State of the Union message with these words: MadamSpeaker. In his day, the late Congressman Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr. from Baltimore, Maryland, saw Presidents Roosevelt and Truman at this rostrum. But nothing could compare with the sight of his only daughter, Nancy, presiding tonight as Speaker of the House of Representatives.Congratulations, Madam Speaker. Two members of the House and Senate are not with us tonight, and we pray for the recoveryand speedy return of Senator Tim Johnson and Congressman Charlie Norwood. Madam Speaker, Vice President Cheney, members of Congress, distinguished guests, andfellow citizens: The rite of custom brings us together at a defining hour -- when decisions are hard and courage is needed. We enter the year 2007 with large endeavors underway, and others that are ours to begin. In all of this, much is asked of us. We must have the will to face difficultchallenges and determined enemies -- and the wisdom to face them together. Some in this chamber are new to the House and the Senate -- and I congratulate the Democrat majority. Congress has changed, but not our responsibilities. Each of us is guided by our own convictions -- and to these we must stay faithful. Yet we're all held to the same standards, and called to serve the same good purposes: To extend this nation's prosperity; to spend the people's money wisely; to solve problems, not leave them to future generations; toguard America against all evil; and to keep faith with those we have sent forth to defend us. We're not the first to come here with a government divided and uncertainty in the air. Like many before us, we can work through our differences, and achieve big things for the American people. Our citizens don't much care which side of the aisle we sit on -- as long as we're willing to cross that aisle when there is work to be done. Our job is to make life better for our fellow Americans, and to help them to build a future of hope and opportunity -- and this is thebusiness before us tonight. A future of hope and opportunity begins with a growing economy -- and that is what we have. We're now in the 41st month of uninterrupted job growth, in a recovery that has created 7.2 million new jobs -- so far. Unemployment is low, inflation is low, and wages are rising. This economy is on the move, and our job is to keep it that way, not with more government, butwith more enterprise. Next week, I'll deliver a full report on the state of our economy. Tonight, I want to discussthree economic reforms that deserve to be priorities for this Congress. First, we must balance the federal budget. We can do so without raising taxes. What we need to do is impose spending discipline in Washington, D.C. We set a goal of cutting the deficit in half by 2009, and met that goal three years ahead of schedule. Now let us take the next step. In the coming weeks, I will submit a budget that eliminates the federal deficit within the next five years. I ask you to make the same commitment. Together, we can restrain the spendingappetite of the federal government, and we can balance the federal budget. Next, there is the matter of earmarks. These special interest items are often slipped into bills at the last hour -- when not even C-SPAN is watching. In 2005 alone, the number of earmarks grew to over 13,000 and totaled nearly $18 billion. Even worse, over 90 percent of earmarks never make it to the floor of the House and Senate -- they are dropped into committee reports that are not even part of the bill that arrives on my desk. You didn't vote them into law. I didn't sign them into law. Yet, they're treated as if they have the force of law. The time has come to end this practice. So let us work together to reform the budget process, expose every earmark to the light of day and to a vote in Congress, and cut the number and cost ofearmarks at least in half by the end of this session. And, finally, to keep this economy strong we must take on the challenge of entitlements. Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid are commitments of conscience, and so it is our duty to keep them permanently sound. Yet, we're failing in that duty. And this failure will one day leave our children with three bad options: huge tax increases, huge deficits, or huge and immediate cuts in benefits. Everyone in this chamber knows this to be true -- yet somehow we have not found it in ourselves to act. So let us work together and do it now. With enoughgood sense and goodwill, you and I can fix Medicare and Medicaid -- and save Social Security. Spreading opportunity and hope in America also requires public schools that give children the knowledge and character they need in life. Five years ago, we rose above partisan differences to pass the No Child Left Behind Act, preserving local control, raising standards, and holding those schools accountable for results. And because we acted, students are performing betterin reading and math, and minority students are closing the achievement gap. Now the task is to build on the success, without watering down standards, without taking control from local communities, and without backsliding and calling it reform. We can lift student achievement even higher by giving local leaders flexibility to turn around failing schools, and by giving families with children stuck in failing schools the right to choose someplace better. We must increase funds for students who struggle -- and make sure these children get the special help they need. And we can make sure our children are prepared for the jobs of the future and our country is more competitive by strengthening math and science skills. The No Child Left Behind Act has worked for America's children -- and I ask Congress to reauthorizethis good law. A future of hope and opportunity requires that all our citizens have affordable and available health care. When it comes to health care, government has an obligation to care for the elderly, the disabled, and poor children. And we will meet those responsibilities. For all other Americans, private health insurance is the best way to meet their needs. But many Americanscannot afford a health insurance policy. And so tonight, I propose two new initiatives to help more Americans afford their own insurance. First, I propose a standard tax deduction for health insurance that will be like the standard tax deduction for dependents. Families with health insurance will pay no income on payroll tax -- or payroll taxes on $15,000 of their income. Single Americans with health insurance will pay no income or payroll taxes on $7,500 of their income. With this reform, more than 100 million men, women, and children who are now covered by employer-provided insurance will benefit from lower tax bills. At the same time, this reform will level the playing field for those who do not get health insurance through their job. For Americans who now purchase health insurance on their own, this proposal would mean a substantial tax savings -- $4,500 for a family of four making $60,000 a year. And for the millions of other Americans who have no health insurance at all, this deduction would help put a basic private health insurance plan within their reach. Changing the tax code is a vital and necessary step tomaking health care affordable for more Americans. My second proposal is to help the states that are coming up with innovative ways to cover the uninsured. States that make basic private health insurance available to all their citizens should receive federal funds to help them provide this coverage to the poor and the sick. I have asked the Secretary of Health and Human Services to work with Congress to take existing federal funds and use them to create ""Affordable Choices"" grants. These grants would give our nation's governors more money and more flexibility to get private health insurance to thosemost in need. There are many other ways that Congress can help. We need to expand Health Savings Accounts. We need to help small businesses through Association Health Plans. We need to reduce costs and medical errors with better information technology. We will encourage price transparency. And to protect good doctors from junk lawsuits, we passing medical liability reform. In all we do, we must remember that the best health care decisions are made not bygovernment and insurance companies, but by patients and their doctors. Extending hope and opportunity in our country requires an immigration system worthy of America -- with laws that are fair and borders that are secure. When laws and borders are routinely violated, this harms the interests of our country. To secure our border, we'redoubling the size of the Border Patrol, and funding new infrastructure and technology. Yet even with all these steps, we cannot fully secure the border unless we take pressure off the border -- and that requires a temporary worker program. We should establish a legal and orderly path for foreign workers to enter our country to work on a temporary basis. As a result, they won't have to try to sneak in, and that will leave Border Agents free to chase down drug smugglers and criminals and terrorists. We'll enforce our immigration laws at the work site and give employers the tools to verify the legal status of their workers, so there's noexcuse left for violating the law. We need to uphold the great tradition of the melting pot that welcomes and assimilates new arrivals. We need to resolve the status of the illegal immigrants who are already in our country without animosity and without amnesty. Convictions run deep in this Capitol when it comes to immigration. Let us have a serious, civil, and conclusive debate, so that you canpass, and I can sign, comprehensive immigration reform into law. Extending hope and opportunity depends on a stable supply of energy that keeps America's economy running and America's environment clean. For too long our nation has been dependent on foreign oil. And this dependence leaves us more vulnerable to hostile regimes, and to terrorists -- who could cause huge disruptions of oil shipments, and raise the price ofoil, and do great harm to our economy. It's in our vital interest to diversify America's energy supply -- the way forward is through technology. We must continue changing the way America generates electric power, by even greater use of clean coal technology, solar and wind energy, and clean, safe nuclear power. We need to press on with battery research for plug-in and hybrid vehicles, and expand the use of clean diesel vehicles and biodiesel fuel. We must continue investing in new methods ofproducing ethanol -- using everything from wood chips to grasses, to agricultural wastes. We made a lot of progress, thanks to good policies here in Washington and the strong response of the market. And now even more dramatic advances are within reach. Tonight, I ask Congress to join me in pursuing a great goal. Let us build on the work we've done and reduce gasoline usage in the United States by 20 percent in the next 10 years. When we do that we will have cut our total imports by the equivalent of three-quarters of all the oil we nowimport from the Middle East. To reach this goal, we must increase the supply of alternative fuels, by setting a mandatory fuels standard to require 35 billion gallons of renewable and alternative fuels in 2017 -- and that is nearly five times the current target. At the same time, we need to reform and modernize fuel economy standards for cars the way we did for light trucks -- and conserve upto 8.5 billion more gallons of gasoline by 2017. Achieving these ambitious goals will dramatically reduce our dependence on foreign oil, but it's not going to eliminate it. And so as we continue to diversify our fuel supply, we must step up domestic oil production in environmentally sensitive ways. And to further protect America against severe disruptions to our oil supply, I ask Congress to double the current capacity ofthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve. America is on the verge of technological breakthroughs that will enable us to live our lives less dependent on oil. And these technologies will help us be better stewards of the environment,and they will help us to confront the serious challenge of global climate change. A future of hope and opportunity requires a fair, impartial system of justice. The lives of our citizens across our nation are affected by the outcome of cases pending in our federal courts. We have a shared obligation to ensure that the federal courts have enough judges to hear those cases and deliver timely rulings. As President, I have a duty to nominate qualified men and women to vacancies on the federal bench. And the United States Senate has a duty, as well, to give those nominees a fair hearing, and a prompt up-or-down vote on the Senatefloor. For all of us in this room, there is no higher responsibility than to protect the people of this country from danger. Five years have come and gone since we saw the scenes and felt the sorrow that the terrorists can cause. We've had time to take stock of our situation. We've added many critical protections to guard the homeland. We know with certainty that the horrors of that September morning were just a glimpse of what the terrorists intend for us --unless we stop them. With the distance of time, we find ourselves debating the causes of conflict and the course we have followed. Such debates are essential when a great democracy faces great questions. Yet one question has surely been settled: that to win the war on terror we must take the fight tothe enemy. From the start, America and our allies have protected our people by staying on the offense. The enemy knows that the days of comfortable sanctuary, easy movement, steady financing, and free flowing communications are long over. For the terrorists, life since 9/11 has neverbeen the same. Our success in this war is often measured by the things that did not happen. We cannot know the full extent of the attacks that we and our allies have prevented, but here is some of what we do know: We stopped an al Qaeda plot to fly a hijacked airplane into the tallest building on the West Coast. We broke up a Southeast Asian terror cell grooming operatives for attacks inside the United States. We uncovered an al Qaeda cell developing anthrax to be used in attacks against America. And just last August, British authorities uncovered a plot to blow up passenger planes bound for America over the Atlantic Ocean. For each life saved, we owe a debt of gratitude to the brave public servants who devote their lives to finding the terroristsand stopping them. Every success against the terrorists is a reminder of the shoreless ambitions of this enemy. The evil that inspired and rejoiced in 9/11 is still at work in the world. And so long as that'sthe case, America is still a nation at war. In the mind of the terrorist, this war began well before September the 11th, and will not end until their radical vision is fulfilled. And these past five years have given us a much clearer view of the nature of this enemy. Al Qaeda and its followers are Sunni extremists, possessed by hatred and commanded by a harsh and narrow ideology. Take almost any principle of civilization, and their goal is the opposite. They preach withthreats, instruct with bullets and bombs, and promise paradise for the murder of the innocent. Our enemies are quite explicit about their intentions. They want to overthrow moderate governments, and establish safe havens from which to plan and carry out new attacks on our country. By killing and terrorizing Americans, they want to force our country to retreat from the world and abandon the cause of liberty. They would then be free to impose their will and spread their totalitarian ideology. Listen to this warning from the late terrorist Zarqawi: ""We will sacrifice our blood and bodies to put an end to your dreams, and what is coming is even worse."" Osama bin Laden declared: ""Death is better than living on this Earth with theunbelievers among us."" These men are not given to idle words, and they are just one camp in the Islamist radical movement. In recent times, it has also become clear that we face an escalating danger from Shia extremists who are just as hostile to America, and are also determined to dominate the Middle East. Many are known to take direction from the regime in Iran, which is funding and arming terrorists like Hezbollah -- a group second only to al Qaeda in the American lives it hastaken. The Shia and Sunni extremists are different faces of the same totalitarian threat. Whatever slogans they chant, when they slaughter the innocent they have the same wicked purposes. They want to kill Americans, kill democracy in the Middle East, and gain the weapons to kill onan even more horrific scale. In the sixth year since our nation was attacked, I wish I could report to you that the dangers had ended. They have not. And so it remains the policy of this government to use every lawful and proper tool of intelligence, diplomacy, law enforcement, and military action to do ourduty, to find these enemies, and to protect the American people. This war is more than a clash of arms -- it is a decisive ideological struggle, and the security of our nation is in the balance. To prevail, we must remove the conditions that inspire blind hatred, and drove 19 men to get onto airplanes and to come and kill us. What every terrorist fears most is human freedom -- societies where men and women make their own choices, answer to their own conscience, and live by their hopes instead of their resentments. Free people are not drawn to violent and malignant ideologies -- and most will choose a better way when they're given a chance. So we advance our own security interests by helping moderates and reformers and brave voices for democracy. The great question of our day is whether America will help men and women in the Middle East to build free societies and sharein the rights of all humanity. And I say, for the sake of our own security, we must. In the last two years, we've seen the desire for liberty in the broader Middle East -- and we have been sobered by the enemy's fierce reaction. In 2005, the world watched as the citizens of Lebanon raised the banner of the Cedar Revolution, they drove out the Syrian occupiers and chose new leaders in free elections. In 2005, the people of Afghanistan defied the terrorists and elected a democratic legislature. And in 2005, the Iraqi people held three national elections, choosing a transitional government, adopting the most progressive, democratic constitution in the Arab world, and then electing a government under that constitution. Despite endless threats from the killers in their midst, nearly 12 million Iraqicitizens came out to vote in a show of hope and solidarity that we should never forget. A thinking enemy watched all of these scenes, adjusted their tactics, and in 2006 they struck back. In Lebanon, assassins took the life of Pierre Gemayel, a prominent participant in the Cedar Revolution. Hezbollah terrorists, with support from Syria and Iran, sowed conflict in the region and are seeking to undermine Lebanon's legitimately elected government. In Afghanistan, Taliban and al Qaeda fighters tried to regain power by regrouping and engaging Afghan and NATO forces. In Iraq, al Qaeda and other Sunni extremists blew up one of the most sacred places in Shia Islam -- the Golden Mosque of Samarra. This atrocity, directed at a Muslim house of prayer, was designed to provoke retaliation from Iraqi Shia -- and it succeeded. Radical Shia elements, some of whom receive support from Iran, formed death squads. The result was a tragic escalation of sectarian rage and reprisal that continues to thisday. This is not the fight we entered in Iraq, but it is the fight we're in. Every one of us wishes this war were over and won. Yet it would not be like us to leave our promises unkept, our friends abandoned, and our own security at risk. Ladies and gentlemen: On this day, at this hour, it is still within our power to shape the outcome of this battle. Let us find our resolve, and turnevents toward victory. We're carrying out a new strategy in Iraq -- a plan that demands more from Iraq's elected government, and gives our forces in Iraq the reinforcements they need to complete their mission. Our goal is a democratic Iraq that upholds the rule of law, respects the rights of itspeople, provides them security, and is an ally in the war on terror. In order to make progress toward this goal, the Iraqi government must stop the sectarian violence in its capital. But the Iraqis are not yet ready to do this on their own. So we're deploying reinforcements of more than 20,000 additional soldiers and Marines to Iraq. The vast majority will go to Baghdad, where they will help Iraqi forces to clear and secure neighborhoods, and serve as advisers embedded in Iraqi Army units. With Iraqis in the lead, our forces will help secure the city by chasing down the terrorists, insurgents, and the roaming death squads. And in Anbar Province, where al Qaeda terrorists have gathered and local forces have begun showing a willingness to fight them, we're sending an additional 4,000 United States Marines, with orders to find the terrorists and clear them out. We didn't drive al Qaeda out of their safe haven in Afghanistan only to let them set up a new safe haven in afree Iraq. The people of Iraq want to live in peace, and now it's time for their government to act. Iraq's leaders know that our commitment is not open-ended. They have promised to deploy more of their own troops to secure Baghdad -- and they must do so. They pledged that they will confront violent radicals of any faction or political party -- and they need to follow through, and lift needless restrictions on Iraqi and coalition forces, so these troops can achieve their mission of bringing security to all of the people of Baghdad. Iraq's leaders have committed themselves to a series of benchmarks -- to achieve reconciliation, to share oil revenues among all of Iraq's citizens, to put the wealth of Iraq into the rebuilding of Iraq, to allow more Iraqis to re-enter their nation's civic life, to hold local elections, and to take responsibility for security in every Iraqi province. But for all of this to happen, Baghdad must be secure. And our plan will help the Iraqi government take back its capital and make good on itscommitments. My fellow citizens, our military commanders and I have carefully weighed the options. We discussed every possible approach. In the end, I chose this course of action because it provides the best chance for success. Many in this chamber understand that America must not fail in Iraq, because you understand that the consequences of failure would be grievous andfar-reaching. If American forces step back before Baghdad is secure, the Iraqi government would be overrun by extremists on all sides. We could expect an epic battle between Shia extremists backed by Iran, and Sunni extremists aided by al Qaeda and supporters of the old regime. A contagion of violence could spill out across the country -- and in time, the entire region couldbe drawn into the conflict. For America, this is a nightmare scenario. For the enemy, this is the objective. Chaos is the greatest ally -- their greatest ally in this struggle. And out of chaos in Iraq would emerge an emboldened enemy with new safe havens, new recruits, new resources, and an even greater determination to harm America. To allow this to happen would be to ignore the lessons of September the 11th and invite tragedy. Ladies and gentlemen, nothing is more important at this moment in our history than for America to succeed in the Middle East, to succeed in Iraqand to spare the American people from this danger. This is where matters stand tonight, in the here and now. I have spoken with many of you in person. I respect you and the arguments you've made. We went into this largely united, in our assumptions and in our convictions. And whatever you voted for, you did not vote for failure. Our country is pursuing a new strategy in Iraq, and I ask you to give it a chance to work. AndI ask you to support our troops in the field, and those on their way. The war on terror we fight today is a generational struggle that will continue long after you and I have turned our duties over to others. And that's why it's important to work together so our nation can see this great effort through. Both parties and both branches should work in close consultation. It's why I propose to establish a special advisory council on the war on terror, made up of leaders in Congress from both political parties. We will share ideas for how to position America to meet every challenge that confronts us. We'll show our enemies abroadthat we are united in the goal of victory. And one of the first steps we can take together is to add to the ranks of our military so that the American Armed Forces are ready for all the challenges ahead. Tonight I ask the Congress to authorize an increase in the size of our active Army and Marine Corps by 92,000 in the next five years. A second task we can take on together is to design and establish a volunteer Civilian Reserve Corps. Such a corps would function much like our military reserve. It would ease the burden on the Armed Forces by allowing us to hire civilians with critical skills to serve on missions abroad when America needs them. It would give people across Americawho do not wear the uniform a chance to serve in the defining struggle of our time. Americans can have confidence in the outcome of this struggle because we're not in this struggle alone. We have a diplomatic strategy that is rallying the world to join in the fight against extremism. In Iraq, multinational forces are operating under a mandate from the United Nations. We're working with Jordan and Saudi Arabia and Egypt and the Gulf States toincrease support for Iraq's government. The United Nations has imposed sanctions on Iran, and made it clear that the world will not allow the regime in Tehran to acquire nuclear weapons. With the other members of the Quartet -- the U.N., the European Union, and Russia -- we're pursuing diplomacy to help bring peace to the Holy Land, and pursuing the establishment of a democratic Palestinian state living side-by-side with Israel in peace and security. In Afghanistan, NATO has taken the lead in turning back the Taliban and al Qaeda offensive -- the first time the Alliance has deployed forces outside the North Atlantic area. Together with our partners in China, Japan, Russia, and South Korea, we're pursuing intensive diplomacy to achieve a Korean Peninsula free of nuclearweapons. We will continue to speak out for the cause of freedom in places like Cuba, Belarus, andBurma -- and continue to awaken the conscience of the world to save the people of Darfur. American foreign policy is more than a matter of war and diplomacy. Our work in the world is also based on a timeless truth: To whom much is given, much is required. We hear the call to take on the challenges of hunger and poverty and disease -- and that is precisely what America is doing. We must continue to fight HIV/AIDS, especially on the continent of Africa. Because you funded our Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the number of people receiving life- saving drugs has grown from 50,000 to more than 800,000 in three short years. I ask you to continue funding our efforts to fight HIV/AIDS. I ask you to provide $1.2 billion over five yearsso we can combat malaria in 15 African countries. I ask that you fund the Millennium Challenge Account, so that American aid reaches the people who need it, in nations where democracy is on the rise and corruption is in retreat. And let us continue to support the expanded trade and debt relief that are the best hope forlifting lives and eliminating poverty. When America serves others in this way, we show the strength and generosity of our country. These deeds reflect the character of our people. The greatest strength we have is the heroic kindness, courage, and self-sacrifice of the American people. You see this spirit often if youknow where to look -- and tonight we need only look above to the gallery. Dikembe Mutombo grew up in Africa, amid great poverty and disease. He came to Georgetown University on a scholarship to study medicine -- but Coach John Thompson got a look at Dikembe and had a different idea. Dikembe became a star in the NBA, and a citizen of the United States. But he never forgot the land of his birth, or the duty to share his blessings with others. He built a brand new hospital in his old hometown. A friend has said of this good- hearted man: ""Mutombo believes that God has given him this opportunity to do great things.""And we are proud to call this son of the Congo a citizen of the United States of America. After her daughter was born, Julie Aigner-Clark searched for ways to share her love of music and art with her child. So she borrowed some equipment, and began filming children's videos in her basement. The Baby Einstein Company was born, and in just five years her business grew to more than $20 million in sales. In November 2001, Julie sold Baby Einstein to the Walt Disney Company, and with her help Baby Einstein has grown into a $200 million business. Julie represents the great enterprising spirit of America. And she is using her success to help others -- producing child safety videos with John Walsh of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Julie says of her new project: ""I believe it's the most important thing that I have ever done. I believe that children have the right to live in a world that is safe."" And so tonight, we are pleased to welcome this talented business entrepreneurand generous social entrepreneur -- Julie Aigner-Clark. Three weeks ago, Wesley Autrey was waiting at a Harlem subway station with his two little girls, when he saw a man fall into the path of a train. With seconds to act, Wesley jumped onto the tracks, pulled the man into the space between the rails, and held him as the train passed right above their heads. He insists he's not a hero. He says: ""We got guys and girls overseas dying for us to have our freedoms. We have got to show each other some love."" There is something wonderful about a country that produces a brave and humble man likeWesley Autrey. Tommy Rieman was a teenager pumping gas in Independence, Kentucky, when he enlisted in the United States Army. In December 2003, he was on a reconnaissance mission in Iraq when his team came under heavy enemy fire. From his Humvee, Sergeant Rieman returned fire; he used his body as a shield to protect his gunner. He was shot in the chest and arm, and received shrapnel wounds to his legs -- yet he refused medical attention, and stayed in the fight. He helped to repel a second attack, firing grenades at the enemy's position. For his exceptional courage, Sergeant Rieman was awarded the Silver Star. And like so many other Americans who have volunteered to defend us, he has earned the respect and the gratitude ofour entire country. In such courage and compassion, ladies and gentlemen, we see the spirit and character of America -- and these qualities are not in short supply. This is a decent and honorable country -- and resilient, too. We've been through a lot together. We've met challenges and faced dangers, and we know that more lie ahead. Yet we can go forward with confidence -- because the State of our Union is strong, our cause in the world is right, and tonight that cause goeson. God bless. See you next year. Thank you for your prayers.",bush
"Governor, thank you. President Steger, thank you very much. Students, and faculty, and staff,and grieving family members, and members of this really extraordinary place. Laura and I have come to Blacksburg today with hearts full of sorrow. This is a day of mourning for the Virginia Tech community -- and it is a day of sadness for our entire nation. We've come to express our sympathy. In this time of anguish, I hope you know that people all over this country are thinking about you, and asking God to provide comfort for all who havebeen affected. Yesterday began like any other day. Students woke up, and they grabbed their backpacks and they headed for class. And soon the day took a dark turn, with students and faculty barricading themselves in classrooms and dormitories -- confused, terrified, and deeply worried. By the end of the morning, it was the worst day of violence on a college campus inAmerican history -- and for many of you here today, it was the worst day of your lives. It's impossible to make sense of such violence and suffering. Those whose lives were taken did nothing to deserve their fate. They were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. Now they're gone -- and they leave behind grieving families, and grieving classmates, and agrieving nation. In such times as this, we look for sources of strength to sustain us. And in this moment of loss, you're finding these sources everywhere around you. These sources of strength are in this community, this college community. You have a compassionate and resilient community here at Virginia Tech. Even as yesterday's events were still unfolding, members of this community found each other; you came together in dorm rooms and dining halls and onblogs. One recent graduate wrote this: I don't know most of you guys, but we're all Hokies, which means we're family. To all of you who are okay, I'm happy for that. For those of you who are in pain or have lost someone close to you, I'm sure you can call on anyone of us and have help any timeyou need it. These sources of strength are with your loved ones. For many of you, your first instinct was to call home and let your moms and dads know that you were okay. Others took on the terrible duty of calling the relatives of a classmate or a colleague who had been wounded or lost. I know many of you feel awfully far away from people you lean on, people you count on during difficult times. But as a dad, I can assure you, a parent's love is never far from their child's heart. And as you draw closer to your own families in the coming days, I ask you to reach outto those who ache for sons and daughters who will never come home. These sources of strength are also in the faith that sustains so many of us. Across the town of Blacksburg and in towns all across America, houses of worship from every faith have opened their doors and have lifted you up in prayer. People who have never met you are praying for you; they're praying for your friends who have fallen and who are injured. There's a power in these prayers, real power. In times like this, we can find comfort in the grace and guidance of a loving God. As the Scriptures tells us, ""Don't be overcome by evil, but overcome evil withgood.""   And on this terrible day of mourning, it's hard to imagine that time will come when life at Virginia Tech will return to normal. But such a day will come. And when it does, you will always remember the friends and teachers who were lost yesterday, and the time you sharedwith them, and the lives they hoped to lead. May God bless you. May God bless and keep the souls of the lost. And may His love touch all those who suffer in grief.    Romans 12:21 (World English Bible)",bush
"United States of America, I welcome you in Ramallah, as well as in Bethlehem, on the land of Palestine, that welcomes you today as a great guest, that goes with him, commitment towards the peace process. It's a historic visit that gives our people great hope in the fact that your great nation is standing and supporting their dream and their yearning towards freedomand independence and living in peace in this area, alongside their neighbors. Our people will not forget Your Excellency, your invitation and your commitment towards the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. You are the first American President thatconfirms and reiterates this right. [Translation earpiece not working.] President Bush: I haven't got it yet. You may have to start over. Not yet. You better stayawake. President Abbas: Our people, Your Excellency -- President Bush: I agree completely. President Abbas: Your commitment towards an establishment of an independent Palestinian state -- you are the first American President to reiterate this right. The conferences of Annapolis and Paris were an historic step from you and from the American people and theworld as a whole to perfect this commitment and push it forward. Our Palestinian people, who committed to peace as a strategic option, want to see, through your support and your intervention, and end to its suffering and the suffering of its people and their families, and wants to move freely in their homeland, and develop their life and their economy without any obstacles that hinder that progress, and without a separation wall that fragments the land, and without settlements that is governing its land and future. We want to see a different future where prisons are not crowded with thousands of prisoners, and where hospitals are not crowded with tens of innocent victims every day, without checkpoints andqueues of ordinary people who suffer from humiliation and siege. I would like to point out here that we instructed our government to continue the work towards enhancing security and imposing public order, and establishing good governance that is based on the rule of law, and to consolidate the role of our democratic institutions and strengthen the work of the civil society, as well as work on consolidating development and administrative and financial reform and transparency, so that we can lay the foundations for a modern anddemocratic state. And the government is taking intensive steps in that direction, and I would like to express our appreciation for the support of your administration in the economic sphere in order to develop the infrastructure and provide new job opportunities, and improve the level of services and allother projects that contribute in improving the lives and the conditions of living for our people. We and our Israeli neighbors, and under your direct sponsorship -- bilateral negotiations that address all issues of final status are core issues -- that we would like to end these negotiations during your term in office and that we -- it will be ending by the -- ending of the occupation that started in 1967, and that establishment of an independent Palestinian state, and its capital, Jerusalem, based on your vision and the international resolutions, and that we find a fair solution for the tragedy of refugees, according to the Arab initiative for peace andaccording to the U.N. resolutions. And on this occasion I would like to reiterate before you our commitment to all our obligations that we agreed to. And we call upon Israel, as well, to fulfill its commitments according to the road map plan, because we firmly believe that peace is made by a will and a sharedcommitment among all parties. Your historic visit today to the Palestinian Territories is highly appreciated by our people, and it's a new expression of your deep commitment towards establishing peace on the land of peace. We appreciate the complete seriousness that characterizes your visit and your efforts today to continue and build and capitalize on this important opportunity that is available to usand to the Israelis. We start with you a new year, hoping that this will be the year for the creation of peace. You will hear today in Bethlehem the call for prayers from the mosques, and the heralding of bells at the Church of Nativity, that confirms our common message, the message of human tolerance and real peace that is deeply rooted in our conscience and in our heritage. Your presence today amongst us, Your Excellency, is a reiteration for the call for comprehensive and just peace that you called for and you committed yourself to. And the echo of this call reaches all the people and the countries in our region, because the voice that is now going out of Palestine is the closest and the deepest in reaching the hearts of all the people in theregion. Please, Your Excellency, trust that peace in the world starts from here, from the Holy Land.We welcome you again, our dear guest and our dear friend, here in Palestine. President Bush: Mr. President, thank you for your hospitality. We have met a lot in the pastand I'm glad to finally have a chance to sit down in your office to discuss important issues. [Interruption in the translation audio.] Is it working? Listen, they say I have enough problemsspeaking English as it is. I have had numerous opportunities to visit with the President. And the fundamental question I have is whether or not he is committed to peace. It's the same question I had for the Prime Minister of Israel. And I've come to the conclusion that both men understand the importanceto democratic states living side by side in peace. President Abbas was elected on a platform of peace. In other words, he just wasn't somebody who starts talking about it lately, he campaigned on it. He also said that if you give me a chance, I'll work to improve the lives of the average Palestinians, and that's what he has done. It's certainly not easy work. The conditions on the ground are very difficult and, nevertheless, this man and his government not only works for a vision, but also works to improve the lives of the average citizens, which is essential for the emergence of a Palestiniandemocracy. I talked to him today about how -- what we can do to help and, as he mentioned, the United States has been an active financial giver, we helped at the Paris Conference. I firmly believe that the Palestinians are entrepreneurial people who, if just given a chance, will be able togrow their businesses and provide jobs. We talked about the need to fight off the extremists. The world in which we live is a dangerous world because there are people who murder innocent people to achieve political objectives, not just here in this immediate part of the world, but around the world. That's what we're dealing with in Iraq and Afghanistan and Lebanon. And the fundamental question is, will nations stand up and help those who understand the ideological struggle we're in. And the President understands the ideological struggle. He knows that a handful of people want todash the aspirations of the Palestinian people by creating chaos and violence. And I appreciate that, Mr. President. And I appreciate your understanding that, ultimately, theway to achieve peace is to offer an alternative vision, and that's a vision based upon liberty. Now, look, there are some in the world who don't believe in the universality of freedom. I understand that. They say, like, freedom is okay for some of us, but maybe not all of us. I understand it, but I reject it. I believe in the universality of freedom. I believe, deep in the soul of every man, woman, and child on the face of this Earth is the desire to live in a free society. And I also believe free societies yield peace. And, therefore, this notion of two states living side by side in peace is based upon the universality of freedom, and if given a chance,the Palestinian people will work for freedom. And that's a challenge ahead of us -- is, is it possible for the Israelis and the Palestinians to work out their differences on core issues so that a vision can emerge? And my answer is, absolutely, it's possible. Not only is it possible, it's necessary. And I'm looking forward tohelping. You know, there's a great anticipation that all the American President has got to do is step in, and just say, okay, this is the way it's going to be. That's not how the system works. In order for there to be lasting peace, President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert have to come together and make tough choices. And I'm convinced they will. And I believe it's possible -- not only possible, I believe it's going to happen, that there will be a signed peace treaty by the time I leave office. That's what I believe. And the reason I believe that is because I hear the urgency in the voice of both the Prime Minister of Israel and the President of thePalestinian Authority. Is it going to be hard work? You bet. And we can help support these negotiations, and will. I was asked yesterday at a press conference, you know, what do you intend to do; if you're not going to write the agreement, what do you intend to do? I said, nudge the process forward -- like, pressure; be a pain if I need to be a pain -- which in some people's mind isn't all that hard. And they said, well, like -- yesterday, somebody said, well, are you disappointed? I arrived and it nudged the process forward. In other words, we can help influence the process, and will. But the only lasting peace will be achieved when the duly elected leaders ofthe respective peoples do the hard work. And so I want to help. And I want to help in the region, as well, Mr. President. The rest of my trip will be talking about, obviously, security threats, but also the opportunity to achieve peace. And the Arab world has got an opportunity and obligation, in my judgment, to helpboth parties in these negotiations move the process forward. I explained yesterday, and I just want to explain again today, there are three tracks to this process, as far as we're concerned. One is the negotiations to define a vision that will besubject to the road map. Secondly is to resolve -- help resolve road map issues. And today I introduced the President to the General -- three-star Air Force General who will be running this process. We have agreed to a trilateral process and want to help the Israelis and the Palestinians resolve theirdifferences over road map issues. And thirdly is to help the Palestinians develop the infrastructure necessary for a democracy -- an economy -- and security forces that are capable of doing what the President and the Prime Minister want to have done. And we're very much engaged. I'm looking forward to seeing Tony Blair tomorrow, who is the Quartet's representative, and to find out what he has beendoing and what progress is being made. I am confident that with proper help, the state of Palestine will emerge. And I'm confident that when it emerges it will be a major step towards peace. I am confident that the status quo is unacceptable, Mr. President, and we want to help you. And I appreciate your vision, and I appreciate your courage, and I appreciate your hospitality. And I appreciate you giving me achance to talk to the press, of course. A couple of questions, I understand. Question: Mr. President Abu Mazen, what are the results of this visit? Mr. President Bush, you said more than once that the Palestinian side must fulfill its obligations. And Mr. Fayyad has had a security plan to help the peace. And when Mr. Fayyad went to Annapolis he commended that security plan, and then Israel destroyed all those efforts in Annapolis. How can the Palestinian Authority do security efforts that are successful, and while Israel destroysand undermines all their efforts in the occupied territories? The other side of the question: Are you willing to give guarantees for the Palestinian side todeclaring a freezing on settlements immediately? Thank you. President Abbas: [As translated.] We are fully satisfied with the outcome that we reached through this visit of Mr. President George Bush. We spoke about all topics that might occur to your mind and that might not occur to your mind, as well. All the issues are in agreement. Weare agreed on all topics. All topics are clear. In the near future, in the coming few days, we are going to meet in bilateral negotiations with the Israelis in order to discuss the final status negotiations, final status issues. And as Mr. President said, there are three themes -- the other theme is implementing the road map through the committee, the trilateral committee. And the third point is the economic and security conditions in Palestinian Territories. We have great hopes that during 2008 we willreach the final status and a peace treaty with Israel. President Bush: Each side has got obligations under the road map. Settlements are clearly stated in the road map obligations for Israel. We have made our concerns about expansion ofsettlements known, and we expect both parties to honor their obligations under the road map. Secondly, we're spending -- General Dayton is spending a lot of time trying to help the President and the Prime Minister develop security forces that are effective. There's no question in my mind the commitment to provide security for the average citizen is strong. The question is the capabilities. And the truth of the matter is there needs to be a fair amount of work done to make sure that the security forces are modernized, well-trained and prepared, with a proper chain ofcommand to respond. And I will tell you I firmly believe the security forces are improving. I remember our visit in New York, and we discussed this during the U.N. General Assembly. And by any objective measurement, the Palestinian security forces in the West Bank areimproving. And so my message to the Israelis is that they ought to help, not hinder, the modernization of the Palestinian security force. It's in their interests that a government dedicated to peace andunderstanding the need for two states to live side by side in peace have a modern force. It's got -- very important for the government to be able to assure people that if there is a need, there will be an effective force to provide security. That's just step one of having credibility with the people. And to the extent that Israeli actions have undermined the effectiveness of the Palestinian force, or the authority of the state relative to the averagecitizen, is something that we don't agree with and have made our position clear. She just called on you. Question: -- [inaudible] -- President Bush: No, that's the road map obligation I was talking about. Question: -- [inaudible] -- President Bush: Yes. He's asking me about the checkpoints I drove through and my impression about what it was like to drive through checkpoints. I can understand why the Palestinians are frustrated driving through checkpoints. I can also understand that until confidence is gained on both sides, why the Israelis would want there to be a sense of security. In other words, they don't want a state on their border from which attacks would be launched. I can understand that. Any reasonable person can understand that. Why would you work tohave a state on your border if you weren't confident they'd be a partner in peace? And so checkpoints create frustrations for people. They create a sense of security for Israel; they create massive frustrations for the Palestinians. You'll be happy to hear that my motorcade of a mere 45 cars was able to make it through without being stopped. But I'm not so exactly sure that's what happens to the average person. And so the whole object is to create a state that is capable of defending itself internally, and giving confidence to itsneighbor that checkpoints won't be needed. Now, the vision of the Palestinian state is one of contiguous territory. In other words, as I said earlier in my administration, I said, Swiss cheese isn't going to work when it comes to the outline of a state. And I mean that. There is no way that this good man can assure the Palestinians of a hopeful future if there's not contiguous territory. And we -- that position is abundantly clear to both sides. Therefore, the ultimate vision, of course, is there be nocheckpoints throughout the Palestinian state-to-be. And, you know, this is the issue. We're working through how to gain enough confidence on both sides so that checkpoints won't be necessary, and a state can emerge. My judgment is, I can understand frustrations. I mean, I hear it a lot. I heard it -- you know, the chief negotiator spent two hours at a checkpoint. All he was trying to do was go negotiate. And I can see that -- I can see the frustrations. Look, I also understand that people in Israel -- and the truth of the matter is, in the Palestinian Territories -- the average citizen wants to knowwhether or not there's going to be protection from the violent few who murder. The security of a state is essential, particularly in a day and age when people simply disregard the value of human life, and kill. And so these checkpoints reflect the reality. And what we're trying to do is alter the reality by laying out a vision that is much more hopeful than thestatus quo. Question: Mr. President George Bush -- you launched war against Iraq after the Iraqi leadership refused to implement the United Nations resolutions. My question now is, what is the problem to ask Israel just to accept and to respect the United Nations resolutions relating to the Palestinian problem, which -- facilitating the achievement of ending the Israeli occupation to the Arab territories and facilitating also the solution between Palestinians andthe Israelis? And for Mahmoud Abbas, did you ask President George Bush to ask Israel to freezesettlements fully in order to enable negotiations from success? President Bush: Yes, but tell me the part about the U.N. thing again? What were you -- Icouldn't understand you very well. Question: I just asked why you ask Israel to accept the United Nations resolutions related tothe Palestinian problem, just to facilitate the solution, and to end the occupation. President Bush: Actually, I'm asking Israel to negotiate in good faith with an elected leader of the Palestinian Territory to come up with a permanent solution that -- look, the U.N. deal didn't work in the past. And so now we're going to have an opportunity to redefine the future by having a state negotiated between an elected leader of the Palestinian people, as well as the Prime Minister of Israel. This is an opportunity to move forward. And the only way for -- the only way to defeat the terrorists in the long run is to offer an alternative vision that ismore hopeful. And that's what we're attempting to do, sir. We can stay stuck in the past, which will yield nothing good for the Palestinians, in my judgment. We can chart a hopeful future, and that's exactly what this process is intending todo; to redefine the future for the Palestinian citizens and the Israelis. I'm confident that two democratic states living side by side in peace is in the interests not only of the Palestinians and the Israelis, but of the world. The question is whether or not the hard issues can be resolved and the vision emerges, so that the choice is clear amongst the Palestinians -- the choice being, do you want this state, or do you want the status quo? Do you want a future based upon a democratic state, or do you want the same old stuff? And that's a choice that I'm confident that if the Palestinian people are given, they will choosepeace. And so that's what we're trying to do, sir. President Abbas: [As translated.] The settlement for us is considered an obstacle for negotiations, and we have spoke more than once with Mr. Prime Minister Olmert, very frankly. And we also spoke in this meeting with President George Bush, and consequently, the President understood this issue. And we have heard the statements given by the Secretary ofState, Dr. Rice, and she has -- her point of view regarding settlements was very positive. Question: President Bush, Prime Minister Olmert said that peace is not alive here as long as Gaza militants continue their threats on Israel. How do you see, President, about --[inaudible] -- from Gaza? And for you, President Abbas, how do you intend, actually, to get control of Gaza, and do youthink this is possible by the end of the year and by the end of Mr. Bush's presidency? President Bush: First of all, Gaza is a tough situation. I don't know whether you can solve it in a year, or not. But I know this: It can't be solved unless the Prime Minister -- the President has a vision that he can lay out to the people of Gaza that says, here's your choice: Do you want those who have created chaos to run your country, or do you want those of us whonegotiated a settlement with the Israelis that will lead to lasting peace? There is a competing vision taking place in Gaza. And in my judgment, Hamas, which I felt ran on a campaign of, we're going to improve your lives through better education and better health, have delivered nothing but misery. And I'm convinced his government will yield a hopeful future. And the best way to make that abundantly clear is for there to be a visionthat's understandable. See, the past has just been empty words, you know. We -- actually it hasn't been that much - - I'm the only President that's really articulated a two-state solution so far -- but saying two states really doesn't have much bearing until borders are defined, right of return issues resolved, Jerusalem is understood, security measures -- the common security measures will be in place. That's what I'm talking about. I'm talking about a clear, defined state aroundwhich people can rally. And there's going to be -- there will be no better difference, a clear difference, than the vision of Hamas in Gaza and the vision of the President and the Prime Minister and his team based here in Ramallah. And to me, that's how you solve the issue in the long-term. And the definition of long-term, I don't know what it means. I'm not a timetable person -- actually, I am on a timetable -- got 12 months. But I'm impressed by the President's understanding about how a vision and a hopeful future will help clearly define the stakes amongst thePalestinian people. President Abbas: [As translated.] Gaza it is considered a coup by us, we consider it a coup d'etat what happened in Gaza. Now -- we consider it a coup d'etat. And we deal with Gaza at two levels. The first is that we deal with the people as part of us and we take full responsibility that is necessary towards our people. We spend in Gaza 58 percent of our budget. This is notto -- it is our duty towards our people that we provide them with all the need. As for the issue of Hamas, we said that this is a coup and they have to retreat from this coup and they have to recognize international legitimacy, all international legitimacy, and torecognize the Arab Initiative, as well. In this case we will have another talk. President Bush: Thank you, all. Thank you, all.",bush
"diplomatic corps, and distinguished guests: I am honored by the opportunity to stand on Arabsoil and speak to the people of this nation and this region. Throughout the sweep of history, the lands that the Arab people call home have played a pivotal role in world affairs. These lands sit at the juncture of three great continents -- Europe and Asia and Africa. These lands have given birth to three of the world's major religions. These lands have seen the rise and fall of great civilizations. And in the 21st century, theselands are once again playing a central role in the human story. A great new era is unfolding before us. This new era is founded on the equality of all people before God. This new era is being built with the understanding that power is a trust that must be exercised with the consent of the governed -- and deliver equal justice under the law. And this new era offers hope for the millions across the Middle East who yearn for a future ofpeace and progress and opportunity. Here in Abu Dhabi, we see clearly the outlines of this future. Beginning with the revered father of this country -- Sheikh Zayed -- you have succeeded in building a prosperous society out of the desert. You have opened your doors to the world economy. You have encouraged women to contribute to the development of your nation -- and they have occupied some of your highest ministerial posts. You have held historic elections for the Federal National Council. You have shown the world a model of a Muslim state that is tolerant toward people of other faiths. I'm proud to stand in a nation where the people have an opportunity to build a better futurefor themselves and their families. Thank you for your warm hospitality. In my country, we speak of these developments as the advance of freedom. Others may call it the advance of justice. Yet whatever term we use, the ideal is the same. In a free and just society, every person is treated with dignity. In a free and just society, leaders are accountable to those they govern. And in a free and just society, individuals can rise as far astheir talents and hard work will take them. For decades, the people of this region saw their desire for liberty and justice denied at home and dismissed abroad in the name of stability. Today your aspirations are threatened by violent extremists who murder the innocent in pursuit of power. These extremists have hijacked the noble religion of Islam, and seek to impose their totalitarian ideology on millions. They hate freedom and they hate democracy -- because it fosters religious tolerance and allows people to chart their own future. They hate your government because it does not share their dark vision. They hate the United States because they know we stand with you in opposition to their brutal ambitions. And everywhere they go, they use murder and fear tofoment instability to advance their aims. One cause of instability is the extremists supported and embodied by the regime that sits in Tehran. Iran is today the world's leading state sponsor of terror. It sends hundreds of millions of dollars to extremists around the world -- while its own people face repression and economic hardship at home. It undermines Lebanese hopes for peace by arming and aiding the terrorist group Hezbollah. It subverts the hopes for peace in other parts of the region by funding terrorist groups like Hamas and the Palestine Islamic Jihad. It sends arms to the Taliban in Afghanistan and Shia militants in Iraq. It seeks to intimidate its neighbors with ballistic missiles and bellicose rhetoric. And finally, it defies the United Nations and destabilizes the region by refusing to be open and transparent about its nuclear programs and ambitions. Iran's actions threaten the security of nations everywhere. So the United States is strengthening our longstanding security commitments with our friends in the Gulf -- and rallying friends around the world to confrontthis danger before it is too late. The other major cause of instability is the extremists embodied by al Qaeda and its affiliates. On September 11, 2001, al Qaeda murdered nearly 3,000 people on America's home soil. Some of the victims that day were innocent Muslims. And since then, al Qaeda and its allies have killed many more Muslims here in the Middle East -- including women and children. In Afghanistan under the Taliban, on Iraq's Anbar Province, they ruled by intimidation and murder. Their goal is to impose that same dark rule across the Middle East. So they seek to topple your governments, acquire weapons of mass destruction, and drive a wedge between the people of the United States and the people of the Middle East. And they will fail. The United States joins you in your commitment to the freedom and security of this region -- andwe will not abandon you to terrorists or extremists. The fight against the forces of extremism is the great ideological struggle of our time. And in this fight, our nations have a weapon more powerful than bombs or bullets. It is the desire for freedom and justice written into our hearts by Almighty God -- and no terrorist or tyrant can take that away. We see this desire in the 12 million Iraqis who dipped their fingers in purple ink as they voted in defiance of al Qaeda. We see the desire in the Palestinians who elected a President committed to peace and reconciliation. We see this desire in the thousands of Lebanese whose protests helped rid their country of a foreign occupier. And we see this desire in the brave dissidents and journalists who speak out against terror and oppression and injustice. We see this desire in the ordinary people across the Middle East, who are sick of violence, who are sick of corruption, sick of empty promises -- and who choose a free futurewhenever they are given a chance. We also see leaders across this region beginning to respond to the desires of their people -- and take the steps that will help enhance the stability and prosperity of their nations. The recent elections to your Federal National Council represent the first part of a larger reform designed to make your government more modern and more representative. Algeria held its first competitive presidential elections. Kuwait held elections in which women were allowed to vote and hold office for the first time. Citizens have voted in municipal elections in Saudi Arabia, in competitive parliamentary elections in Jordan and Morocco and Bahrain, and in a multiparty presidential election in Yemen. Across the world, the majority of Muslim people live in a free and democratic society - - and the people of the Middle East must continue to work for the day where that is also trueof the lands that Islam first called home. As freedom and justice advance in this part of the world, elections are important, but they're only a start. Free and just societies require strong civic institutions, such as houses of worship, universities, professional associations, local governments and community groups. Free and just societies require habits of self-government that contribute to the rule of law. And free and just societies ultimately depend on the emergence of an engaged public whose citizens feel they have a real stake in their nation's future. All these developments contributeto the bond between government and the governed, between a people and their nation. Free and just societies also create opportunities for their citizens. This opportunity begins with economic growth. In any society, the greatest resource is not the oil in the ground or the minerals beneath the soil. It is the skills and talents of the people. Or as one Nobel winning economist calls this human capital. Across this region, you have an abundance of human capital -- in the men and women who are your citizens. By strengthening your education systems and opening your economies, you will unlock their potential, create vibrant and entrepreneurial societies, and usher in a new era where people have confidence that tomorrowwill bring more opportunities than today. In the last few years, the nations of this region have made some great progress. The World Bank reports that economic growth is strong and it is rising. Saudi Arabia has joined the World Trade Organization. Jordan, Oman, Bahrain, and Morocco have signed free trade agreements with the United States. Your nations are attracting more foreign investment. Oil accounts for much of the economic growth here. But the nations of the Middle East are now investing in their people, and building infrastructure, and opening the door to foreign trade and investment. America supports you in these efforts. We believe that trade and investment is the key to the future of hope and opportunity. We also believe that as we demand you open your markets we should open ours, as well. We're encouraged by the movement towardeconomic freedom that we're seeing across the Middle East. Unfortunately, amid some steps forward in this region we've also seen some setbacks. You cannot build trust when you hold an election where opposition candidates find themselves harassed or in prison. You cannot expect people to believe in the promise of a better future when they are jailed for peacefully petitioning their government. And you cannot stand up amodern and confident nation when you do not allow people to voice their legitimate criticisms. The United States appreciates that democratic progress requires tough choices. Our own history teaches us that the road to freedom is not always even, and democracy does not come overnight. Yet we also know that for all the difficulties, a society based on liberty is worth the sacrifice. We know that democracy is the only form of government that treats individuals with the dignity and equality that is their right. We know from experience that democracy is the only system of government that yields lasting peace and stability. In a democracy, leaders depend on their people -- and most people do not want war and bloodshed and violence. Most people want lives of peace and opportunity. So it is the declared policy of the United States to support these peoples as they claim their freedom -- as a matter of natural right and nationalinterest. I recognize that some people -- including some in my own country -- believe it is a mistake to support democratic freedom in the Middle East. They say that the Arab people are not ""ready"" for democracy. Of course, that is exactly what people said about the Japanese after World War II. Some said that having an Emperor was incompatible with democracy. Some said that the Japanese religion was incompatible with democracy. Some said that advancing freedom in Japan and the Pacific was unwise, because our interests lay in supporting pro-Americanleaders no matter how they ruled their people. Fortunately, America rejected this advice, kept our faith in freedom, and stood with the people of Asia. The results are now in. Today the people of Japan have both a working democracy and a hereditary emperor. They have preserved their traditional religious practices while tolerating the faiths of others. They are surrounded by many democracies that reflect the full diversity of the region. Some of these democracies have constitutional monarchies, some have parliaments, and some have presidents. Some of these democracies have Christian majorities, some have Muslim majorities, some have Hindu or Buddhist majorities. Yet for all the differences, the free nations of Asia all derive their authority from the consent of the governed-- and all know the lasting stability that only freedom can bring. This transformation would not have been possible without America's presence and perseverance over many decades. And just as our commitment to Asia helped people there secure their freedom and prosperity, our commitment to the Middle East will help you achieve yours. And you can know from our record in Asia that our commitment is real, it is strong, andit is lasting. Today America is using its influence to foster peace and reconciliation in the Holy Land. The Israelis have raised a thriving modern society out of rocky soil, and want to live their lives in freedom and security at home and at peace with their neighbors. The Palestinian people aspire to build a nation of their own -- where they can live in dignity and realize their dreams. Today Israelis and Palestinians each understand that the only way to realize their own goals is by helping one another. In other words, an independent, viable, democratic, and peaceful Palestinian state is more than the dream of the Palestinians. It's also the best guarantee for peace for all its neighbors -- and the Israelis understand this. Leaders on both sides still have many tough decisions ahead, and they will need to back these decisions with real commitments. But the time has come for a Holy Land where Palestinian and Israeli livetogether in peace. America will do our part. In Annapolis in November, the United States invited the Israelis and the Palestinians, and other members of the international community to come to a conference. And I appreciate the fact that your country sent a delegate. It was a remarkable thing to see a Palestinian President and an Israeli Prime Minister address a roomful of Arab leaders together. And the result was that the Palestinians and Israelis launched negotiations for theestablishment of a Palestinian state and a broader peace. The talks are just beginning, and our hopes are high. At the beginning of my trip, I met with both Israeli and Palestinian leaders. I was impressed by their commitment to move forward. And by supporting the legitimate aspirations of both sides, we will encourage reconciliation between the Israeli and Palestinian people, foster reconciliation between Israelis and Arabs, and build a foundation for lasting peace that will contribute to the security of every state inthe Gulf. And as you build a Middle East growing in peace and prosperity, the United States will be your partner. As we have done in places from Asia to Europe, we have forged new relationships with friends and allies designed to help you protect your people and your borders. As we have done in places from Asia to Europe, we're helping you bring your economies into the global market. And as we have done in places from Asia to Europe, we have launched programs designed to help you promote economic reform and educational opportunity and politicalparticipation. The United States has no desire for territory. We seek our shared security in your liberty. We believe that stability can only come through a free and just Middle East -- where the extremists are marginalized by millions of moms and dads who want the same opportunitiesfor their children that we have for ours. So today I would like to speak directly to the people of the Middle East. To the Palestinian people: The dignity and sovereignty that is your right is within your reach. In President Abbas, you have a leader who understands that the path forward is through peaceful negotiations. Help him as he makes the tough decisions for peace. Oppose the extremists and terrorists who represent the greatest threat to a Palestinian state. The United States will help you build the institutions of democracy and prosperity -- and make yourdreams of a state come true. To the people of Israel: You know that peace and reconciliation with your neighbors is the best path to long-term security. We believe that peace is possible, though it requires tough decisions. The United States will always stand with Israel in the face of terrorism. And we will support you as you work to ensure the security of your people -- and bring peace andreconciliation to the Holy Land. To the people of Iraq: You have made your choice for democracy, and you have stood firm in face of terrible acts of murder. The terrorists and extremists cannot prevail. They are tormented by the sight of an old man voting, or a young girl going to school -- because they know a successful democracy is a mortal threat to their ambitions. The United States is fighting side by side with Sunni and Shia and Kurd to root out the terrorists and extremists. We have dealt them serious blows. The United States will continue to support you as you buildthe institutions of a free society. And together we'll defeat our common enemies. To the people of Iran: You are rich in culture and talent. You have a right to live under a government that listens to your wishes, respects your talents, and allows you to build better lives for your families. Unfortunately, your government denies you these opportunities, and threatens the peace and stability of your neighbors. So we call on the regime in Tehran to heed your will, and to make itself accountable to you. The day will come when the people of Iran have a government that embraces liberty and justice, and Iran joins the community of free nations. And when that good day comes, you will have no better friend than the UnitedStates of America. To the leaders across the Middle East who are fighting the extremists: The United States will stand with you as you confront the terrorists and radicals. We urge you to join us in committing the resources to help the Palestinians build the institutions of a free society. Help the citizens of Lebanon preserve their government and their sovereignty in the face of outside pressure from their neighbors. Show the Iraqis that you support them in their effort to build a more hopeful nation. And as you do these things, the best way to defeat the extremists in your midst is by opening your societies, and trusting in your people, and giving them a voicein their nation. And finally, to the people of the Middle East: We hear your cries for justice. We share your desire for a free and prosperous future. And as you struggle to find your voice and make yourway in this world, the United States will stand with you. For most of the world, there's no greater symbol of America than the Statue of Liberty. It was designed by a man who traveled widely in this part of the world -- and who had originally envisioned his woman bearing a torch as standing over the Suez Canal. Ultimately, of course, it was erected in New York Harbor, where it has been an inspiration to generations of immigrants. One of these immigrants was a poet-writer named Ameen Rihani. Gazing at her lamp held high, he wondered whether her sister might be erected in the lands of his Arabforefathers. Here is how he put it: ""When will you turn your face toward the East, oh Liberty?"" My friends, a future of liberty stands before you. It is your right. It is your dream. And it isyour destiny.",bush
"Over the past several months I've held a series of meetings with my economic team on the outlook for the U.S. economy. And before I left for the Middle East, I directed them to conduct a thorough assessment of our economic condition, consult with members of Congress, andprovide me with their recommendations about any actions we might need to take. The economic team reports that our economy has a solid foundation, but that there are areas of real concern. Our economy is still creating jobs, though at a reduced pace. Consumer spending is still growing, but the housing market is declining. Business investment andexports are still rising, but the cost of imported oil has increased. My administration has been watching our economy carefully. My advisors and many outside experts expect that our economy will continue to grow over the coming year, but at a slower rate than we have enjoyed for the past few years. And there is a risk of a downturn. Continued instability in the housing and financial markets could cause additional harm to ouroverall economy, and put our growth and job creation in jeopardy. In recent months, we've taken steps to shore up the housing market, including measures to help struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure and to keep their homes. I've also asked Congress to pass legislation to modernize the Federal Housing Administration and enable it to provide additional assistance to struggling homeowners. The House passed a bill and the Senate passed a bill, and now they need to get together and get a bill to my desk as quicklyas possible. After careful consideration, and after discussions with members of Congress, I have concluded that additional action is needed. To keep our economy growing and creating jobs, Congress and the administration need to work to enact an economic growth package as soon aspossible. As Congress considers such a plan, there are certain principles that must guide its deliberations: This growth package must be big enough to make a difference in an economy as large and dynamic as ours -- which means it should be about 1 percent of GDP. This growth package must be built on broad-based tax relief that will directly affect economic growth -- and not the kind of spending projects that would have little immediate impact on our economy. This growth package must be temporary and take effect right away -- so we can get help to our economy when it needs it most. And this growth package must not include anytax increases. Specifically, this growth package should bolster both business investment and consumer spending, which are critical to economic growth. And this would require two key provisions: To be effective, a growth package must include tax incentives for American businesses, including small businesses, to make major investments in their enterprises this year. Giving them an incentive to invest now will encourage business owners to expand theiroperations, create new jobs, and inject new energy into our economy in the process. To be effective, a growth package must also include direct and rapid income tax relief for the American people. Americans could use this money as they see fit -- to help meet their monthly bills, cover higher costs at the gas pump, or pay for other basic necessities. Letting Americans keep more of their own money should increase consumer spending, and lift oureconomy at a time when people otherwise might spend less. Yesterday, I spoke to members of the congressional leadership from both political parties. They shared with me their thoughts on the best way forward. And I was encouraged by those discussions and I believe there is enough broad consensus that we can come up with a package that can be approved with bipartisan support. I've asked Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson to lead my administration's efforts to forge an agreement with Congress, so that wecan deliver this needed boost to our economy as quickly as possible. Passing a new growth package is our most pressing economic priority. When that is done, Congress must turn to the most important economic priority for our country, and that's making sure the tax relief that is now in place is not taken away. A source of uncertainty in our economy is that this tax relief is set to expire at the end of 2010. Unless Congress acts, the American people will face massive tax increases in less than three years. The marriage penalty will make a comeback; the child tax credit will be cut in half; the death tax will come back to life; and tax rates will go up on regular income, capital gains, and dividends. This tax increase would put jobs and economic growth at risk, and Congress has a responsibility tokeep that from happening. So it's critical that Congress make this tax relief permanent. We're in the midst of a challenging period, and I know Americans are concerned about oureconomic future. But our economy has seen challenging times before -- and it is resilient. In a vibrant economy, markets rise and decline. We cannot change that fundamental dynamic. As a matter of fact, eliminating risk altogether would also eliminate the innovation and productivity that drives the creation of jobs and wealth in America. Yet there are also times when swift and temporary actions can help ensure that inevitable market adjustments do notundermine the health of the broader economy. This is such a moment. By passing an effective growth package quickly, we can provide a shot in the arm to keep a fundamentally strong economy healthy. And it will help keep economic sectors that are going through adjustments, such as the housing market, from adversely affecting other parts of oureconomy. I'm optimistic about our economic future, because Americans have shown time and again that they are the most industrious, creative, and enterprising people in the world. That is what hasmade our economy strong. That is what will make it stronger in the challenging times ahead. Thank you.",bush
"The issue of research involving stem cells derived from human embryos is increasingly the subject of a national debate and dinner table discussions. The issue is confronted every day in laboratories as scientists ponder the ethical ramifications of their work. It is agonized over by parents and many couples as they try to have children or to save children already born. The issue is debated within the church, with people of different faiths, even many of the samefaith, coming to different conclusions. Many people are finding that the more they know about stem cell research, the less certainthey are about the right ethical and moral conclusions. My administration must decide whether to allow federal funds, your tax dollars, to be used forscientific research on stem cells derived from human embryos. A large number of these embryos already exist. They are the product of a process called in vitro fertilization which helps so many couples conceive children. When doctors match sperm and egg to create life outside the womb, they usually produce more embryos than are implanted in the mother. Once a couple successfully has children or if they are unsuccessful, the additional embryos remain frozen in laboratories. Some will not survive during long storage, others are destroyed. A number have been donated to science and used to create privately funded stem cell lines. And a few have been implanted in anadoptive mother and born and are today healthy children. Based on preliminary work that has been privately funded, scientists believe further research using stem cells offers great promise that could help improve the lives of those who suffer from many terrible diseases, from juvenile diabetesto Alzheimer, from Parkinsons to spinal cord injuries. And while scientists admit they are not yet certain, they believe stem cellsderived from embryos have unique potential. You should also know that stem cells can be derived from sources other than embryos: from adult cells, from umbilical cords that are discarded after babies are born, from human placentas. And many scientists feel research on these types of stem cells is also promising. Many patients suffering from a range of diseases are already being helped with treatmentsdeveloped from adult stem cells. However, most scientists, at least today, believe that research on embryonic stem cells offers the most promise because these cells have the potential to develop in all of the tissues in thebody. Scientists further believe that rapid progress in this research will come only with federal funds. Federal dollars help attract the best and brightest scientists. They ensure new discoveries are widely shared at the largest number of research facilities, and that the research is directedtoward the greatest public good. The United States has a long and proud record of leading the world toward advances in science and medicine that improve human life, and the United States has a long and proud record of upholding the highest standards of ethics as we expand the limits of science andknowledge. Research on embryonic stem cells raises profound ethical questions, because extracting thestem cell destroys the embryo, and thus destroys its potential for life. Like a snowflake, each of these embryos is unique, with the unique genetic potential of anindividual human being. As I thought through this issue I kept returning to two fundamental questions. First, are these frozen embryos human life and therefore something precious to be protected? And second, if they're going to be destroyed anyway, shouldn't they be used for a greater good, for researchthat has the potential to save and improve other lives? I've asked those questions and others of scientists, scholars, bio-ethicists, religious leaders, doctors, researchers, members of Congress, my Cabinet and my friends. I have read heartfelt letters from many Americans. I have given this issue a great deal of thought, prayer, andconsiderable reflection, and I have found widespread disagreement. On the first issue, are these embryos human life? Well, one researcher told me he believes this five-day-old cluster of cells is not an embryo, not yet an individual but a pre-embryo. He argued that it has the potential for life, but it is not a life because it cannot develop on itsown. An ethicist dismissed that as a callous attempt at rationalization. ""Make no mistake,"" he told me, ""that cluster of cells is the same way you and I, and all the rest of us, started our lives. One goes with a heavy heart if we use these,"" he said, ""because we are dealing with the seedsof the next generation."" And to the other crucial question -- If these are going to be destroyed anyway, why not usethem for good purpose? -- I also found different answers. Many are these embryos are byproducts of a process that helps create life and we should allow couples to donate them to science so they can be used for good purpose instead of wasting their potential. Others will argue there is no such thing as excess life and the fact that a living being is goingto die does not justify experimenting on it or exploiting it as a natural resource. At its core, this issue forces us to confront fundamental questions about the beginnings of life and the ends of science. It lives at a difficult moral intersection, juxtaposing the need toprotect life in all its phases with the prospect of saving and improving life in all its stages. As the discoveries of modern science create tremendous hope, they also lay vast ethical minefields. As the genius of science extends the horizons of what we can do, we increasingly confront complex questions about what we should do. We have arrived at that brave new world that seemed so distant in 1932 when Alduous Huxley wrote about human beings created in testtubes in what he called a hatchery. In recent weeks, we learned that scientists have created human embryos in test tubes solely to experiment on them. This is deeply troubling and a warning sign that should prompt all ofus to think through these issues very carefully. Embryonic stem cell research is at the leading edge of a series of moral hazards. The initial stem cell researcher was at first reluctant to begin his research, fearing it might be used for human cloning. Scientists have already cloned a sheep. Researchers are telling us the next step could be to clone human beings to create individual designer stem cells, essentially togrow another you, to be available in case you need another heart or lung or liver. I strongly oppose human cloning, as do most Americans. We recoil at the idea of growinghuman beings for spare body parts or creating life for our convenience. And while we must devote enormous energy to conquering disease, it is equally important that we pay attention to the moral concerns raised by the new frontier of human embryo stemcell research. Even the most noble ends do not justify any means. My position on these issues is shaped by deeply held beliefs. I'm a strong supporter of science and technology, and believe they have the potential for incredible good -- to improve lives, to save life, to conquer disease. Research offers hope that millions of our loved ones may be cured of a disease and rid of their suffering. I have friends whose children suffer from juvenile diabetes. Nancy Reagan has written me about President Reagan's struggle with Alzheimer's. My own family has confronted the tragedy of childhood leukemia. And like all Americans, Ihave great hope for cures. I also believe human life is a sacred gift from our creator. I worry about a culture that devalues life, and believe as your president I have an important obligation to foster andencourage respect for life in America and throughout the world. And while we're all hopeful about the potential of this research, no one can be certain that thescience will live up to the hope it has generated. Eight years ago, scientists believed fetal tissue research offered great hope for cures and treatments, yet the progress to date has not lived up to its initial expectations. Embryonic stem cell research offers both great promise and great peril, so I have decided we mustproceed with great care. As a result of private research, more than 60 genetically diverse stem cell lines already exist. They were created from embryos that have already been destroyed, and they have the abilityto regenerate themselves indefinitely, creating ongoing opportunities for research. I have concluded that we should allow federal funds to be used for research on these existingstem cell lines, where the life-and- death decision has already been made. Leading scientists tell me research on these 60 lines has great promise that could lead to breakthrough therapies and cures. This allows us to explore the promise and potential of stem cell research without crossing a fundamental moral line by providing taxpayer funding that would sanction or encourage further destruction of human embryos that have at least the potentialfor life. I also believe that great scientific progress can be made through aggressive federal funding of research on umbilical cord, placenta, adult and animal stem cells, which do not involve the same moral dilemma. This year your government will spent $250 million on this importantresearch. I will also name a president's council to monitor stem cell research, to recommend appropriate guidelines and regulations and to consider all of the medical and ethical ramifications of bio- medical innovation. This council will consist of leading scientists, doctors, ethicists, lawyers, theologians and others, and will be chaired by Dr. Leon Cass, a leading bio-medical ethicist from the Universityof Chicago. This council will keep us apprised of new developments and give our nation a forum tocontinue to discuss and evaluate these important issues. As we go forward, I hope we will always be guided by both intellect and heart, by both ourcapabilities and our conscience. I have made this decision with great care, and I pray it is the right one. Thank you for listening. Good night, and God bless America.",bush
"Thank you all. Deputy Secretary England, thanks for the introduction. One boss may not be here, but the other one is. I appreciate your kind words. I'm pleased to be back here with themen and women of the Defense Department. On this day in 2003, the United States began Operation Iraqi Freedom. As the campaign unfolded, tens and thousands of our troops poured across the Iraqi border to liberate the Iraqipeople and remove a regime that threatened free nations. Five years into this battle, there is an understandable debate over whether the war was worth fighting, whether the fight is worth winning, and whether we can win it. The answers are clear to me: Removing Saddam Hussein from power was the right decision -- and this is a fightAmerica can and must win. The men and women who crossed into Iraq five years ago removed a tyrant, liberated a country, and rescued millions from unspeakable horrors. Some of those troops are with us today, and you need to know that the American people are proud of your accomplishment --and so is the Commander in Chief. I appreciate Admiral Mullen, the Joint Chiefs who are here. Thanks for coming. Secretary Donald Winter of the Navy. Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte is with us. Admiral Thad Allen of the Coast Guard is with us. Ambassador from Iraq is with us -- Mr. Ambassador, we're proud to have you here. Soldiers, Sailors, Marines, Airmen and Coastmen -- Coast Guardmen [sic], thanks for coming, thanks for wearing the uniform. Men and women of theDepartment of State are here as well. Operation Iraqi Freedom was a remarkable display of military effectiveness. Forces from the UK, Australia, Poland and other allies joined our troops in the initial operations. As they advanced, our troops fought their way through sand storms so intense that they blackened the daytime sky. Our troops engaged in pitched battles with the Fedayeen Saddam -- death squads acting on the orders of Saddam Hussein that obeyed neither the conventions of war nor the dictates of conscience. These death squads hid in schools and they hid in hospitals, hoping to draw fire against Iraqi civilians. They used women and children as human shields. They stopped at nothing in their efforts to prevent us from prevailing -- but they couldn't stopthe coalition advance. Aided by the most effective and precise air campaign in history, coalition forces raced across 350 miles of enemy territory -- destroying Republican Guard Divisions, pushing through the Karbala Gap, capturing Saddam International Airport, and liberating Baghdad in less than onemonth. Along the way, our troops added new chapters to the story of American military heroism. During these first weeks of battle, Army Sergeant First Class Paul Ray Smith and his troops came under a surprise attack by about a hundred Republican Guard forces. Sergeant Smith rallied his men; he led a counterattack -- killing as many as 50 enemy soldiers before being fatally wounded. His actions saved the lives of more than a hundredAmerican troops -- and earned him the Medal of Honor. Today, in light of the challenges we have faced in Iraq, some look back and call this period the easy part of the war. Yet there was nothing easy about it. The liberation of Iraq took incredible skill and amazing courage. And the speed, precision and brilliant execution of thecampaign will be studied by military historians for years to come. What our troops found in Iraq following Saddam's removal was horrifying. They uncovered children's prisons, and torture chambers, and rape rooms where Iraqi women were violated in front of their families. They found videos showing regime thugs mutilating Iraqis deemed disloyal to Saddam. And across the Iraqi countryside they uncovered mass graves ofthousands executed by the regime. Because we acted, Saddam Hussein no longer fills fields with the remains of innocent men, women and children. Because we acted, Saddam's torture chambers and rape rooms and children's prisons have been closed for good. Because we acted, Saddam's regime is no longer invading its neighbors or attacking them with chemical weapons and ballistic missiles. Because we acted, Saddam's regime is no longer paying the families of suicide bombers in the Holy Land. Because we acted, Saddam's regime is no longer shooting at American and British aircraft patrolling the no-fly zones and defying the will of the United Nations. Because weacted, the world is better and United States of America is safer. When the Iraqi regime was removed, it did not lay down its arms and surrender. Instead, former regime elements took off their uniforms and faded into the countryside to fight the emergence of a free Iraq. And then they were joined by foreign terrorists who were seeking to stop the advance of liberty in the Middle East and seeking to establish safe havens from whichto plot new attacks across the world. The battle in Iraq has been longer and harder and more costly than we anticipated -- but it is a fight we must win. So our troops have engaged these enemies with courage and determination. And as they've battled the terrorists and extremists in Iraq, they have helped the Iraqi people reclaim their nation, and helped a young democracy rise from the rubble ofSaddam Hussein's tyranny. Over the past five years, we have seen moments of triumph and moments of tragedy. We have watched in admiration as 12 million Iraqis defied the terrorists and went to the polls, and chose their leaders in free elections. We have watched in horror as al Qaeda beheaded innocent captives, and sent suicide bombers to blow up mosques and markets. These actions show the brutal nature of the enemy in Iraq. And they serve as a grim reminder: The terrorists who murder the innocent in the streets of Baghdad want to murder the innocent in the streets of America. Defeating this enemy in Iraq will make it less likely that we'll face theenemy here at home. A little over a year ago, the fight in Iraq was faltering. Extremist elements were succeeding in their efforts to plunge Iraq into chaos. They had established safe havens in many parts of the country. They were creating divisions among the Iraqis along sectarian lines. And their strategy of using violence in Iraq to cause divisions in America was working -- as pressuresbuilt here in Washington for withdrawal before the job was done. My Administration understood that America could not retreat in the face of terror. And we knew that if we did not act, the violence that had been consuming Iraq would worsen, and spread, and could eventually reach genocidal levels. Baghdad could have disintegrated into acontagion of killing, and Iraq could have descended into full-blown sectarian warfare. So we reviewed the strategy -- and changed course in Iraq. We sent reinforcements into the country in a dramatic policy shift that is now known as ""the surge."" General David Petraeus took command with a new mission: Work with Iraqi forces to protect the Iraqi people, pressure [sic] the enemy into strongholds, and deny the terrorists sanctuary anywhere in thecountry. And that is precisely what we have done. In Anbar, Sunni tribal leaders had grown tired of al Qaeda's brutality and started a popular uprising, called the ""Anbar Awakening."" To take advantage of this opportunity, we sent 4,000 additional Marines to help these brave Iraqis drive al Qaeda from the province. As this effort succeeded, it inspired other Iraqis to take up the fight. Soon similar uprisings began to spread across the country. Today there are more than 90,000 concerned local citizens who are protecting their communities from the terrorists and insurgents and the extremists. The government in Baghdad has stepped forward with a surge of its own -- they've added more than 100,000 new Iraqi soldiers and police during the past year. These Iraqi troops havefought bravely, and thousands have given their lives in this struggle. Together, these Americans and Iraqi forces have driven the terrorists from many of the sanctuaries they once held. Now the terrorists have gathered in and around the northern Iraqi city of Mosul -- and Iraqi and American forces are relentlessly pursuing them. There will be tough fighting in Mosul and areas of northern Iraq in the weeks ahead. But there's no doubt in my mind, because of the courage of our troops and the bravery of the Iraqis, the al Qaedaterrorists in this region will suffer the same fate as al Qaeda suffered elsewhere in Iraq. As we have fought al Qaeda, coalition and Iraqi forces have also taken the fight to Shia extremist groups -- many of them backed and financed and armed by Iran. A year ago these groups were on the rise. Today, they are increasingly isolated, and Iraqis of all faiths areputting their lives on the line to stop these extremists from hijacking their young democracy. To ensure that military progress in Iraq is quickly followed up with real improvements in daily life, we have doubled the number of provincial reconstruction teams in Iraq. These teams of civilian experts are serving all Iraqi -- 18 Iraqi provinces, and they're helping to strengthen responsible leaders, and build up local economies, and bring Iraqis together so that reconciliation can happen from the ground up. They're very effective. They're helping give ordinary Iraqis confidence that by rejecting the extremists and reconciling with one another,they can claim their place in a free Iraq -- and build better lives for their families. There's still hard work to be done in Iraq. The gains we have made are fragile and reversible. But on this anniversary, the American people should know that since the surge began, the level of violence is significantly down, civilian deaths are down, sectarian killings are down, attacks on American forces are down. We have captured or killed thousands of extremists in Iraq, including hundreds of key al Qaeda leaders and operatives. Our men and women in uniform are performing with characteristic honor and valor. The surge is working. And as areturn on our success in Iraq, we've begun bringing some of our troops home. The surge has done more than turn the situation in Iraq around -- it has opened the door to a major strategic victory in the broader war on terror. For the terrorists, Iraq was supposed to be the place where al Qaeda rallied Arab masses to drive America out. Instead, Iraq has become the place where Arabs joined with Americans to drive al Qaeda out. In Iraq, we are witnessing the first large-scale Arab uprising against Osama bin Laden, his grim ideology, andhis murderous network. And the significance of this development cannot be overstated. The terrorist movement feeds on a sense of inevitability, and claims to rise on the tide of history. The accomplishments of the surge in Iraq are exposing this myth and discrediting the extremists. When Iraqi and American forces finish the job, the effects will reverberate far beyond Iraq's borders. Osama bin Laden once said: ""When people see a strong horse and a weak horse, by nature they will like the strong horse."" By defeating al Qaeda in Iraq, we will show the world that al Qaeda is the weak horse. We will show that men and women who love liberty can defeat the terrorists. And we will show that the future of the Middle East does notbelong to terror -- the future of the Middle East belongs to freedom. The challenge in the period ahead is to consolidate the gains we have made and seal the extremists' defeat. We have learned through hard experience what happens when we pull our forces back too fast -- the terrorists and extremists step in, they fill vacuums, establish safe havens, and use them to spread chaos and carnage. General Petraeus has warned that too fast a drawdown could result in such an unraveling -- with al Qaeda and insurgents and militiaextremists regaining lost ground and increasing violence. Men and women of the Armed Forces: Having come so far, and achieved so much, we're notgoing to let this to happen. Next month, General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker will come to Washington to testify before Congress. I will await their recommendations before making decisions on our troop levels in Iraq. Any further drawdown will be based on conditions on the ground and the recommendations of our commanders -- and they must not jeopardize the hard-fought gainsour troops and civilians have made over the past year. The successes we are seeing in Iraq are undeniable -- yet some in Washington still call for retreat. War critics can no longer credibly argue that we're losing in Iraq -- so now they argue the war costs too much. In recent months we've heard exaggerated estimates of the costs of this war. No one would argue that this war has not come at a high cost in lives and treasure -- but those costs are necessary when we consider the cost of a strategic victory for our enemiesin Iraq. If we were to allow our enemies to prevail in Iraq, the violence that is now declining would accelerate -- and Iraq would descend into chaos. Al Qaeda would regain its lost sanctuaries and establish new ones -- fomenting violence and terror that could spread beyond Iraq'sborders, with serious consequences for the world's economy. Out of such chaos in Iraq, the terrorist movement could emerge emboldened -- with new recruits, new resources, and an even greater determination to dominate the region and harm America. An emboldened al Qaeda with access to Iraq's oil resources could pursue its ambitions to acquire weapons of mass destruction to attack America and other free nations. Iran would be emboldened as well -- with a renewed determination to develop nuclear weapons and impose its brand of hegemony across the Middle East. Our enemies would seean America -- an American failure in Iraq as evidence of weakness and a lack of resolve. To allow this to happen would be to ignore the lessons of September the 11th and make it more likely that America would suffer another attack like the one we experienced that day -- a day in which 19 armed men with box cutters killed nearly 3,000 people in our -- on our soil; a day after which in the following of that attack more than one million Americans lost work, lost their jobs. The terrorists intend even greater harm to our country. And we have no greater responsibility than to defeat our enemies across the world so that they cannot carry out suchan attack. As our coalition fights the enemy in Iraq, we've stayed on the offensive on other fronts in the war on terror. Just a few weeks before commencing Operation Iraqi Freedom, U.S. forces captured Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind behind the September the 11th terrorist attacks; we got him in Pakistan. About the same time as we launched Operation Iraqi Freedom, coalition forces, thousands of -- hundreds of miles away launched an assault on the terrorists in the mountains of southern Afghanistan in an operation called Operation ValiantStrike. Throughout the war on terror, we have brought the enemy -- we have fought the enemy on every single battlefront. And so long as the terrorist danger remains, the United States of America will continue to fight the enemy wherever it makes its stand. We will stay on theoffense. But in the long run, defeating the terrorists requires an alternative to their murderous ideology. And there we have another advantage -- we've got a singular advantage with our military when it comes to finding the terrorists and bringing them to justice. And we haveanother advantage in our strong belief in the transformative power of liberty. So we're helping the people of Iraq establish a democracy in the heart of the Middle East. A free Iraq will fight terrorists instead of harboring them. A free Iraq will be an example for others of the power of liberty to change the societies and to displace despair with hope. By spreading the hope of liberty in the Middle East, we will help free societies take root -- andwhen they do, freedom will yield the peace that we all desire. Our troops on the front lines understand what is at stake. They know that the mission in Iraq has been difficult and has been trying for our nation -- because they're the ones who've carried most of the burdens. They are all volunteers, who have stepped forward to defend America in a time of danger -- and some of them have gone out of their way to return to thefight. One of these brave Americans is a Marine Gunnery Sergeant named William ""Spanky"" Gibson. In May of 2006 in Ramadi, a terrorist sniper's bullet ripped through his left knee -- doctors then amputated his leg. After months of difficult rehabilitation, Spanky was not only walking --he was training for triathlons. Last year, at the ""Escape from Alcatraz"" swim near San Francisco, he met Marine General James Mattis, who asked if there's anything he could do for him. Spanky had just one request: He asked to re-deploy to Iraq. Today he's serving in Fallujah -- the first full-leg amputee to return to the front lines. Here's what he says about his decision to return: The Iraqis are where we were 232 years ago as a nation. Now they're starting a new nation, and that's one of my big reasons for coming back here. I wanted to tell the people of this countrythat I'm back to help wherever I can. When Americans like Spanky Gibson serve on our side, the enemy in Iraq doesn't got a chance. We're grateful to all the brave men and women of our military who have served the cause of freedom. You've done the hard work, far from home and from your loved ones. Wegive thanks for all our military families who love you and have supported you in this mission. We appreciate the fine civilians from many departments who serve alongside you. Many of you served in Iraq and Afghanistan -- and some have been on these fronts several times. You will never forget the people who fought at your side. You will always remember the comrades who served with you in combat [but] did not make the journey home. America remembers them as well. More than 4,400 men and women have given their lives in the war on terror.We'll pray for their families. We'll always honor their memory. The best way we can honor them is by making sure that their sacrifice was not in vain. Five years ago tonight, I promised the American people that in the struggle ahead ""we will accept no outcome but victory."" Today, standing before men and women who helped liberate a nation, I reaffirm the commitment. The battle in Iraq is noble, it is necessary, and it is just.And with your courage, the battle in Iraq will end in victory. God bless.",bush
"Holy Father, Laura and I are privileged to have you here at the White House. We welcome youwith the ancient words commended by Saint Augustine: ""Pax Tecum."" Peace be with you. You've chosen to visit America on your birthday. Well, birthdays are traditionally spent withclose friends, so our entire nation is moved and honored that you've decided to share thisspecial day with us. We wish you much health and happiness -- today and for many years tocome. This is your first trip to the United States since you ascended to the Chair of Saint Peter. Youwill visit two of our greatest cities and meet countless Americans, including many who havetraveled from across the country to see with you and to share in the joy of this visit. Here inAmerica you'll find a nation of prayer. Each day millions of our citizens approach our Maker onbended knee, seeking His grace and giving thanks for the many blessings He bestows uponus. Millions of Americans have been praying for your visit, and millions look forward to prayingwith you this week. Here in America you'll find a nation of compassion. Americans believe that the measure of afree society is how we treat the weakest and most vulnerable among us. So each day citizensacross America answer the universal call to feed the hungry and comfort the sick and care forthe infirm. Each day across the world the United States is working to eradicate disease,alleviate poverty, promote peace and bring the light of hope to places still mired in thedarkness of tyranny and despair. Here in America you'll find a nation that welcomes the role of faith in the public square. Whenour Founders declared our nation's independence, they rested their case on an appeal to the""laws of nature, and of nature's God."" We believe in religious liberty. We also believe that alove for freedom and a common moral law are written into every human heart, and that theseconstitute the firm foundation on which any successful free society must be built. Here in America, you'll find a nation that is fully modern, yet guided by ancient and eternaltruths. The United States is the most innovative, creative and dynamic country on earth -- itis also among the most religious. In our nation, faith and reason coexist in harmony. This isone of our country's greatest strengths, and one of the reasons that our land remains abeacon of hope and opportunity for millions across the world. Most of all, Holy Father, you will find in America people whose hearts are open to yourmessage of hope. And America and the world need this message. In a world where someinvoke the name of God to justify acts of terror and murder and hate, we need your messagethat ""God is love."" And embracing this love is the surest way to save men from ""falling prey tothe teaching of fanaticism and terrorism."" In a world where some treat life as something to be debased and discarded, we need yourmessage that all human life is sacred, and that ""each of us is willed, each of us is loved"" --and your message that ""each of us is willed, each of us is loved, and each of us is necessary."" In a world where some no longer believe that we can distinguish between simple right andwrong, we need your message to reject this ""dictatorship of relativism,"" and embrace aculture of justice and truth. In a world where some see freedom as simply the right to do as they wish, we need yourmessage that true liberty requires us to live our freedom not just for ourselves, but ""in a spiritof mutual support."" Holy Father, thank you for making this journey to America. Our nation welcomes you. Weappreciate the example you set for the world, and we ask that you always keep us in yourprayers.",bush
"I just signed a -- a bill passed by the leaders of the Senate and House who have joined me tohonor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi with the Congressional Gold Medal. This is a fitting tribute to a courageous woman who speaks for freedom for all the people of Burma, and who speaks in such a way that she's a powerful voice in contrast to the junta thatcurrently rules the country. Burma has been hit by a terrible natural disaster. Laura and I and members of the Senate andHouse here express our heartfelt sympathy to the people of Burma. The United States has made an initial aid contribution, but we want to do a lot more. We're prepared to move U.S. Navy assets to help find those who've lost their lives, to help find the missing, to help stabilize the situation. But in order to do so, the military junta must allow ourdisaster assessment teams into the country. So our message is to the military rulers: Let the United States come and help you, help thepeople. Our hearts go out to the people of Burma. We want to help them deal with this terribledisaster. At the same time, of course, we want them to live in a free society. I want to thank you for your leadership, thank you for your determination to send a messagethat America stands with this courageous woman. Thank you.",bush
"President Peres, thank you, sir, for your hospitality. Mr. Prime Minister and Mrs. Olmert, it's great to be with you. We consider you friends. Heads of state, thank you all for coming. I think it's a great tribute to this conference, as well as to Israel that so many heads of state have come. Ex-heads of state and ex-leaders, thanks for being here. Save a seat in the ex- leader's club. Citizens of Israel, Laura and I loved coming to your beautiful country, and thank you for your warm hospitality. Citizens of the United States, my fellow Americans: Spendfreely and behave yourselves. Distinguished guests, I really appreciate your warm welcome; and we are thrilled to be here with one of America's closest friends. Laura and I are honored to represent the Americanpeople on the 60th anniversary of your independence. Happy birthday. As we celebrate the anniversary, it is useful to look back at the story of your founding. It is a story of how faith guided the Jewish people through centuries of bitter exile. It is a story of how those living behind ghetto walls and barbed wire never lost sight of Jerusalem. It is a story of how brave pioneers risked everything to redeem the promise of this land. It is amarvelous story. When Israel's founders gathered in Tel Aviv to sign your declaration of independence, the threat of war loomed. But it could not overshadow the joy of people who had lived to see their prayers answered. Celebrations broke out all across this land, and of course they broke out in America, as well. In New York, young men and women danced the Hora in the streets. In Washington, a crowd gathered to watch a flag-raising ceremony outside the building that would become Israel's first embassy. After one man saw the flag bearing the Star of David, hesaid, ""I never thought I'd live to see this day."" Looking back 60 years later, it is important to remember what the founders of Israel had to overcome at every stage of the journey. They established one of the world's great democracies in a region where democracy had few roots. They formed a unified army out of immigrants and refugees from many different countries. They planted the seeds of a modern economy in the sands of an ancient desert. In these accomplishments, we see the visionary leadership of men and women like Herzl and Weizmann and Ben-Gurion and Golda Meir andRabin and Sharon -- and we honor each of them this evening. And looking back 60 years later, we've also got to remember the courage of President Harry S. Truman. As Israel prepared to declare independence, President Truman faced a tough choice over whether to recognize a new state. The future of Israel hung in the balance. As Chaim Weizmann told the President, he said, ""History and providence have placed this issue in your hands."" And today we know that the forces of Providence could not have chosen a betterman than America's 33rd President. Eleven minutes after Israel came into existence, the United States became the first nation to recognize its independence. And because Harry Truman did what was right instead of following the conventional wisdom, we can say today that America is Israel's oldest and bestfriend in the world. With every passing year, the bonds of friendship between America and Israel have grown stronger. America stands for peace, and so does Israel. And as we stand in peace, we must understand the realities of the world in which we live. We must be steadfast, and we must be strong in the face of those who murder the innocent to achieve their objectives. And in the long run, we share a powerful belief in a powerful weapon against the terrorists. We believe that the surest way to defeat the enemies of hatred is to advance the cause of hope to thecause of freedom -- liberty as the great alternative to tyranny and terror. Mr. President, and Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for inviting me to speak at the Knesset tomorrow. I hear it's a place of many a sharp elbow. I'm looking forward to giving my speech. I'm not going to be throwing any elbows. But I will talk about the day when I believe every child in the Middle East can live in peace and live in freedom. With trust in the Rock of Israel, we know that day will come. And when it does, the United States of Americawill be at your side. God bless Israel, and God bless America.",bush
"President Peres and Mr. Prime Minister, Madam Speaker, thank very much for hosting this special session. President Beinish, Leader of the Opposition, Netanyahu, Ministers, membersof the Knesset, distinguished guests: Shalom. Laura and I are thrilled to be back in Israel. We have been deeply moved by the celebrations of the past two days. And this afternoon, I'm honored to stand before one of the world's greatest democratic assemblies and convey the wishes of the American people with thesewords: Yom Ha'atzmaut Sameach.1 It is a -- It is a rare privilege -- It's a rare privilege for the American President to speak to the Knesset. Although the Prime Minister told me there's something even rarer -- to have just one person in this chamber speaking at a time. My only regret is that one of Israel's greatest leaders is not here to share this moment. He's a warrior for the ages, a man of peace, afriend. The prayers of the American people are with Ariel Sharon. We gather to mark a momentous occasion. Sixty years ago in Tel Aviv, David Ben-Gurion proclaimed Israel's independence, founded on the ""natural right of the Jewish people to be masters of their own fate."" What followed was more than the establishment of a new country. It was the redemption of an ancient promise given to Abraham and Moses and David -- ahomeland for the chosen people Eretz Yisrael.2 Eleven minutes later, on the orders of President Harry Truman, the United States was proud to be the first nation to recognize Israel's independence. And on this landmark anniversary,America is proud to be Israel's closest ally and best friend in the world. The alliance between our governments is unbreakable, yet the source of our friendship runs deeper than any treaty. It is grounded in the shared spirit of our people, the bonds of the Book, the ties of the soul. When William Bradford stepped off the Mayflower in 1620, he quoted the words of Jeremiah: ""Come let us declare in Zion the word of God."" The founders of my country saw a new Promised Land and bestowed upon their towns names like Bethlehem and New Canaan. And in time, many Americans became passionate advocates for a Jewishstate. Centuries of suffering and sacrifice would pass before the dream was fulfilled. The Jewish people endured the agony of the pogroms, the tragedy of the Great War, and the horror of the Holocaust -- what Elie Wiesel called ""the kingdom of the night."" Soulless men took away lives and broke apart families. Yet they could not take away the spirit of the Jewish people, and they could not break the promise of God. When news of Israel's freedom finally arrived, Golda Meir, a fearless woman raised in Wisconsin, could summon only tears. She later said: ""For two thousand years we have waited for our deliverance. Now that it is here it is so great andwonderful that it surpasses human words."" The joy of independence was tempered by the outbreak of battle, a struggle that has continued for six decades. Yet in spite of the violence, in defiance of the threats, Israel has built a thriving democracy in the heart of the Holy Land. You have welcomed immigrants from far -- from the four corners of the Earth. You have forged a free and modern society based on the love of liberty, a passion for justice, and a respect for human dignity. You have workedtirelessly for peace. You have fought valiantly for freedom. My country's admiration for Israel does not end there. When Americans look at Israel, we see a pioneer spirit that worked an agricultural miracle and now leads a high-tech revolution. We see world-class universities and a global leader in business and innovation and the arts. We see a resource more valuable than oil or gold: the talent and determination of a free peoplewho refuse to let any obstacle stand in the way of their destiny. I've been fortunate to see the character of Israel up close. I've touched the Western Wall. I've seen the sun reflected in the Sea of Galilee. I have prayed at Yad -- Yad Vashem. And earlier today I visited Masada, an inspiring monument to courage and sacrifice. At this historic site, Israeli soldiers swear an oath: ""Masada shall never fall again."" Citizens of Israel: Masada shallnever fall again, and America will be at your side. This anniversary is a time to reflect on the past. It's also an opportunity to look to the future. As we go forward, our alliance will be guided by clear principles -- shared convictions rooted inmoral clarity and unswayed by popularity polls or the shifting opinions of international elites. We believe in the matchless value of every man, woman, and child: So we insist that the people of Israel have the right to a decent, normal, and peaceful life, just like thecitizens of every other nation. We believe that democracy is the only way to ensure human rights: So we consider it a source of shame that the United Nations routinely passes more human rights resolutions against the freest democracy in the Middle East than any other nation inthe world. We believe that religious liberty is fundamental to a civilized society: So we condemn anti-Semitism in all forms -- whether by those who openly question Israel's right toexist, or by others who quietly excuse them. We believe that free people should strive and sacrifice for peace: So we applaud the courageous choices Israeli's leaders have made. We also believe that nations have a right to defend themselves and that no nation should ever be forced to negotiate withkillers pledged to its destruction. We believe that targeting innocent lives to achieve political objectives is always and everywhere wrong: So we stand together against terror and extremism, and we willnever let down our guard or lose our resolve. The fight against terror and extremism is the defining challenge of our time. It's more than a clash of arms. It's a clash of visions, a great ideological struggle. On the one side are those who defend the ideals of justice and dignity with the power of reason and truth. On the other side are those who pursue a narrow vision of cruelty and control by committing murder,inciting fear, and spreading lies. This struggle is waged with the technology of the 21st century, but at its core it is an ancient battle between good and evil. The killers claim the mantle of Islam, but they are not religious men. No one who prays to the God of Abraham could strap a suicide vest to an innocent child, or blow up guiltless guests at a Passover Seder, or fly planes into office buildings filled with unsuspecting workers. In truth, the men who carry out these savage acts serve no higher goal than their own desire for power. They accept no God before themselves. And they reserve aspecial hatred for the most ardent defenders of liberty, including Americans and Israelis. And that is why the founding charter of Hamas calls for the ""elimination"" of Israel. And that is why the followers of Hezbollah chant ""Death to Israel, Death to America!"" That is why Osama bin Laden teaches that ""the killing of Jews and Americans is one of the biggest duties."" And that is why the President of Iran dreams of returning the Middle East to the Middle Ages andcalls for Israel to be wiped off the map. There are good and decent people who cannot fathom the darkness in these men and try to explain away their words. It's natural, but it is deadly wrong. As witnesses to evil in the past, we carry a solemn responsibility to take these words seriously. Jews and Americans have seen the consequences of disregarding the words of leaders who espouse hatred. And that is amistake the world must not repeat in the 21st century. Some seem to believe that we should negotiate with the terrorists and radicals, as if some ingenious argument will persuade them they have been wrong all along. We've heard this foolish delusion before. As Nazi tanks crossed into Poland in 1939, an American senator declared: ""Lord, if I could only have talked to Hitler, all this might have been avoided."" We have an obligation to call this what it is: the false comfort of appeasement, which hasbeen repeatedly discredited by history. Some people suggest if the United States w[ould] just break ties with Israel, all our problems in the Middle East would go away. This is a tired argument that buys into the propaganda of the enemies of peace, and America utterly rejects it. Israel's population may be just over seven million. But when you confront terror and evil, you are 307 million strong, because theUnited States of America stands with you. America stands with you in breaking up terrorist networks and denying the extremists sanctuary. America stands with you in firmly opposing Iran's nuclear weapons ambitions. Permitting the world's leading sponsor of terror to possess the world's deadliest weapons would be an unforgivable betrayal for future generations. For the sake of peace, the worldmust not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon. Ultimately, ultimately to prevail in this struggle, we must offer an alternative to the ideology of the extremists by extending our vision of justice and tolerance and freedom and hope. These values are the self-evident right of all people, of all religions, in all the world because they are a gift from the Almighty God. Securing these rights is also the surest way to secure peace. Leaders who are accountable to their people will not pursue endless confrontation and bloodshed. Young people with a place in their society and a voice in their future are less likely to search for meaning in radicalism. Societies where citizens can express their conscience andworship their God will not export violence, they will be partners in peace. The fundamental insight, that freedom yields peace, is the great lesson of the 20th century. Now our task is to apply it to the 21st. Nowhere is this work more urgent than here in the Middle East. We must stand with the reformers working to break the old patterns of tyranny and despair. We must give voice to millions of ordinary people who dream for a better life in a free society. We must confront the moral relativism that views all forms of government as equally acceptable and thereby consigns whole societies to slavery. Above all, we must have faith in our values and ourselves and confidently pursue the expansion of liberty as the pathto a peaceful future. That future will be a dramatic departure from the Middle East of today. So as we mark 60 years from Israel's founding, let us try to envision the region 60 years from now. This vision is not going to arrive easily or overnight; it will encounter violent resistance. But if we and future Presidents and future Knessets maintain our resolve and have faith in our ideals, here's theMiddle East that we can see: Israel will be celebrating the 120th anniversary as one of the world's greatdemocracies, a secure and flourishing homeland for the Jewish people. The Palestinian people will have the homeland they have long dreamed of and deserved -- a democratic state that is governed by law, and respects human rights,and rejects terror. From Cairo to Riyadh to Baghdad and Beirut, people will live in free and independent societies, where a desire for peace is reinforced by ties of diplomacy and tourism andtrade. Iran and Syria will be peaceful nations, with today's oppressive -- oppression a distant memory and where people are free to speak their minds and develop their God-giventalents. Al Qaeda and Hezbollah and Hamas will be defeated, as Muslims across the regionrecognize the emptiness of the terrorists' vision and the injustice of their cause. Overall, the Middle East will be characterized by a new period of tolerance and integration. And this doesn't mean that Israel and its neighbors will be best of friends. But when leaders across the region answer to their people, they will focus theirenergies on schools and jobs, not on rocket attacks and suicide bombings. With this change, Israel will open a new hopeful chapter in which its people can live a normallife, and the dream of Herzl and the founders of 1948 can be fully and finally realized. This is a bold vision, and some will say it can never be achieved. But think about what we have witnessed in our own time. When Europe was destroying itself through total war and genocide, it was difficult to envision a continent that six decades later would be free and at peace. When Japanese pilots were flying suicide missions into American battleships, it seemed impossible that six decades later Japan would be a democracy, a lynchpin of security in Asia, and one of America's closest friends. And when waves of refugees arrived here in the desert with nothing, surrounded by hostile armies, it was almost unimaginable that Israel would growinto one of the freest and most successful nations on the earth. Yet each one of these transformations took place. And a future of transformation is possible in the Middle East, so long as a new generation of leaders has the courage to defeat the enemies of freedom, to make the hard choices necessary for peace, and stand firm on the solid rock ofuniversal values. Sixty years ago, on the eve of Israel's independence, the last British soldiers departing Jerusalem stopped at a building in the Jewish quarter of the Old City. An officer knocked on the door and met a senior rabbi.3 The officer presented him with a short iron bar -- the key to the Zion Gate -- and said it was the first time in 18 centuries that a key to the gates of Jerusalem had belonged to a Jew. His hands trembling, the rabbi offered a prayer of thanksgiving to God, ""Who had granted us life and permitted us to reach this day."" Then he turned to the officer, and uttered the words Jews had awaited for so long: ""I accept this key inthe name of my people."" Over the past six decades, the Jewish people have established a state that would make that humble rabbi proud. You've raised a modern society in the Promised Land, a light unto the nations that preserves the legacy of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. And you have built a mighty democracy that will endure forever and can always count on the United States ofAmerica to be at your side. God bless. 1""Happy Independence Day"" 2""Eretz Yisrael - (Hebrew) Land of Israel; (modern) Jewish homeland to be established in the general area of Palestine. In Ottoman Turkishtimes, Eretz Yisrael and Eretz Hakodesh (the Holy Land) were used to designate the area surrounding Jerusalem and including areas from theLitani river in the north to modern Eilat.

"Klaus, thank you very much. Thanks for inviting me. Klaus said, it's about time you showed up. Proud to be here. Laura and I are so honored that, Klaus, you gave us a chance to come. I do want to thank President Mubarak and Mrs. Mubarak for their wonderful hospitality. I want to thank the members of Congress who are here. I appreciate the heads of state who have joined us. I thank the foreign ministers who are here, including my own, Secretary of StateCondoleezza Rice. And I want to thank the members of the Diplomatic Corps. Laura and I are delighted to be in Egypt, and we bring the warm wishes of the American people. We're proud of our long friendship with your citizens. We respect your remarkable history. And we're humbled to walk in the ancient land of pharaohs, where a great civilizationtook root and wrote some of the first chapters in the epic story of humanity. America is a much younger nation, but we've made our mark by advancing ideals as old as the pyramids. Those ideals of liberty and justice have sparked a revolution across much of the world. This hopeful movement made its way to places where dictators once reigned and peaceful democracies seemed unimaginable: places like Chile and Indonesia and Poland and the Philippines and South Korea. These nations have different histories and different traditions. Yet each made the same democratic transition, and they did it on their own terms. In these countries, millions every year are rising from poverty. Women are realizing overdueopportunities. And people of faith are finding the blessing of worshiping God in peace. All these changes took place in the second half of the 20th century. I strongly believe that if leaders like those of you in this room act with vision and resolve, the first half of 21st century can be the time when similar advances reach the Middle East. This region is home to energetic people, a powerful spirit of enterprise, and tremendous resources. It is capable of a very bright future -- a future in which the Middle East is a place of innovation and discovery, drivenby free men and women. In recent years, we've seen hopeful beginnings toward this vision. Turkey, a nation with a majority Muslim population, is a prosperous modern democracy. Afghanistan under the leadership of President Karzai is overcoming the Taliban and building a free society. Iraq under the leadership of Prime Minister Maliki is establishing a multi-ethnic democracy. We have seen the stirrings of reform from Morocco and Algeria to Jordan and the Gulf States. And isolation from the outside world is being overcome by the most democratic of innovations: the cell phone and the Internet. America appreciates the challenges facing the Middle East. Yetthe light of liberty is beginning to shine. There is much to do to build on this momentum. From diversifying your economies, to investing in your people, to extending the reach of freedom, nations across the region have an opportunity to move forward with bold and confident reforms -- and lead the Middle East to itsrightful place as a center of progress and achievement. Taking your place as a center of progress and achievement requires economic reform. This is a time of strength for many of your nations' economies. Since 2004, economic growth in the region has averaged more than 5 percent. Trade has expanded significantly. Technology has advanced rapidly. Foreign investment has increased dramatically. And unemployment rates have decreased in many nations. Egypt, for example, has posted strong economic growth, developed some of the world's fastest growing telecommunications companies, and made major investments that will boost tourism and trade. In order for this economic progress to result in permanent prosperity and an Egypt that reaches its full potential, however, economic reform must be accompanied by political reform. And I continue to hope that Egypt can leadthe region in political reform. This is also a time to prepare for the economic changes ahead. Rising price of oil has brought great wealth to some in this region, but the supply of oil is limited, and nations like mine are aggressively developing alternatives to oil. Over time, as the world becomes less dependent on oil, nations in the Middle East will have to build more diverse and more dynamiceconomies. Your greatest asset in this quest is the entrepreneurial spirit of your people. The best way to take advantage of that spirit is to make reforms that unleash individual creativity and innovation. Your economies will be more vibrant when citizens who dream of starting their own companies can do so quickly, without high regulatory and registration costs. Your economies will be more dynamic when property rights are protected and risk-taking is encouraged -- not punished -- by law. Your economies will be more resilient when you adopt modern agricultural techniques that make farmers more productive and the food supply more secure. And your economies will have greater long-term prosperity when taxes are low and allyour citizens know that their innovation and hard work will be rewarded. One of the most powerful drivers of economic growth is free trade. So nations in this region would benefit greatly from breaking down barriers to trade with each other. And America will continue working to open up trade at every level. In recent years, the United States has completed free trade agreements with Jordan, Oman, Morocco, and Bahrain. America will continue to negotiate bilateral free trade agreements in the region. We strongly supported Saudi Arabia's accession to the World Trade Organization, and we will continue to support nations making the reforms necessary to join the institutions of a global economy. To break down trade barriers and ignite economic growth around the world, we will worktirelessly for a successful outcome to the Doha Round this year. As we seek to open new markets abroad, America will keep our markets open at home. There are voices in my country that urge America to adopt measures that would isolate us from the global economy. I firmly reject these calls for protectionism. We will continue to welcomeforeign investment and trade. And the United States of America will stay open for business. Taking your place as a center of progress and achievement requires investing in your people. Some analysts believe the Middle East and North Africa will need to create up to 100 million new jobs over the next 10 to 15 years just to keep up with population growth. The key torealizing this goal is an educated workforce. This starts early on, with primary schools that teach basic skills, such as reading and math, rather than indoctrinating children with ideologies of hatred. An educated workforce also requires good high schools and universities, where students are exposed to a variety of ideas, learn to think for themselves, and develop the capacity to innovate. Not long ago the region marked a hopeful milestone in higher education. In our meeting yesterday, President Karzai told me he recently handed out diplomas to university graduates, including 300 degrees in medicine, and a hundred degrees in engineering, and a lot of degrees to lawyers, and many ofthe recipients were women. People of the Middle East can count on the United States to be a strong partner in improving your educational systems. We are sponsoring training programs for teachers and administrators in nations like Jordan and Morocco and Lebanon. We sponsored English language programs where students can go for intensive language instruction. We have translated more than 80 children's books into Arabic. And we have developed new onlinecurricula for students from kindergarten through high school. It is also in America's interest to continue welcoming aspiring young adults from this region for higher education to the United States. There were understandable concerns about student visas after 9/11. My administration has worked hard to improve the visa process. And I'm pleased to report that we are issuing a growing numbers of student visas to young people from the Middle East. And that's the way it should be. And we'll continue to work to expand educational exchanges, because we benefit from the contribution of foreign students who study in America because we're proud to train the world's leaders of tomorrow and because we know there is no better antidote to the propaganda ofour enemies than firsthand experience with life in the United States of America. Building powerful economies also requires expanding the role of women in society. This is a matter of morality and of basic math. No nation that cuts off half its population from opportunities will be as productive or prosperous as it could be. Women are a formidable force, as I have seen in my own family and my own administration. As the nations of theMiddle East open up their laws and their societies to women, they are learning the same thing. I applaud Egypt. Egypt is a model for the development of professional women. In Afghanistan, girls who were once denied even a basic education are now going to school, and a whole generation of Afghans will grow up with the intellectual tools to lead their nation toward prosperity. In Iraq and Kuwait, women are joining political parties and running campaigns and serving in public office. In some Gulf States, women entrepreneurs are making a living and aname for themselves in the business world. Recently, I learned of a woman in Bahrain who owns her own shipping company. She started with a small office and two employees. When she first tried to register her business in her own name, she was turned down. She attended a business training class and was the only woman to participate. And when she applied for a customs license, officials expressed surprisebecause no woman had ever asked for one before. And yet with hard work and determination, she turned her small company into a $2 million enterprise. And this year, Huda Janahi was named one of the 50 most powerful businesswomen in the Arab world. Huda is an inspiring example for the whole region. And America's message to other women in the Middle East is this: You have a great deal to contribute, you should have a strong voice in leading your countries, and my nation looks tothe day when you have the rights and privileges you deserve. Taking your place as a center of progress and achievement requires extending the reach of freedom. Expanding freedom is vital to turning temporary wealth into lasting prosperity. Free societies stimulate competition in the marketplace. Free societies give people access to information they need to make informed and responsible decisions. And free societies give citizens the rule of law, which exposes corruption and buildsconfidence in the future. Freedom is also the basis for a democratic system of government, which is the only fair and just ordering of society and the only way to guarantee the God-given rights of all people. Democracies do not take the same shape; they develop at different speeds and in different ways, and they reflect the unique cultures and traditions of their people. There are skeptics about democracy in this part of the world, I understand that. But as more people in the Middle East gain firsthand experience from freedom, many of the arguments against democracy arebeing discredited. For example, some say that democracy is a Western value that America seeks to impose on unwilling citizens. This is a condescending form of moral relativism. The truth is that freedom is a universal right -- the Almighty's gift to every man, woman, and child on the face of Earth. And as we've seen time and time again, when people are allowed to make a choice between freedom and the alternative, they choose freedom. In Afghanistan, 8 million people defied the terrorist threats to vote for a democratic President. In Iraq, 12 million people waved ink- stained fingers to celebrate the first democratic election in decades. And in a recent survey of the Muslim world, there was overwhelming support for one of the central tenets of democracy,freedom of speech: 99 percent in Lebanon, 94 percent here in Egypt, and 92 percent in Iran. There are people who claim that democracy is incompatible with Islam. But the truth is that democracies, by definition, make a place for people of religious belief. America is one of the most -- is one of the world's leading democracies, and we're also one of the most religious nations in the world. More than three-quarters of our citizens believe in a higher power. Millions worship every week and pray every day. And they do so without fear of reprisal from the state. In our democracy, we would never punish a person for owning a Koran. We would never issue a death sentence to someone for converting to Islam. Democracy does not threaten Islam or any religion. Democracy is the only system of government that guaranteestheir protection. Some say any state that holds an election is a democracy. But true democracy requires vigorous political parties allowed to engage in free and lively debate. True democracy requires the establishment of civic institutions that ensure an election's legitimacy and hold leaders accountable. And true democracy requires competitive elections in which oppositioncandidates are allowed to campaign without fear or intimidation. Too often in the Middle East, politics has consisted of one leader in power and the opposition in jail. America is deeply concerned about the plight of political prisoners in this region, as well as democratic activists who are intimidated or repressed, newspapers and civil society organizations that are shut down, and dissidents whose voices are stifled. The time has come for nations across the Middle East to abandon these practices, and treat their people with dignity and the respect they deserve. I call on all nations to release their prisoners ofconscience, open up their political debate, and trust their people to chart their future. The vision I have outlined today is shared by many in this region -- but unfortunately, there are some spoilers who stand in the way. Terrorist organizations and their state sponsors know they cannot survive in a free society, so they create chaos and take innocent lives in an effort to stop democracy from taking root. They are on the wrong side in a great ideological struggle -- and every nation committed to freedom and progress in the Middle East must standtogether to defeat them. We must stand with the Palestinian people, who have suffered for decades and earned the right to be a homeland of their own -- have a homeland of their own. I strongly support a two-state solution -- a democratic Palestine based on law and justice that will live with peace and security alongside a democrat Israel. I believe that the Palestinian people will build a thriving democracy in which entrepreneurs pursue their dreams, and families own their homesin lively communities, and young people grow up with hope in the future. Last year at Annapolis, we made a hopeful beginning toward a peace negotiation that will outline what this nation of Palestine will look like -- a contiguous state where Palestinians live in prosperity and dignity. A peace agreement is in the Palestinians' interests, it is in Israel's interests, it is in Arab states' interests, and it is in the world's interests. And I firmly believethat with leadership and courage, we can reach that peace agreement this year. This is a demanding task. It requires action on all sides. Palestinians must fight terror and continue to build the institutions of a free and peaceful society. Israel must make tough sacrifices for peace and ease the restrictions on the Palestinians. Arab states, especially oil- rich nations, must seize this opportunity to invest aggressively in the Palestinian people and to move past their old resentments against Israel. And all nations in the region must stand together in confronting Hamas, which is attempting to undermine efforts at peace with acts ofterror and violence. We must stand with the people of Lebanon in their struggle to build a sovereign and independent democracy. This means opposing Hezbollah terrorists, funded by Iran, who recently revealed their true intentions by taking up arms against the Lebanese people. It is now clearer than ever that Hezbollah militias are the enemy of a free Lebanon -- and all nations, especially neighbors in the region, have an interest to help the Lebanese peopleprevail. We must stand with the people of Iraq and Afghanistan and other nations in the region fighting against al Qaeda and other extremists. Bin Laden and his followers have made clear that anyone who does not share their extremist ideology is fit for murder. That means every government in the Middle East is a target of al Qaeda. And America is a target too. Andtogether, we will confront and we will defeat this threat to civilization. We must stand with the good and decent people of Iran and Syria, who deserve so much better than the life they have today. Every peaceful nation in the region has an interest in stopping these nations from supporting terrorism. And every peaceful nation in the region has an interest in opposing Iran's nuclear weapons ambitions. To allow the world's leading sponsor of terror to gain the world's deadliest weapon would be an unforgivable betrayal of futuregenerations. For the sake of peace, the world must not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon. The changes I have discussed today will not come easily -- change never does. But the reform movement in the Middle East has a powerful engine: demographics. Sixty percent of the population is under 30 years old. Many of these young people surf the web, own cell phones, have satellite televisions. They have access to unprecedented amounts of information. They see what freedom has brought to millions of others and contrast that to what they have athome. Today, I have a message for these young people: Some tell -- some will tell you change is impossible, but history has a way of surprising us, and change can happen more quickly than we expect. In the past century, one concept has transcended borders, cultures, and languages. In Arabic, ""hurriyya"" -- in English, ""freedom."" Across the world, the call forfreedom lives in our hearts, endures in our prayers, and joins humanity as one. I know these are trying times, but the future is in your hands -- and freedom and peace are within your grasp. Just imagine what this region could look like in 60 years. The Palestinian people will have the homeland they have long dreamed of and deserve -- a democratic state that is governed by law, respects human rights, and rejects terror. Israel will be celebrating its 120 anniversary as one of the world's great democracies -- a secure and flourishinghomeland for the Jewish people. From Cairo, Riyadh, Baghdad to Beirut, people will live in free and independent societies, where a desire for peace is reinforced by ties of diplomacy and tourism and trade. Iran and Syria will be peaceful nations, where today's oppression is a distant memory and people are free to speak their minds and develop their talents. Al Qaeda, Hezbollah, and Hamas will be defeated, as Muslims across the region recognize the emptiness of the terrorists' vision andthe injustice of their cause. This vision is the same one I outlined in my address to the Israeli Knesset. Yet it's not a Jewish vision or a Muslim vision, not an American vision or an Arab vision. It is a universal vision, based on the timeless principles of dignity and tolerance and justice -- and it unites allwho yearn for freedom and peace in this ancient land. Realizing this vision will not be easy. It will take time, and sacrifice, and resolve. Yet there is no doubt in my mind that you are up to the challenge -- and with your ingenuity and your enterprise and your courage, this historic vision for the Middle East will be realized. May Godbe with you on the journey, and the United States of America always will be at your side. Thank you for having me.",bush
"Good evening. This is an extraordinary period for America's economy. Over the past few weeks, many Americans have felt anxiety about their finances and their future. I understand their worry and their frustration. We've seen triple-digit swings in the stock market. Major financial institutions have teetered on the edge of collapse, and some have failed. As uncertainty has grown, many banks have restricted lending. Credit markets have frozen. Andfamilies and businesses have found it harder to borrow money. We're in the midst of a serious financial crisis, and the federal government is responding with decisive action. We've boosted confidence in money market mutual funds, and acted toprevent major investors from intentionally driving down stocks for their own personal gain. Most importantly, my administration is working with Congress to address the root cause behind much of the instability in our markets. Financial assets related to home mortgages have lost value during the housing decline. And the banks holding these assets have restricted credit. As a result, our entire economy is in danger. So I've proposed that the federal government reduce the risk posed by these troubled assets, and supply urgently-neededmoney so banks and other financial institutions can avoid collapse and resume lending. This rescue effort is not aimed at preserving any individual company or industry -- it is aimed at preserving America's overall economy. It will help American consumers and businesses get credit to meet their daily needs and create jobs. And it will help send a signal to marketsaround the world that America's financial system is back on track. I know many Americans have questions tonight: How did we reach this point in our economy? How will the solution I've proposed work? And what does this mean for your financial future?These are good questions, and they deserve clear answers. First, how did our economy reach this point? Well, most economists agree that the problems we are witnessing today developed over a long period of time. For more than a decade, a massive amount of money flowed into the United States from investors abroad, because our country is an attractive and secure place to do business. This large influx of money to U.S. banks and financial institutions -- along with low interest rates -- made it easier for Americans to get credit. These developments allowed more families to borrow money for cars and homes and college tuition -- some for the firsttime. They allowed more entrepreneurs to get loans to start new businesses and create jobs. Unfortunately, there were also some serious negative consequences, particularly in the housing market. Easy credit -- combined with the faulty assumption that home values would continue to rise -- led to excesses and bad decisions. Many mortgage lenders approved loans for borrowers without carefully examining their ability to pay. Many borrowers took out loans larger than they could afford, assuming that they could sell or refinance their homes at ahigher price later on. Optimism about housing values also led to a boom in home construction. Eventually the number of new houses exceeded the number of people willing to buy them. And with supply exceeding demand, housing prices fell. And this created a problem: Borrowers with adjustable rate mortgages who had been planning to sell or refinance their homes at a higher price were stuck with homes worth less than expected -- along with mortgage payments they could notafford. As a result, many mortgage holders began to default. These widespread defaults had effects far beyond the housing market. See, in today's mortgage industry, home loans are often packaged together, and converted into financial products called ""mortgage-backed securities."" These securities were sold to investors around the world. Many investors assumed these securities were trustworthy, and asked few questions about their actual value. Two of the leading purchasers of mortgage-backed securities were Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Because these companies were chartered by Congress, many believed they were guaranteed by the federal government. This allowed them to borrow enormous sums of money, fuel the market for questionable investments, and putour financial system at risk. The decline in the housing market set off a domino effect across our economy. When home values declined, borrowers defaulted on their mortgages, and investors holding mortgage- backed securities began to incur serious losses. Before long, these securities became so unreliable that they were not being bought or sold. Investment banks such as Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers found themselves saddled with large amounts of assets they could not sell. They ran out of the money needed to meet their immediate obligations. And they faced imminent collapse. Other banks found themselves in severe financial trouble. These banks began holding on to their money, and lending dried up, and the gears of the Americanfinancial system began grinding to a halt. With the situation becoming more precarious by the day, I faced a choice: To step in with dramatic government action, or to stand back and allow the irresponsible actions of some toundermine the financial security of all. I'm a strong believer in free enterprise. So my natural instinct is to oppose government intervention. I believe companies that make bad decisions should be allowed to go out of business. Under normal circumstances, I would have followed this course. But these are not normal circumstances. The market is not functioning properly. There's been a widespread loss of confidence. And major sectors of America's financial system are at risk ofshutting down. The government's top economic experts warn that without immediate action by Congress,America could slip into a financial panic, and a distressing scenario would unfold: More banks could fail, including some in your community. The stock market would drop even more, which would reduce the value of your retirement account. The value of your home could plummet. Foreclosures would rise dramatically. And if you own a business or a farm, you would find it harder and more expensive to get credit. More businesses would close their doors, and millions of Americans could lose their jobs. Even if you have good credit history, it would be more difficult for you to get the loans you need to buy a car or send your children tocollege. And ultimately, our country could experience a long and painful recession. Fellow citizens: We must not let this happen. I appreciate the work of leaders from both parties in both houses of Congress to address this problem -- and to make improvements to the proposal my administration sent to them. There is a spirit of cooperation between Democrats and Republicans, and between Congress and this administration. In that spirit, I've invited Senators McCain and Obama to join congressional leaders of both parties at the WhiteHouse tomorrow to help speed our discussions toward a bipartisan bill. I know that an economic rescue package will present a tough vote for many members of Congress. It is difficult to pass a bill that commits so much of the taxpayers' hard-earned money. I also understand the frustration of responsible Americans who pay their mortgages on time, file their tax returns every April 15th, and are reluctant to pay the cost of excesses on Wall Street. But given the situation we are facing, not passing a bill now would cost theseAmericans much more later. Many Americans are asking: How would a rescue plan work? After much discussion, there is now widespread agreement on the principles such a plan would include. It would remove the risk posed by the troubled assets -- including mortgage- backed securities -- now clogging the financial system. This would free banks to resume the flow of credit to American families and businesses. Any rescue plan should also be designed to ensure that taxpayers are protected. It should welcome the participation of financial institutions large and small. It should make certain that failed executives do not receive a windfall from your tax dollars. It should establish a bipartisan board to oversee the plan's implementation. And it should be enacted as soon aspossible. In close consultation with Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, and SEC Chairman Chris Cox, I announced a plan on Friday. First, the plan is big enough to solve a serious problem. Under our proposal, the federal government would put up to $700 billion taxpayer dollars on the line to purchase troubled assets that are clogging the financial system. In the short term, this will free up banks to resume the flow of credit toAmerican families and businesses. And this will help our economy grow. Second, as markets have lost confidence in mortgage-backed securities, their prices have dropped sharply. Yet the value of many of these assets will likely be higher than their current price, because the vast majority of Americans will ultimately pay off their mortgages. The government is the one institution with the patience and resources to buy these assets at their current low prices and hold them until markets return to normal. And when that happens, money will flow back to the Treasury as these assets are sold. And we expect that much, ifnot all, of the tax dollars we invest will be paid back. A final question is: What does this mean for your economic future? The primary steps -- purpose of the steps I have outlined tonight is to safeguard the financial security of American workers and families and small businesses. The federal government also continues to enforce laws and regulations protecting your money. The Treasury Department recently offered government insurance for money market mutual funds. And through the FDIC, every savings account, checking account, and certificate of deposit is insured by the federal government for up to $100,000. The FDIC has been in existence for 75 years, and noone has ever lost a penny on an insured deposit -- and this will not change. Once this crisis is resolved, there will be time to update our financial regulatory structures. Our 21st century global economy remains regulated largely by outdated 20th century laws. Recently, we've seen how one company can grow so large that its failure jeopardizes theentire financial system. Earlier this year, Secretary Paulson proposed a blueprint that would modernize our financial regulations. For example, the Federal Reserve would be authorized to take a closer look at the operations of companies across the financial spectrum and ensure that their practices do not threaten overall financial stability. There are other good ideas, and members of Congress should consider them. As they do, they must ensure that efforts to regulate Wall Street do notend up hampering our economy's ability to grow. In the long run, Americans have good reason to be confident in our economic strength. Despite corrections in the marketplace and instances of abuse, democratic capitalism is the best system ever devised. It has unleashed the talents and the productivity, and entrepreneurial spirit of our citizens. It has made this country the best place in the world to invest and do business. And it gives our economy the flexibility and resilience to absorbshocks, adjust, and bounce back. Our economy is facing a moment of great challenge. But we've overcome tough challenges before -- and we will overcome this one. I know that Americans sometimes get discouraged by the tone in Washington, and the seemingly endless partisan struggles. Yet history has shown that in times of real trial, elected officials rise to the occasion. And together, we will show the world once again what kind of country America is -- a nation that tackles problems head on, where leaders come together to meet great tests, and where people of everybackground can work hard, develop their talents, and realize their dreams. Thank you for listening. May God bless you.",bush
"Thank you. Welcome. Good morning. This is a special day for the White House. Laura and I are proud to welcome the greatest Olympic and Paralympic team ever assembled. And I bring greetings from the honorarycaptain of the Olympic teams -- President George H. W. Bush. We call him 41. I want to thank the members of the Cabinet who are here, and the administration. I want to thank the coaches and the team leaders, and the U.S. Olympic Committee leadership and staff for being here. We welcome the representatives of Chicago 2016 who are here. Members of the U.S. Armed Forces, moms, dads, girlfriends, boyfriends, supporters of the mighty Olympicteam, we're glad you're here. I do want to welcome members of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, including John Burke, the Chairman; Dot Richardson, the Vice Chairman -- by the way, member of the 1996 and 2000 U.S. Olympic gold medal softball teams. And the reason I want to mention them is today the Health and Human Services is issuing its Physical Fitness Guidelines, and there's no better time to remind our fellow citizens that physical fitness will lead to a healthy America. Just look what's happened to the people surrounding me. And so we urge our fellow citizens to look at these guidelines and to take time out of your day to exercise. Now, not every one of you has to ride a mountain bike. But ifyou walk just 20 minutes a day you'll help America and help yourself. Attending the Beijing Olympics was one of the great experiences of our lifetime. Laura and I had a fantastic experience. We will never forget the first night at the Bird's Nest for the spectacular Opening Ceremony. When the Team USA was announced, there was a notable increase in the cheers. And then came the greatest sight of all -- more than 500 America's --of America's finest athletes marching behind our flag, carried by Bernard Lagat.1 It was an incredible sight, and I know it was a moment that all of our athletes looked forward to and it'sa moment that we were so honored to share with you. In the weeks that followed, our Olympic team took part in the largest games ever held. Over 100,000 [sic]2 athletes competed in more than 300 events. An unprecedented 87 countries brought home medals. Forty-three world records were broken. About 4.7 billion viewerswatched the Olympics. And with the eyes of the world turned on Beijing, our teams rose to the occasion. The Olympicteam finished with the top medal count of 110 medals. But more impressive was the decency and character that these Olympics brought on the world stage. I know you worked hard -- the Olympics and Paralympic teams worked hard to get to this moment. Whether you won a medal or not, it really doesn't matter in the long run. What really matters is the honor you brought to your sports and to your families and to yourcountry. And we thank you for the lasting memories that you gave us all. And so here are some of the lasting memories that I will take with me forever. First of all, the Water Cube -- watching Jason Lezak touch out I think it was the French team -- on the 4x100 freestyle relay, and thenwatching the joy of his teammates, including Michael Phelps. People say, did you ever get to meet Michael Phelps? I said I did. So that was the highlight? I said, not really; meeting his mother was more of a highlight. She reminded me of my mother-- plainspoken and full of love. So, Michael, we congratulate you. We thank you for joining us today. And we congratulate allthe swimmers for the Olympic team. And how about our gymnasts? Nastia Liukin and Shawn Johnson. What I found interesting was that these champions were roommates while they were competing for gold. And one wonders whether or not that friendship would be damaged in the heat of the competition. The truth of the matter is, it wasn't. They showed the true Olympic spirit of being competitors in the gym, but being friends in the dorm. And so we welcome these two champions here today, and wethank you for setting such a good example. So, as you know, I'm a baseball guy, and have come to admire women's softball a lot. Yes. So I know with us today are Finch, Duran, Abbot, Galindo, Lappin, Lowe, Berg and Watley --members of the U.S. Olympic women's softball team. I bring this up because I really think that these women are an inspiration to young girls all across the globe, and the Olympics would be smart to keep women's softball as a part of itsprogram. And I want to thank you for welcoming [me] to your practice. I also want to welcome today a fellow Texan named Laura Wilkinson. At Sydney she stunned the world by taking gold. This summer, she returned to the Olympic stage for the third and final time, and she was fighting through injuries. But she brought such class to the arena. There was never any of this, ""Woe is me; how pitiful is life."" She said she was honored to compete. She and her husband have returned home to the great state of Texas to raise money for a new diving center in The Woodlands, Texas. In other words, she had put something back into the community. And I urge all of us -- whether we're Olympic -- Olympians or not to recognize the opportunity to make the communities in which we live abetter place. Laura, welcome and thank you for the example you have set. So I spent a little time at the beach volleyball arena. I got to meet Todd Rogers and Phil Dalhausser. These two men are incredible athletes and they -- it was really interesting to be there to watch them warm up. And then they introduced me to the Brazilian team and to the Italian team, and it was really a lot of fun -- but not nearly as much fun as spending time withMisty May-Treaner and Kerri Walsh. These two women are not only great athletes, they're really great people. And I'm just so sorry that Misty May got injured on Dancing [with] the Stars. God, if only she had me as a partner, you know? Except I can't dance. But I wish -- you know, it's interesting, I read a comment from Misty May today. She said, yes, I got hurt Dancing on [sic] the Stars, but I'llbe back at the 2012 Olympics. I also know that all of us were deeply touched by what happened to Hugh McCutcheon and his family. Nevertheless, we were greatly inspired when the men's volleyball team rallied. They won an incredible gold medal against all odds to really help lift up the coach's family and hisspirits, as well as the whole nation's spirits. I congratulate the men and women's basketball teams. You can just imagine what it was like when the men's basketball team asked me to get in one of their huddles right before the game against China. I was like a jockey. But they brought a lot of class to the courts, both teams did. What impressed me and Laura was that the men were there cheering on the women, and the women were there cheering on the men. There was ample opportunity for people to ""big shot"" it at the Olympics. Not our athletes. They were there for the right reason,to support their teams and to support their nations, our nation. Now, one of the things that we really regret missing was the -- being in the Bird's Nest for the 13th Paralympic Games. And we congratulate the athletes who are here, as well. Werecognize your hard work, and we're proud to call you Olympians. I'm particularly pleased to be here with those who have worn the uniform of our country. On the America team were 16 men and women who served the nation in uniform -- one of whom was Army Lieutenant Melissa Stockwell. She lost her leg while serving our country in Iraq. Four years after hard work, four years after significant rehabilitation, she qualified as aswimmer. And her teammates elected her as the flag bearer for the Closing Ceremonies. We welcome you, Melissa, and we welcome you all. Long after we leave the White House, Laura and I will remember the extraordinary spirit and kindness of the athletes that we have met here at the White House and in Beijing. One unforgettable moment came after swimmer Larsen Jensen won the bronze medal in the 400 freestyle relay. When he was presented his bouquet of flowers, he looked around the Water Cube and he made a special delivery: He climbed into the stands and he gave the bouquet to Laura. It was an incredibly kind gesture -- and by the way, Larsen, our anniversary is next month if you'd like to go. He also told me something in private, where he said he looksforward to serving our country. Our Olympic athletes have served our country in many ways. But you have a chance to continue to serve. And we honor your service as athletes, and we look forward to honoringyour service as worthy citizens of our great country. You amazed the world with your talent and grace and sportsmanship. You inspired children tochase their dreams. You will be champions forever. May God bless you, and may God bless America. 1 Lopez Lamong was the flag bearer for the U.S. during the Opening Ceremonies of the 2008 Summer Olympic Games. Bernard Lagatparticipated in the 1500m (semifinals) and 5000m distance races in those Olympics. 2 11,028 athletes competed in the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China",bush
"Mr. Director, thank you for your kind introduction and thank you for your leadership. Proud that you invited your wife, Ann, here to be with us. I thank the Attorney General for joining us today. Members of the FBI Academy staff, distinguished guests, family and friends, and mostimportantly, members of the graduating class: Thanks for having me. I am so pleased to be back to the FBI Academy, and to share with you this special day. When you walk across the stage, you will receive your badge and your credentials. You'll become special agents of the FBI. You will take your place on the front lines on the war on terror. I thank you for stepping forward to serve your country during this important time. And onbehalf of all Americans, I congratulate the Class of 08-14. This academy has prepared you for the privileges and responsibilities of carrying the badge. Over the past 20 weeks, you have passed rigorous academic and physical requirements. You have spent hours practicing your aim on the firing range, combing the streets of Hogan's Alley, and navigating the Academy's ""gerbil tubes."" As part of your training, you were all forced to endure the sting of pepper spray -- which you learned wasn't half as bad as thecafeteria food. To reach this day of accomplishment, you have all depended on the wisdom and advice of your instructors. They took a diverse group that includes combat veterans, police officers, firefighters, lawyers, language experts, and computer specialists. And they turned you into an impressive class of FBI special agents. Your instructors are proud of your accomplishments --and I know you are grateful for their leadership. To reach this day of accomplishment, you depended on the support of your loved ones. While you were away training for this academy, some of them were really sweating out the training for you. And Rick mentioned a lot of you were packing bags. I'm thankful you didn't mentionCrawford, Texas. And so are you. But the point is, America owes your families a great debt. And we thank you for standing by your side -- thank them for standing by your side during this moment of training and theservice you'll be rendering to our country. We welcome the families here today. Members of this class join the FBI during a momentous time in our nation's history. Earlier this summer the FBI celebrated its 100th anniversary. Unfortunately I wasn't able to attend the official ceremony. So I asked the Attorney General to speak in my place. To be honest, I was somewhat concerned that he might not live up to my high standards of oratory. He toldme I had nothing to worry about. The Bureau has come a long way since its founding. Over the past century, the FBI has grown from a small team of 34 investigators to a powerful force of more than 30,000 agents and analysts and support professionals serving around the world. The FBI has pushed the boundaries of forensic science -- from mastering the art of fingerprints to pioneering the use of DNA evidence. The FBI has inspired generations of children to dream of joining the force. Sounds like I inspired one or two myself. In every era, the FBI has risen to meet new challenges. When mobsters brought crime and chaos to America's cities during the 1920s and '30s, the G-Men of the FBI brought them to justice. When America entered the Second World War, the FBI stopped Axis agents from carrying out attacks on our homeland. During the Cold War, the FBI worked long hours to protect America from Soviet spies. In all this work, the FBI has gained an incredible record of achievement and has earned the admiration of the entire world. America honors all the finemen and women who have served in the ranks before you. As you go forth from this Academy, you're going to write a new chapter in the FBI's storied history. In the years ahead, your assignments will be as diverse as the FBI's mission -- from dismantling organized criminal networks, to pulling the plug on online predators, to making white-collar criminals pay for defrauding hardworking Americans. And just as your predecessors adapted to meet the challenges of the past century, there's no doubt in my mindyou'll respond with courage to confront the emerging dangers of this new century. Those dangers became clear on September the 11th, 2001. On that day, 19 terrorists brought death and destruction to our shores. We became a nation at war against violent extremists.And we must not rest until that war is won. More than seven years have passed without another attack on our soil. And this is not an accident. Since 9/11, we have gone on the offense against the terrorists abroad -- so we do not have to face them here at home. We stand with young democracies in Afghanistan and Iraq and beyond as they seek to replace the hateful ideology of the extremists with a hopefulalternative of liberty. Here at home, we've transformed our national security institutions and have given our intelligence and law enforcement professionals the tools and the resources they need to do their job, and that is to protect the American people. We formed a new Department of Homeland Security. We created a new Director for National Intelligence. We established a program at the Central Intelligence Agency to interrogate key terrorist leaders captured in the war on terror. We worked with Congress to pass legislation that allows our intelligence professionals to quickly and effectively monitor terrorist communications while protecting the civil liberties of our citizens. If al Qaeda is making a phone call into the United States, we needto know why and to whom they're calling in order to protect the American citizens. The FBI has played a vital role in doing the most important job that government has, and that is to secure the American people from harm. Since 9/11, the Bureau has worked with our partners around the world to disrupt planned terrorist attacks. Most Americans will never know the full stories of how these attacks were stopped and how many lives were saved. But we know this: The men and women of the FBI are working tirelessly to keep our nation safe --and they have the thanks of the American people. The FBI's leadership in the war on terror has required a dramatic change of mission. Before 9/11, terrorism was viewed primarily as a criminal matter. The FBI focused more on indicting terrorists after an attack than on stopping the attack in the first place. For example, after the terrorists targeted the World Trade Center in 1993, FBI agents succeeded in tracking down several of the killers. They obtained indictments against them and they put them behind bars.And that was good work. But eight years later al Qaeda returned to finish the job. Immediately after 9/11, the FBI made preventing terrorism its top priority. The FBI you join today is focused on collecting and analyzing intelligence -- so we can figure out what the terrorists are planning before it is too late. Over the past seven years, we have more than doubled the number of intelligence analysts and translators on the force. We've enacted the Patriot Act to ensure FBI analysts and investigators have the information they need to protect our nation. We created the FBI's new National Security Branch -- bringing together divisionsresponsible for counterterrorism and intelligence and counterespionage. The FBI you join today is working more closely with partners at all levels of government. At the local level, we've increased the number of FBI Joint Terrorism Task Forces from 35 to more than 100. These task forces bring together federal and local law enforcement agents. They have helped break up terror cells in places like Portland, Oregon; Buffalo, New York; andnorthern Virginia. At the national level, we created the National Counterterrorism Center, where the FBI is working side by side with the CIA, the Homeland Security Department, and other federal agencies to track terrorist threats and prevent new attacks. We created the TerrorismScreening Center to consolidate watch lists from different agencies into one master list. At the international level, we've deployed the FBI to foreign countries to help track down the terrorists. Since September the 11th, the FBI has opened 16 new offices overseas. Two of them are in Kabul and Baghdad -- where hundreds of FBI agents are serving alongside ourbrave men and women in uniform. The FBI can be proud of all these accomplishments. These changes were difficult, and they were necessary. We've transformed an agency founded a century ago to meet the challenges of the 21st century. And thanks to the vision and determination of the FBI, America is safertoday than we were on September the 11th, 2001. In the midst of this rapid change, we can be confident that one thing will never change -- and that is the character and courage of those who carry the badge. We see this character and courage in the story of an agent named Leonard Hatton. A bomb specialist for the FBI, Lenny had investigated terrorist attacks around the world. So when he saw smoke rising from the World Trade Center on September the 11th, 2001, he immediately understood the danger. With complete disregard for his own life, he ran to the scene to help others escape. And when the towers came crashing down, Lenny died beneath them. Earlier that same morning, Lenny had told his wife, ""Just another regular day at work."" Well, for a man like Lenny Hatton -- who always put others before himself -- it was another day at work. We must always honor the memory of this good and faithful servant -- and we vow that those who have given their livesin the war on terror shall never have died in vain. As new special agents, your charge to keep is to carry out this mission. I ask you to defend the values of fidelity, bravery, and integrity that you have learned here at this Academy. I ask you to carry out your duty to protect the lives and liberties of the American people. If you follow these principles, your careers will take you far, this agency will uphold its solemnresponsibility, and America's security will be in good hands. I want to thank you for sharing your graduation with me. I'm inspired by your examples of service. I wish you all the best in the future. May God bless you.",bush
"Good morning. Last night, I had a warm conversation with President-elect Barack Obama. I congratulated him and Senator Biden on their impressive victory. I told the President-elect he can count on complete cooperation from my Administration as he makes the transition to theWhite House. I also spoke to Senator John McCain. I congratulated him on a determined campaign that he and Governor Palin ran. The American people will always be grateful for the lifetime of service John McCain has devoted to this nation. And I know he'll continue to make tremendouscontributions to our country. No matter how they cast their ballots, all Americans can be proud of the history that was made yesterday. Across the country, citizens voted in large numbers. They showed a watching world the vitality of America's democracy, and the strides we have made toward a more perfect union. They chose a President whose journey represents a triumph of the Americanstory -- a testament to hard work, optimism, and faith in the enduring promise of our nation. Many of our citizens thought they would never live to see that day. This moment is especially uplifting for a generation of Americans who witnessed the struggle for civil rights with theirown eyes -- and four decades later see a dream fulfilled. A long campaign has now ended, and we move forward as one nation. We're embarking on a period of change in Washington, yet there are some things that will not change. The United States government will stay vigilant in meeting its most important responsibility -- protecting the American people. And the world can be certain this commitment will remain steadfastunder our next Commander-in-Chief. There's important work to do in the months ahead, and I will continue to conduct the people's business as long as this Office remains in my trust. During this time of transition, I will keep the President-elect fully informed on important decisions. And when the time comes on January the 20th, Laura and I will return home to Texas with treasured memories of our timehere -- and with profound gratitude for the honor of serving this amazing country. It will be a stirring sight to watch President Obama, his wife, Michelle, and their beautiful girls step through the doors of the White House. I know millions of Americans will be overcome with pride at this inspiring moment that so many have awaited so long. I know Senator Obama's beloved mother and grandparents would have been thrilled to watch the child they raised ascend the steps of the Capitol -- and take his oath to uphold the Constitution of thegreatest nation on the face of the earth. Last night I extended an invitation to the President-elect and Mrs. Obama to come to theWhite House. And Laura and I are looking forward to welcoming them as soon as possible. Thank you very much.",bush
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is a difficult moment for America. I, unfortunately, will be going back to Washington after my remarks. Secretary Rod Paige and [the] Lt. Governor will take the podium and discuss education. I do want to thank the folkshere at -- at Booker Elementary School for their hospitality. Today, we've had a national tragedy. Two airplanes have crashed into the World Trade Centerin an apparent terrorist attack on our country. I have spoken to the Vice President, to the Governor of New York, to the Director of the FBI, and have ordered that the full resources of the federal government go to help the victims and their families, and -- and to conduct a full-scale investigation to hunt down and to find thosefolks who committed this act. Terrorism against our nation will not stand. And now if you [would] join me in a moment of silence. May God bless the victims, their families, and America. Thank you very much.",bush
"Thank you all for coming. Mr. Vice President and Lynne, thank you for being here with us.Laura and I welcome you to the South Lawn -- better known as Barney's playground. I want to thank members of my Cabinet who've joined us. We've just finished a Cabinet meeting, and it gave me a chance to tell them how much I appreciate the good work they'redoing during this critical time for our nation. I also appreciate the men and women who make up the Executive Office of the President for joining us today. Some of you have been at the White House for just a few months. Others arrived the same day that we did nearly eight years ago. You're the ones who can tell that my hair has gotten a little grayer. Others are career employees who have been here for 30, or40, sometimes 50 years. I can tell that your hair has gotten grayer. The people on this lawn represent diverse backgrounds, talents, and experiences. Yet we all share a steadfast devotion to the United States. We believe that service to our fellow citizensis a noble calling -- and the privilege of a lifetime. This is an exciting time for our country. Earlier this week, more than 120 million people voted for a new President and Congress -- one of the largest turnouts in the history of the country. No matter how we cast our ballots, this election gives us all reason to be proud of our democracy and our country. And I hope you will join Laura and me in congratulatingPresident-Elect Obama, and wishing him the very best for his family and our country. Just before our inauguration in 2001, Laura and I went back to Midland, Texas -- she was born there and I was raised there. I said that Laura and I would ""never quite settle in Washington."" I told them: ""While the honor is great, the work is temporary."" This is true for many of us here today. This peaceful transfer of power is one of the hallmarks of a true democracy. And ensuring that this transition is as smooth as possible is a priority for the rest of my presidency. We face economic challenges that will not pause to let a new President settle in. This will also be America's first wartime presidential transition in four decades. We're in a struggle against violent extremists determined to attack us -- and they would like nothingmore than to exploit this period of change to harm the American people. So over the next 75 days, all of us must ensure that the next President and his team can hit the ground running. For more than a year now, departments and agencies throughout the federal government have been preparing for a smooth transition. We've provided intelligence briefings to the President-Elect, and the Department of Justice has approved security clearances for members of his transition staff. In the coming weeks, we will ask administration officials to brief the Obama team on ongoing policy issues, ranging from the financial markets to the war in Iraq. I look forward to discussing those issues with the President-Elect early nextweek. Offices within the White House are at work preparing extensive transition materials. We're preparing career employees throughout the administration to take on added responsibilities tohelp prevent any disruption to the essential functions of the federal government. Taken together, these measures represent an unprecedented effort to ensure that the executive branch is prepared to fulfill its responsibilities at all times. As we carry out this transition I know that you will continue to conduct yourselves with the decency andprofessionalism you have shown throughout my time in office. A successful transition is just one of many important tasks remaining in our last 75 days. To help address the global financial crisis, the Secretary of Treasury is working endless hours, and I will host an international summit here in Washington on November the 15th. This will bea historic meeting -- and I'm confident that you will work hard to help make it a success. We'll also keep urging Congress to approve America's free trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. And we will continue to protect this homeland by defeating theterrorists and extremists abroad, so we do not have to face them here at home. As January 20th draws near, some of you may be anxious about finding a new job, or a new place to live. I know how you feel. But between now and then, we must keep our attention on the task at hand -- because the American people expect no less. Earlier this year, I promised that I would sprint to the finish. I am keeping that promise, and I know I have given some of you a good workout along the way. As we head into this final stretch, I ask you to remain focused on the goals ahead. I will be honored to stand with you at the finish line. May God bless you.",bush
"Thank  you.   Fellow  citizens,  for  eight  years  it  has  been  my  honor  to  serve  as  your  President.  The  first   decade  of  this  new  century  has  been  a  period  of  consequence,  a  time  set  apart.  Tonight,  with   a  thankful  heart,  I  have  asked  for  a  final  opportunity  to  share  some  thoughts  on  the  journey   that  we  have  traveled  together  and  the  future  of  our  nation.   Five  days  from  now,  the  world  will  witness  the  vitality  of  American  democracy.  In  a  tradition   dating  back  to  our  founding,  the  presidency  will  pass  to  a  successor  chosen  by  you,  the   American  people.  Standing  on  the  steps  of  the  Capitol  will  be  a  man  whose  history  reflects  the   enduring  promise  of  our  land.  This  is  a  moment  of  hope  and  pride  for  our  whole  nation.  And  I   join  all  Americans  in  offering  best  wishes  to  President  elect  Obama,  his  wife,  Michelle,  and   their  two  beautiful  girls.   Tonight,  I  am  filled  with  gratitude  to  Vice  President  Cheney  and  members  of  my   Administration    to  Laura,  who  brought  joy  to  this  house  and  love  to  my  life    to  our  wonderful   daughters,  Barbara  and  Jenna    to  my  parents,  whose  examples  have  provided  strength  for  a   lifetime.  And  above  all,  I  thank  the  American  people  for  the  trust  you  have  given  me.  I  thank   you  for  the  prayers  that  have  lifted  my  spirits.  And  I  thank  you  for  the  countless  acts  of   courage,  generosity,  and  grace  that  I  have  witnessed  these  past  eight  years. A R merican hetoric.com.       Copyright  2011.   Page  1   A  Am  me  er  ri  ic  ca  an  nR  Rh  he  et  to  or  ri  ic  c.  .c  co  om  m   This  evening,  my  thoughts  return  to  the  first  night  I  addressed  you  from  this  House,   September  the  11th,  2001.  That  morning,  terrorists  took  nearly  3,000  lives  in  the  worst  attack   on  America  since  Pearl  Harbor.  I  remember  standing  in  the  rubble  of  the  World  Trade  Center   three  days  later,  surrounded  by  rescuers  who  had  been  working  around  the  clock.  I  remember   talking  to  brave  souls  who  charged  through  smoke  filled  corridors  at  the  Pentagon  and  to   husbands  and  wives  whose  loved  ones  became  heroes  aboard  Flight  93.  I  remember  Arlene   Howard,  who  gave  me  her  fallen  son's  police  shield  as  a  reminder  of  all  that  was  lost.  And  I   still  carry  his  badge.  As  the  years  passed,  most  Americans  were  able  to  return  to  life  much  as   it  had  been  before  9/11.  But  I  never  did.  Every  morning,  I  received  a  briefing  on  the  threats   to  our  nation.  I  vowed  to  do  everything  in  my  power  to  keep  us  safe.   Over  the  past  seven  years,  a  new  Department  of  Homeland  Security  has  been  created.  The   military,  the  intelligence  community,  and  the  FBI  have  been  transformed.  Our  nation  is   equipped  with  new  tools  to  monitor  the  terrorists'  movements,  freeze  their  finances,  and   break  up  their  plots.  And  with  strong  allies  at  our  side,  we  have  taken  the  fight  to  the   terrorists  and  those  who  support  them.  Afghanistan  has  gone  from  a  nation  where  the  Taliban   harbored  Al  Qaeda  and  stoned  women  in  the  streets  to  a  young  democracy  that  is  fighting   terror  and  encouraging  girls  to  go  to  school.  Iraq  has  gone  from  a  brutal  dictatorship  and  a   sworn  enemy  of  America  to  an  Arab  democracy  at  the  heart  of  the  Middle  East  and  a  friend  of   the  United  States.   There's  legitimate  debate  about  many  of  these  decisions.  But  there  can  be  little  debate  about   the  results.  America  has  gone  more  than  seven  years  without  another  terrorist  attack  on  our   soil.  This  is  a  tribute  to  those  who  toil  night  and  day  to  keep  us  safe        law  enforcement   officers,  intelligence  analysts,  homeland  security  and  diplomatic  personnel,  and  the  men  and   women  of  the  United  States  Armed  Forces.   Our  nation  is  blessed  to  have  citizens  who  volunteer  to  defend  us  in  this  time  of  danger.  I   have  cherished  meeting  these  selfless  patriots  and  their  families.  And  America  owes  you  a   debt  of  gratitude.  And  to  all  our  men  and  women  in  uniform  listening  tonight:  There  has  been   no  higher  honor  than  serving  as  your  Commander  in  Chief.   The  battles  waged  by  our  troops  are  part  of  a  broader  struggle  between  two  dramatically   different  systems.  Under  one,  a  small  band  of  fanatics  demands  total  obedience  to  an   oppressive  ideology,  condemns  women  to  subservience,  and  marks  unbelievers  for  murder.   The  other  system  is  based  on  the  conviction  that  freedom  is  the  universal  gift  of  Almighty  God   and  that  liberty  and  justice  light  the  path  to  peace.   This  is  the  belief  that  gave  birth  to  our  nation,  and  in  the  long  run,  advancing  this  belief  is  the   only  practical  way  to  protect  our  citizens.  When  people  live  in  freedom,  they  do  not  willingly   choose  leaders  who  pursue  campaigns  of  terror.  When  people  have  hope  in  the  future,  they   will  not  cede  their  lives  to  violence  and  extremism.  So  around  the  world,  America  is  promoting   human  liberty,  human  rights,  and  human  dignity.  We're  standing  with  dissidents  and  young A R merican hetoric.com.

And  this  great  republic,  born  alone  in  liberty,  is   leading  the  world  toward  a  new  age  when  freedom  belongs  to  all  nations.   For  eight  years,  we've  also  strived  to  expand  opportunity  and  hope  here  at  home.  Across  our   country,  students  are  rising  to  meet  higher  standards  in  public  schools.  A  new  Medicare   prescription  drug  benefit  is  bringing  peace  of  mind  to  seniors  and  the  disabled.  Every  taxpayer   pays  lower  income  taxes.  The  addicted  and  suffering  are  finding  new  hope  through  face         faith  based  programs.  Vulnerable  human  life  is  better  protected.  Funding  for  our  veterans  has   nearly  doubled.  America's  air  and  water  and  lands  are  measurably  cleaner.  And  the  Federal   bench  includes  wise  new  members  like  Justice  Sam  Alito  and  Chief  Justice  John  Roberts.   When  challenges  to  our  prosperity  emerged,  we  rose  to  meet  them.  Facing  the  prospect  of  a   financial  collapse,  we  took  decisive  measures  to  safeguard  our  economy.  These  are  very  tough   times  for  hardworking  families,  but  the  toll  would  be  far  worse  if  we  had  not  acted.  All   Americans  are  in  this  together.  And  together,  with  determination  and  hard  work,  we  will   restore  our  economy  to  the  path  of  growth.  We  will  show  the  world  once  again  the  resilience   of  America's  free  enterprise  system.   Like  all  who  have  held  this  office  before  me,  I  have  experienced  setbacks.  And  there  are   things  I  would  do  differently  if  given  the  chance.  Yet  I've  always  acted  with  the  best  interests   of  our  country  in  mind.  I  have  followed  my  conscience  and  done  what  I  thought  was  right.  You   may  not  agree  with  some  of  the  tough  decisions  I  have  made.  But  I  hope  you  can  agree  that  I   was  willing  to  make  the  tough  decisions.   The  decades  ahead  will  bring  more  hard  choices  for  our  country,  and  there  are  some  guiding   principles  that  shape        should  shape  our  course.  While  our  nation  is  safer  than  it  was  seven   years  ago,  the  gravest  threat  to  our  people  remains  another  terrorist  attack.  Our  enemies  are   patient  and  determined  to  strike  again.  America  did  nothing  to  seek  or  deserve  this  conflict,   but  we  have  been  given  solemn  responsibilities,  and  we  must  meet  them.  We  must  resist   complacency.  We  must  keep  our  resolve.  And  we  must  never  let  down  our  guard.   At  the  same  time,  we  must  continue  to  engage  the  world  with  confidence  and  clear  purpose.   In  the  face  of  threats  from  abroad,  it  can  be  tempting  to  seek  comfort  by  turning  inward.  But   we  must  reject  isolationism  and  its  companion,  protectionism.  Retreating  behind  our  borders   would  only  invite  danger.  In  the  21st  century,  security  and  prosperity  at  home  depend  on  the   expansion  of  liberty  abroad.  If  America  does  not  lead  the  cause  of  freedom,  that  cause  will  not   be  led.   As  we  address  these  challenges        and  others  we  cannot  foresee  tonight        America  must   maintain  our  moral  clarity.

Murdering  the  innocent  to  advance  an  ideology  is  wrong  every  time,  everywhere.   Freeing  people  from  oppression  and  despair  is  eternally  right.  This  nation  must  continue  to   speak  out  for  justice  and  truth.  We  must  always  be  willing  to  act  in  their  defense  and  to   advance  the  cause  of  peace.   President  Thomas  Jefferson  once  wrote,  ""I  like  the  dreams  of  the  future  better  than  the   history  of  the  past.""  As  I  leave  the  House  he  occupied  two  centuries  ago,  I  share  that   optimism.  America  is  a  young  country,  full  of  vitality,  constantly  growing  and  renewing  itself.   And  even  in  the  toughest  times,  we  lift  our  eyes  to  the  broad  horizon  ahead.   I  have  confidence  in  the  promise  of  America  because  I  know  the  character  of  our  people.  This   is  a  nation  that  inspires  immigrants  to  risk  everything  for  the  dream  of  freedom.  This  is  a   nation  where  citizens  show  calm  in  times  of  danger  and  compassion  in  the  face  of  suffering.   We  see  examples  of  America's  character  all  around  us.  And  Laura  and  I  have  invited  some  of   them  to  join  us  in  the  White  House  this  evening.   We  see  America's  character  in  Dr.  Tony  Recasner,  a  principal  who  opened  a  new  charter   school  from  the  ruins  of  Hurricane  Katrina.  We  see  it  in  Julio  Medina,  a  former  inmate  who   leads  a  faith  based  program  to  help  prisoners  returning  to  society.  We  see  it  in  Staff  Sergeant   Aubrey  McDade,  who  charged  into  an  ambush  in  Iraq  and  rescued  three  of  his  fellow  Marines.   We  see  America's  character  in  Bill  Krissoff,  a  surgeon  from  California.  His  son  Nathan,  a   Marine,  gave  his  life  in  Iraq.  When  I  met  Dr.  Krissoff  and  his  family,  he  delivered  some   surprising  news:  He  told  me  he  wanted  to  join  the  Navy  Medical  Corps  in  honor  of  his  son.   This  good  man  was  60  years  old        18  years  above  the  age  limit.  But  his  petition  for  a  waiver   was  granted,  and  for  the  past  year  he  has  trained  in  battlefield  medicine.  Lieutenant   Commander  Krissoff  could  not  be  here  tonight,  because  he  will  soon  deploy  to  Iraq,  where  he   will  help  save  America's  wounded  warriors  and  uphold  the  legacy  of  his  fallen  son.   In  citizens  like  these,  we  see  the  best  of  our  country        resilient  and  hopeful,  caring  and   strong.  These  virtues  give  me  an  unshakable  faith  in  America.  We  have  faced  danger  and  trial,   and  there's  more  ahead.  But  with  the  courage  of  our  people  and  confidence  in  our  ideals,  this   great  nation  will  never  tire,  never  falter,  and  never  fail.   It  has  been  the  privilege  of  a  lifetime  to  serve  as  your  President.  There  have  been  good  days   and  tough  days.  But  every  day  I  have  been  inspired  by  the  greatness  of  our  country  and   uplifted  by  the  goodness  of  our  people.  I  have  been  blessed  to  represent  this  nation  we  love.

"Good morning. For the last eight years, I have had the honor of speaking to the American people Saturday mornings through this radio address. In hundreds of broadcasts, I have talked to you about important issues affecting our security and our prosperity. And today, inmy final address, I want to send a simple and heartfelt message: Thank you. Eight years ago, Laura and I left our home in Texas to come to Washington. Through two terms in the White House, we have been blessed by your kind words and generous prayers. We have been inspired by those of you who reach out to feed the hungry, clothe the needy, and care for the sick. We have been moved by the courage and devotion of those of you whowear the uniform. Serving as your President has been an incredible honor. Like every individual who has held this office before me, I have experienced setbacks. There are things I would do differently if given the chance. Yet I've always acted with the best interests of our country in mind. I have followed my conscience and done what I thought was right. You may not agree with some tough decisions I have made. But I hope you can agreethat I was willing to make the tough decisions. The decades ahead will bring more hard choices for our country, and there are some guiding principles that should shape our course. While our Nation is safer than it was seven years ago, the gravest threat to our people remains another terrorist attack. Our enemies are patient, and determined to strike again. America did nothing to seek or deserve this conflict. But we have been given solemn responsibilities, and we must meet them. We must resistcomplacency. We must keep our resolve. And we must never let down our guard. At the same time, we must continue to engage the world with confidence and clear purpose. In the face of threats from abroad, it can be tempting to seek comfort by turning inward. But we must reject isolationism and its companion, protectionism. Retreating behind our borders would only invite danger. In the 21st century, security and prosperity at home depend on the expansion of liberty abroad. If America does not lead the cause of freedom, that cause will notbe led. As we address these challenges -- and others we cannot foresee today -- America must maintain our moral clarity. I've often spoken to you about good and evil. This has made some uncomfortable. But good and evil are present in this world, and between the two there can be no compromise. Murdering the innocent to advance an ideology is wrong every time, everywhere. Freeing people from oppression and despair is eternally right. This nation must continue to speak out for justice and truth. We must always be willing to act in their defense - - and to advance the cause of peace. Eight years ago, on a cold January morning, I stood on the steps of the United States Capitol, placed my hand on the Bible, and swore a sacred oath to defend our people and our Constitution. On that day, I spoke of ""our nation's grand story of courage and its simple dream of dignity."" Next week, my term of service will come to an end -- but that story andthat dream will continue. On Tuesday, Laura and I will join all Americans in offering our best wishes to President Obama, his wife Michelle, and their two beautiful girls. And later that day, we will return to the love of family and friends in Texas. I will depart office proud of my Administration's record. And I will spend the rest of my life grateful for the opportunity to have served as President ofthe greatest nation on Earth. Thank you for listening.",bush

With the distance of a decade, 9/11 can feel like a part of a different era. But for the families of the men and women stolen, some of whom join us today, that day will never feel like history.

September the 11th, 2001, innocent men and women went to work at the World Trade Center. They reported for duty at the Pentagon. They boarded American Flights 11 and 77, United Flights 93 and 175. They did nothing to provoke or deserve the deliberate act ofmurder that al Qaeda carried out. One of the lessons of 9/11 is that evil is real, and so is courage. When the planes struck the World Trade Center, firefighters and police officers charged up the stairs into the flames. Asthe towers neared collapse, they continued the rescue efforts. Ultimately, more than 400 police officers and firefighters gave their lives. Among them was the chief of the New York City Fire Department, Peter Gancy. As a colleague put it, he wouldnever ask anyone to do something he didn't do himself. The Pentagon service members and civilians pulled friends and strangers from burning rubble. One special forces soldier recalls reaching through a cloud of smoke in search of the wounded. As he entered one room, he prayed to find someone alive. He discovered a severely burned woman and carried her to safety. They later met in the hospital, where she explained thatshe'd been praying for rescue. She called him her guardian angel. And then there's the extraordinary story we commemorate here. Aboard United Airlines Flight 93 were college students from California, an iron worker from New Jersey, veterans of the Korean War and World War II, citizens of Germany and Japan, a pilot who had rearranged hisschedule so that he could take his wife on a vacation to celebrate their anniversary. When the passengers and crew realized the plane had been hijacked, they reported the news calmly. When they learned that the terrorists had crashed other planes into targets on the ground, they accepted greater responsibilities. In the back of the cabin, the passengersgathered to devise a strategy. Copyright Restrictions Unknown. At the moment America's democracy was under attack, our citizens defied their captors by holding a vote. The choice they made would cost them their lives, and they knew it. Many passengers called their loved ones to say goodbye; then hung up to perform their final act. One said, ""They're getting ready to break into the cockpit. I have to go. I love you."" Anothersaid, ""It's up to us. I think we can do it."" In one of the most stirring accounts, Todd Beamer, a father of two with a pregnant wife with a home in New Jersey, asked the air phone operator to join him in reciting the Lord's Prayer.Then he helped lead the charge to the front of the plane with the words ""Let's roll."" With their selfless act, the men and women who stormed the cockpit lived out the words,""Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.""1 And with their brave decision, they launched the first counter offensive of the war on terror. The most likely target of the hijacked plane was the United States Capitol. We'll never know how many innocent people might have been lost, but we do know this: Americans are alive today because the passengers and crew of Flight 93 chose to act, and our nation will be forevergrateful. The 40 souls who perished on the plane left a great deal behind. They left spouses and children and grandchildren who miss them dearly. They left successful businesses and promising careers and a lifetime of dreams that they will never have the chance to fulfill. Theyleft something else: a legacy of bravery and selflessness that will always inspire America. For generations people will study the flight, the story of Flight 93. They will learn that individual choices make a difference, that love and sacrifice can triumph over evil and hate, and that what happened above this Pennsylvania field ranks among the most courageous actsin American history. The memorial we dedicate today will ensure our nation always remembers those lost here on 9/11. But we have a duty beyond memory. We have a duty beyond honoring. We have a duty to live our lives in a way that upholds the ideals for which the men and women gave their lives, to build a living memorial to their courage and sacrifice. We have a duty to find commonpurpose as a nation. Copyright Restrictions Unknown. In the days after 9/11, the response came like a single hand over a single heart. Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle gathered on the steps of the capitol and sang ""God blessAmerica."" Neighbors reached out to neighbors of all backgrounds and beliefs. The past decade, our country has been tested by natural disaster, economic turmoil, anxieties and challenges here at home and abroad. There have been spirited debates along the way. It's the essence of democracy. But Americans have never been defined by our disagreements. Whatever challenges we face today and in the future, we must never lose faith in our ability tomeet them together. We must never allow our differences to harden into divisions. Second, we have a duty to remain engaged in the world. 9/11 proved that the conditions in the country on the other side of the world can have an impact on our own streets. It may be tempting to think it doesn't matter what happens to a villager in Afghanistan or a child inAfrica, but the temptation of isolation is deadly wrong. World repression and anger and resentment will be a never ending source of violence and threats. A world of dignity and liberty and hope will be safer and better for all. The surest wayto move toward that vision is for the United States of America to lead the cause of freedom. Finally, we each have a duty to serve a cause larger than ourselves. The passengers aboard Flight 93 set an example that inspires us all. Many have followed their path of service by donating blood or mentoring a child or volunteering in desperate corners of the earth. Some have devoted their careers to analyzing intelligence or protecting our borders and securing ourskies. Others have made the noble choice to defend our nation in battle. For 10 years, our troops have risked and given their lives to prevent our enemies from attacking America again. They've kept us safe; they have made us proud; and they haveupheld the spirit of service shown by the passengers on Flight 93. Many years ago in 1863, another President came to dedicate a memorial site in this state. Hetold his audience that: In a larger sense we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow thisground. For the brave souls who struggled there, it consecrated it far above our poorpower to add or detract. Copyright Restrictions Unknown. He added, ""The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can neverforget what they did here."" So it is with Flight 93. For as long as this memorial stands, we will remember what the men and women aboard the plane did here. We'll pay tribute to the courage they showed, the sacrifice they made, and thelives they spared. The United States will never forget. May God bless you all. Copyright Restrictions Unknown.",bush
"Thank you all. As has been mentioned, in 2006 Laura and I came here to Warren EastonCharter High School a year after Katrina hit, and we are honored and pleased to be back inthe 10th anniversary of that devastating storm. I can   t think of a better place to come here inNew Orleans, except for some of the restaurants. The slogan that guided the school when we first visited is true today:    We believe in success.    And because of that success, that schools like this have achieved, you   ve given all Americansreason to believe that New Orleans is back and better than ever. Mr. Mayor, thank you for your hospitality. You and the First Lady have been so gracious tous, and we want to thank you for your leadership. If enthusiasm and a good strategy counts,New Orleans is going to be -- is in good hands. And we thank you very much. Copyright Restrictions Unknown. By the way, I do bring greetings from one of the co-chairmen of the Bush KatrinaFund: [President George H.W. Bush] 41. He had one of the great lines of all time. He said,   Who would have thought getting out of bed at age 91 would be more dangerous thanjumping out of an airplane at age 90?    I want to thank David Garland, President of the Warren Easton Charter Foundation Board. Iwant to thank all the folks who have shown up. As Laura said, we had a roundtablediscussion. Many of our friends were there, people we worked with. I think of NormanFrancis for example, one of the great leaders of New Orleans, one of the great minds of NewOrleans. In spite of the devastation, we have many fond memories. I remember sitting with [GeneralRussel L.] Honor   on top one of those big ships, strategizing. I think you were drinking; Iwasn   t of course. But it   s...great to see you. Surely, we   re honored that you took time tocome. Obviously, members of Congress, members of the State House, Superintendent White,on and on, thank you all for coming. I really want to thank the leadership of the school and we   ll talk about them here in a minute.Although I must confess, the Principal is always a teacher. So she tried to teach me how tosecond line with the band here at Warren Easton. I -- I know she didn   t say it, but she wasthinking,    This, this boy needs a lot of work.    So we   re thrilled with your hospitality. In a cruel twist, Hurricane Katrina brought despair during what should have been a season ofhope -- the start of the new school year. Students who had recently gone back to schoolsuddenly had no school to go back to. Many had nowhere to live. The floodwaters, as you allknow better than most, claimed schools and homes alike. As Laura mentioned, the stand --the ground we   re on today was underwater. All of us who are old enough to remember willnever forget the images of our fellow Americans amid a sea of misery and ruin. We   ll alwaysremember the lives lost across the Gulf Coast. Their memories are in our hearts and I hopeyou pray for their families. Hurricane Katrina is a story of loss beyond measure. It   s also a story of commitment andcompassion. I hope you remember what I remember, and that is 30,000 people were saved in theimmediate aftermath of the storm by U.S. military personnel, by Louisiana law enforcement,and by citizens who volunteered. Copyright Restrictions Unknown. I hope you remember what I remember, and that was the thousands who came here on avolunteer basis to provide food for the hungry and to help find shelter for those who had nohome to live in. There are people all around our country who prayed for you, many of whomshowed up so they could say they helped a fellow citizen who was hurting. One of the groups that stepped forward to serve were the educators of New Orleans. At atime when it would have been easy to walk away from the wreckage, the educators heretoday thought of the children who would be left behind. You understood that bringing NewOrleans back to life requires getting students back to school. And even though some of theeducators had lost almost everything you owned, you let nothing stand in your way. Today,we celebrate the resurgence of New Orleans    schools. We honor the resilience of a greatAmerican city whose levees gave out but whose people never gave up. Out of the devastation of Katrina, you vowed to do more than just open the schools. Youvowed to challenge the status quo. Long before the great flood, too many students in this citydrifted from grade to grade without ever learning the skills needed for success. Parents   lacked choices and the power to intervene. Principals and teachers lacked the authority tochart a more hopeful course. It was a system that stranded more than 60 percent of thestudents failing in schools. It was what I called ""the soft bigotry of low expectations.""1 The decisions made in the dark hours after Katrina sparked a decade of reform. Rather thanjust reopen the schools, we organized many into charter schools that are independentlyoperated but publicly accountable for achieving high standards. More than nine in ten publicschool students in this city now call [a] charter school home. Administrators at these schoolshave the freedom to slice through red tape and the freedom to innovate. Parents at theseschools have choices if dissatisfied. And the results at these schools have beenextraordinary. The reason we know is because we measure, and any attempt to undermineaccountability in our school system does a huge disservice to the students who go to theschools in New Orleans. According to the new report2 by the Cowen Institute, [the] percentage in New Orleans   students graduating on time has soared since Katrina. [The] percentage of students whoattended schools that score better than the state average almost doubled, and so has thepercentage of students meeting basic standards. And you   ve got to ask,    Why?    It just didn   thappen. A lot of it [was] structural, and a lot of it requires strong leadership -- people whostared into the eye of the storm and who refused to back down. And so Laura and I are herein New Orleans to remind our country about what strong leadership means, and we   re here tosalute the leaders. Copyright Restrictions Unknown. I think of Jenny Rious here at Warren Easton. After Katrina, Jenny left New Orleans and wasforced to leave New Orleans. She started a website called    Warren Easton in Exile.    The sitereunited students scattered across the country around a vision for returning to New Orleansand reopening this school. When Jenny returned to New Orleans, the first place she went wasnot her house. It was this school. And as she put it,    I would rather see my own house burndown than this school.    Jenny would give anything for Easton and today, we give teacherslike hers our sincere thanks. [It   s] amazing what happened in this city after the storm wiped out the school system. Educational entrepreneurs decided to do something about the devastation and the failure. I   ve met a lot of them when I was President, and subsequent to my presidency. NeeravKingsland is one such person. He took a leadership role at an organization called    NewSchools for New Orleans.    He worked with others to help launch dozens of new schools and toturn ideas in -- to reform into reality. In other words, this isn't a theoretical exercise. It   simportant for our country to look at New Orleans and realize this is an exercise ofimplementing a plan which works. He -- He, so Neerav was so encouraged by what he sees here that he -- he   s talking up thereforms to other cities around the country. Isn   t it amazing? The storm that nearly destroysNew Orleans, and yet now New -- New Orleans is the beacon for school reform. Neeravrepresent[s] the virtues that Bill Clinton and I had in mind when we announced the newPresidential Leadership Scholars program, and we   re honored that Neerav was among the firstclass of scholars. Achieving these results took librarians who salvaged their collections from wateringwreckage. Listen, I know something about librarians. I married one. I   m really proud of theLaura Bush Foundation. She   s talked about the Grants -- talked about Pam and Marshall. These are citizens who supported this Foundation who, if they   d been in New Orleans, theydidn   t stay very long. And yet, like many around the country, they care deeply about thefuture of this city. I hope the students here -- I   m really thrilled you   re here by the way andthank you for staying awake. I hope you realize the compassion of others in helping yourealize a good education. It turns out that every good school, a school that   s succeeding -- a school that' succeeding --and we know it   s succeeding, because we measure against other standards -- requires strongprincipals. And there   s no doubt that Lexi Medley is a strong leader. I love when she says --when she says,    If you fail, we fail. The student   s our product. We don   t believe in puttingout anything but the best.    Copyright Restrictions Unknown. In order to succeed, in order to lead properly, you   ve got to set high goals and highexpectations. And that   s what Lexi and this school have done. As you heard, this school hasgraduated 100 percent of its seniors for the past five years. Lexi, you   ve earned ouradmiration and our gratitude, along with our best wishes for a happy birthday tomorrow. It   s the stories of schools like this one and others that we see a determination to rebuild betterthan before. And it -- it's a spirit much stronger than any storm. It   s a spirit that   s liftedcommunities laid low by tornadoes or terrorist attacks. It   s a spirit that I saw in New Orleansten years ago, and that is very evident today. We see that spirit in the population that has ticked back up as families settle back down. Wesee it in the tourists who are drawn here not only by this city   s rich heritage but the new hotelrooms and restaurants. We see it in the spirit in Lauren LeDuff. As Laura mentioned --Lauren mentioned -- Laura and I first met her in 2006 when she was a senior at Easton. She's happy to be back at the school she loved -- She was happy to be back at the school sheloved at the time. And you know what she told me? She said,    I want to be a teacher.    Andhere she is as a member of this faculty, teaching English. I probably needed her when I wasin high school. When asked how students have overcome adversity, Lauren says,    We teachour kids to be resilient. That   s in the culture of this city.    Lauren's right. The resilience you teach at Warren Easton is the same resilience that this cityshowed the world in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. On this anniversary, the work of makinga stronger and more hopeful New Orleans goes on. You   ve achieved a lot over the last tenyears. And with belief in success, and a faith in God, New Orleans will achieve even more. The darkness from a decade ago has lifted. The Crescent City has risen again. And its bestdays lie ahead. Thank you for having me. 1 Phrase origin credited to Michael Gerson and perhaps first used in presidential candidate George W. Bush's Address to the NAACP.

"Thank you, Senator. I, too, am really pleased that President Obama and Mrs. Obama have come down to Dallas. I also want to welcome [the] vice president and Mrs. Biden; Mr. Mayor;Chief Brown; elected officials; members of the law enforcement community. Today the nation grieves, but those of us who love Dallas and call it home have had five deaths in the family. Laura and I see members of law enforcement every day. We count -- We count them as our friends. And we know, like for every other American, that their courage isour protection and shield. We   re proud of the men we mourn and the community that has rallied to honor them and support the wounded. Our mayor and police chief and our police department have beenmighty inspirations for the rest of the nation. Copyright Restrictions Unknown. These slain officers were the best among us: - Lorne Ahrens, beloved husband to detective Katrina Ahrens and father of two; - Michael Krol, caring son, brother, uncle, nephew, and friend; - Michael Smith, U.S. Army veteran, devoted husband, and father of two; - Brent Thompson, Marine Corps vet, recently married; - Patrick Zamarippa, U.S. Navy Reserve combat veteran, proud father, and loyal TexasRangers fan. With their deaths, we have lost so much. We are grief stricken, heartbroken, and forevergrateful. Every officer has accepted a calling that sets them apart. Most of us imagine if the moment called for, that we would risk our lives to protect a spouse or a child. Those wearing the uniform assume that risk for the safety of strangers. They and their families share theunspoken knowledge that each new day can bring new dangers. But none of us were prepared, or could be prepared, for an ambush by hatred and malice. Theshock of this evil still has not faded. At times it seems like the forces pulling us apart are stronger than the forces binding us together. Argument turns too easily into animosity. Disagreement escalates too quickly intode-humanization. Too often we judge other groups by their worst examples, while judging ourselves by our best intentions. And this has -- And this has strained our bonds of understanding and commonpurpose. Copyright Restrictions Unknown. But Americans, I think, have a great advantage. To renew our unity, we only need to remember our values. We have never been held together by blood or background. We arebound by things of the spirit, by shared commitments to common ideals. At our best, we practice empathy, imagining ourselves in the lives and circumstances ofothers. This is the bridge across our nation   s deepest divisions. And it's not merely a matter of tolerance, but of learning from the struggles and stories of ourfellow citizens and finding our better selves in the process. At our best, we honor the image of God we see in one another. We recognize that we are brothers and sisters, sharing the same brief moment on Earth and owing each other theloyalty of our shared humanity. At our best, we know we have one country, one future, one destiny. We do not want the unity of grief, nor do we want the unity of fear. We want the unity of hope, affection, and highpurpose. We know that the kind of just, humane country we -- we want to build, that we have seen in our best dreams, is made possible when men and women in uniform stand guard. At theirbest, when they   re trained and trusted and accountable, they free us from fear. The Apostle Paul said,    For God gave us a spirit not of fear, but of strength and love and self- control.   1 Those are the best responses to fear in the life of our country; and they   re the codeof the peace officer. Today, all of us feel a sense of loss -- but not equally. I   d like to conclude with the word of the families, the spouses, and especially the children of the fallen: Your loved one[   s] time with you was too short. They did not get a chance to properly say goodbye. But they went where duty called. They defended us, even to the end. They finished well. We will not forget whatthey did for us. Copyright Restrictions Unknown. Your loss is unfair. We cannot explain it. We can stand beside you and share your grief. And we can pray that God will comfort you with a hope deeper than sorrow and stronger thandeath. May God bless you. 1 2 Timothy 1: 7 Copyright Restrictions Unknown.",bush
"Laura has been very much engaged in this museum for a long time. She sits on the board.And we   re honored to be here. My first reaction is I hope all our fellow citizens come and look at this place. It is fabulous. Mr. President and First Lady, Vice President, Chief Justice; David [Skorton], thank you very much; the board. I do want to give a shout out to Lonnie [Bunch]. It   s really important to understand this project would not and could not have happened without his drive, his energy,and his optimism. Now, as Laura mentioned 15 years ago members from both part[ies] -- Congressman John Lewis and Sam Brownback, then-senator from Kansas -- informed me that they were about to introduce legislation creating a new museum to share the stories and celebrate theachievements of African Americans. You know, it would be fair to say that the Congress and I did not always see eye to eye -- if you know what I mean, Mr. President. But this is one issue where we strongly agreed. I was honored to sign the bill [H.R. 3442] authorizing the construction of this national treasure. AndI   m pleased it now stands where it has always belonged, on the National Mall. This museum is an important addition to our country for many reasons. Here are three. First, it shows our commitment to truth. A great nation does not hide its history. It faces its flaws and corrects them. This museum tells the truth that a country founded on the promiseof liberty held millions in chains, that the price of our union was America   s original sin. From the beginning, some spoke to truth -- John Adams, who called slavery an ""evil of Colossal Magnitude"" -- their voices were not heeded, and often not heard. But they were always known to a power greater than any on earth, One who loves His children and meantthem to be free. Second, this museum shows America   s capacity to change. For centuries, slavery and segregation seemed permanent, permanent parts of our national life -- but not to Nat Turner or Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks, or Martin Luther King Jr. All answeredcruelty with courage and hope. In a society governed by the people, no wrong lasts forever. After struggle and sacrifice, the American people, acting through the most democratic of means, amended the constitution that originally treated slaves as three-fifths of a person, to guarantee equal protection of the laws. After a decade of struggle, civil rights acts and voting rights acts were finally enacted. Even today, the journey toward justice is still not complete. But this museum will inspire us togo farther and get there faster. And finally, the museum showcases the talent of some of our finest Americans. The galleries celebrate not only African American equality, but African American greatness. I -- I can't help but note that -- [audience applause]. I cannot help but note that a huge influence in my teenage years is honored here, the great Chuck Berry; or my baseball idol growing up in far West Texas, the great Willie Mays. And of course, something I never really mastered, the ability to give a good speech, but Thurgood Marshall sure could. And some of you may know I   m a fledgling painter, a struggling artist. I have a new appreciation for the artists whose brilliant works are displayed here, people like RobertDuncanson, Henry Ossawa Tanner, Charles Henry Alston. Our country is better and more vibrant because of their contributions and the contributions of millions of African Americans. No telling of American history is neither complete nor accuratewithout acknowledging them. The lesson of this museum is all -- that all Americans share a past and a future by staying true to our principles, righting injustice, and encouraging the empowerment of all. We will bean even greater nation for generations to come. I congratulate all those who played a role in creating this wonderful museum. May God bless us all.",bush
"Freedom itself was attacked this morning by a faceless coward. And freedom will be defended. I want to reassure the American people that full -- the full resources of the federalgovernment are working to assist local authorities to save lives and to help the victims ofthese attacks. Make no mistake, the United States will hunt down and punish those responsible for thesecowardly acts. I've been in regular contact with the Vice President, Secretary of Defense, the nationalsecurity team, and my cabinet. We have taken all appropriate -- appropriate securityprecautions to protect the American people. Our military at home and around the world is on high alert status. And we have taken thenecessary security precautions to continue the functions of your government. We have been in touch with leaders of Congress and with world leaders to assure them thatwe will do what is -- whatever is necessary to protect America and Americans. I ask the American people to join me in saying a ""thanks"" for all the folks who have beenfighting hard to rescue our fellow citizens, and to join me in saying a prayer for the victimsand their families. The resolve of our great nation is being tested, but make no mistake. We will show the worldthat we will pass this test. God bless.",bush
"Today I am pleased to sign into law H.R. 5528, the Omnibus Indian Advancement Act. This Act is the product of lengthy negotiations among the Congress, my Administration, tribal governments and other interested parties. I commend all of the participants in these negotiations for their work in producing a bill that will benefit many Indian communities. This Act emphasizes my Administration's commitment to self-determination and self-governance of American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian people. In particular, the Act establishes an American Indian Education Foundation to encourage and accept private gifts to help further the education of Indian children attending Bureau of Indian Affairs schools in grades K-12; offers increased economic development opportunities for Indian tribes; authorizes new activities to help support and improve tribal governance, including the new Native Nations Institute at the Morris K. Udall Foundation; provides for the settlement of an historic land case in California; restores and reestablishes the Federal and trust relationship to two separate tribal groups; improves housing assistance to and affordable housing for Native Americans and Native Hawaiians; and includes other benefits and authorities for various American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian communities. Section 1104 of this bill raises a constitutional concern insofar as it could be read to interfere with my constitutional authority to determine when and whether to recommend legislation to the Congress. I will therefore treat it as precatory. This Act demonstrates our commitment to providing more support to the aboriginal peoples of this Nation. I am pleased to sign it into law. WILLIAM J.

"Warm greetings to everyone celebrating Christmas. At this joyous season each year, we savor our treasured Christmas traditions: a favorite ornament placed carefully on the tree, candles in the windows, a wreath on the door, family and friends gathered to exchange not only material gifts, but also the gifts of love and laughter. But amidst all these traditions, we remember that the true message of Christmas is in the Child whose birth we celebrate&mdash;the living proof of God's mercy and unending love. Christ's message of renewal and reconciliation is as fresh and powerful today as it was on that first Christmas two thousand years ago. For Americans of many faiths, this is a season of renewal&mdash;of light shining through the darkness, of despair transformed to hope. This year, Christmas is celebrated during the same week as Jews celebrate Hanukkah and Muslims celebrate the Eid Al-Fitr&mdash;a powerful and moving reminder that followers of the three Abrahamic faiths share fundamental values: a reverence for our Creator, a belief in human dignity, and a conviction that we must love our neighbors as ourselves. By building on these shared values, we can create a future where all God's children live together in peace and understanding. As Hillary, Chelsea, and I enjoy our last Christmas in the White House, we extend best wishes to all for a wonderful celebration and for peace and happiness in the years to come.

"A year ago today I announced the toughest air pollution standards for new cars and sport utility vehicles. Today we take another bold step to clean our air. We are adopting strong new measures to dramatically reduce unhealthy and unsightly emissions from trucks and buses powered by diesel fuel. Together, these actions represent the most sweeping effort ever to protect our air and our health from the pollution caused by the vehicles we drive. They ensure that by the end of the decade, every new car, truck, and SUV in America will be up to 95 percent cleaner than those on the road today. Today's action by the Environmental Protection Agency mandates cleaner diesel fuel and extends the latest pollution control technology to all trucks and buses for the first time. These advances will prevent not only the thick plumes of diesel exhaust all too familiar to motorists but also thousands of cases of respiratory illness and premature deaths. We will spare thousands of children and elderly the agony of asthma and bronchitis and help to fulfill the promise of clean, healthy air for every American. For the past 8 years, Vice President Gore and I have been guided by the conviction that a strong economy and a healthy environment go hand in hand. Indeed, our Nation entered the 21st century enjoying both unprecedented prosperity and the cleanest air and water in a generation. Our actions a year ago and today will help ensure an even safer and more prosperous future for generations yet to come.",clinton
"I am very pleased with the outcome of NATO's foreign ministers meeting in Brussels last week. Secretary Albright and her NATO colleagues reaffirmed the Alliance's commitment to peace, democracy, and respect for human rights throughout southeast Europe. They also reviewed the important progress we have made towards meeting our April 1999 Washington summit commitments&mdash;including improving our defense capabilities, increasing efforts against weapons of mass destruction, and reviewing the enlargement process at our next summit, to take place no later than 2002. I applaud the selection of Prague as the site for the next NATO summit. The Czech Republic under President Havel has been a driving force in the continued integration of Europe. Working closely with the EU, NATO also has advanced the goals we set at the Washington summit for strengthening European defense capabilities. I welcome the agreement at the EU's Nice summit to improve Europe's ability to act in times of crises and to put arrangements in place for close collaboration with NATO. NATO Defense and Foreign Ministers also acted to establish a strategic partnership with the EU. These efforts will strengthen NATO's European pillar, promote the EU's ability to manage crises where NATO is not engaged, and reinforce our transatlantic ties. We still have work to do to implement these arrangements and strengthen the habits of cooperation that have been NATO's hallmark since the end of the cold war. The United States looks forward to working with our European allies and partners to enhance our partnership and advance our common goals.",clinton

Mr. Robards was also a hero in his pre-acting days. Surviving the attack on Pearl Harbor, he earned the Navy Cross&mdash;the secondhighest naval decoration.

"I have withheld my approval of H.R. 2415, the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2000. I firmly believe that Americans would benefit from bankruptcy reform legislation that would stem abuse of the bankruptcy system by, and encourage responsibility of, debtors and creditors alike. Unfortunately, this bill is not balanced reform and it omits critical language to require accountability and responsibility from those who unlawfully bar access to legal health services. I hope the next Congress can work in a bipartisan spirit to enact balanced legislation. Over the past several months, my Administration has engaged in a good faith effort to reach agreement with the bill's proponents on a number of outstanding issues. With this goal in mind, we have pursued negotiations notwithstanding my deep concern that the bill failed to address some creditor abuses and also unnecessarily disadvantaged all debtors to stem abuses by a few. An agreement was reached in those negotiations on an essential issue&mdash;limiting homestead exemptions&mdash;with compromises made on both sides. Unfortunately, H.R. 2415 fails to incorporate that agreement, instead reverting to a provision that my Administration has repeatedly said was fundamentally flawed and contrary to the central premise of this legislation: that debtors who truly have the capacity to repay a portion of their debts do so. The agreement would have benefited not only those debtors' creditors but also all other debtors through lower credit costs. In contrast, the current bill's unlimited homestead exemptions allow debtors who own lavish homes to shield their mansions from their creditors, while moderate-income debtors, especially those who rent, must live frugally under rigid repayment plans for 5 to 7 years. This loophole for the wealthy is fundamentally unfair and must be closed. And the inclusion of a provision that limits&mdash;to some degree&mdash;a wealthy debtor's capacity to move assets before bankruptcy into a home in a State with an unlimited homestead exemption does not ameliorate the glaring omission of a real homestead cap. Moreover, I have made clear that bankruptcy legislation must require accountability and responsibility from those who unlawfully bar access to legal health services. Far too often, we have seen doctors, health professionals, and their patients victimized by those who espouse and practice violence at health care clinics. The Congress and the States have established remedies for those who suffer as a result of these tactics. However, we are increasingly seeing the use of the bankruptcy system as a strategic tool by those who seek to promote clinic violence while shielding themselves from personal liability and responsibility. It is critical that we shut down this abusive use of our bankruptcy system and prevent endless litigation that threatens the court-ordered remedies owed to victims of clinic violence. The Senate was right in its bipartisan vote of 80-17 to adopt an amendment that would effectively close down any potential for this abuse of the Bankruptcy Code. Nonetheless, this critical provision was dropped from the final bill without public debate, and I fail to understand why the bill's proponents refuse to include this consensus provision to shut down the use of bankruptcy to avoid responsibility for clinic violence. On the positive side, the bill would improve credit card disclosures&mdash;although more can and should be done&mdash;and impose limitations on misleading creditor practices that encourage debtors to reaffirm dischargeable debts on potentially unfavorable terms. However, these beneficial provisions are outweighed by the bill's flaws and omissions. I would have signed a balanced bankruptcy reform bill that addressed known abuses, without tilting the playing field against those debtors who genuinely turn to bankruptcy for a fresh start. I have withheld my approval of H.R. 2415 because it does not strike the right balance. WILLIAM J. CLINTON The White House, December 19, 2000.",clinton
"Sue, Christy, Carin, Maggie, other family and friends. I was sitting in this service listening to Chuck's family members, friends, partner speak about him, and I was thinking he'd be fairly embarrassed by all these attempts to canonize him. So they put one client on the program. I have been on the receiving end of all this wisdom you have been celebrating, and he always told me what he thought, especially when I did not want to hear it. Chuck Ruff became the White House Counsel at an unusual point in history, when the White House was in the hands of the Democratic Party and the Congress was in the hands of a particular wing of the Republican Party, and a lot of the work of the White House Counsel was generated by the attempts of Congress to turn every political difference into a legal issue. And Chuck had to be calm in the face of all of it: Attempts to prove that our policy on climate change, for example, was actually a secret socialist plot to destroy the free enterprise system; serious questions from a person who believed that a good form of criminal investigation was shooting bullets into a watermelon in his backyard. And Chuck never lost his cool, never lost his temper, and never let me entirely lose my sense of humor about what often was a patently absurd situation. And then there were the serious issues beneath all the rancor and back-and-forth. And every single day&mdash;every single day&mdash;I was so profoundly grateful that my Counsel was so strong and wise and good and that he believed so profoundly in our Constitution and rule of law. As others have said, he never sought the spotlight, but when the moment came, he certainly shined. Millions of Americans saw him at work, mind and spirit. He cared about justice. He taught it; he shared it; and he lived it. His whole life was about doing good and doing right. Others have commented on his propensity for doing two things at once. I liked that. He once said that he finally understood that he had been picked as the White House Counsel because he was the only person who was not distracted by my doing crossword puzzles when we reviewed our latest strategy in dealing with the congressional requests. He was famous in the West Wing for watching football and listening to opera at the same time. But really, that captures the best of who he was, a competitor with passion, equal parts grace and guts, someone determined to make the most of every moment. For those of us who knew and loved him, Chuck Ruff may have been in a wheelchair, but he had more moves than Magic Johnson or Michael Jordan, and when he heated up, he could hit any ball further than Tiger Woods, because he was so intensely committed to doing right and doing good. I also would like to say a special word of appreciation, in front of his family and friends, for the fact that, in spite of all of the highprofile things Chuck did as the White House Counsel, one of the things that I most appreciated was that he was always there for the people in the White House, especially for the young people. He was always there with a calming and reassuring word, even in the craziest of times. He could always help people stop and take a breath, listen a little better, think a little harder, gather up their energies, and go on. In a town so often contentious, it was truly amazing to be reminded that you can be civil and effective at the same time. I'd also like to thank him publicly for how much he loved the District of Columbia and how strongly he supported our administration's efforts to be a good neighbor and a good partner. Who can forget that he began his closing statement last year in the well of the Senate: My name is Charles Ruff. I'm from the District of Columbia. And we don't have a vote in the Congress of the United States. I wish, in a way, this platform today in this house of God could be shared by every person in the White House who loved him. And I wish so much that every person out there on the streets of Washington, DC, whom he loved could know just a portion of what he labored to do for them. The reason I was proud to have him as my White House Counsel is that he was not a power lawyer; he was a powerful lawyer for people who had no power. No matter what he was asked to do, he did it with grace and honor, as if that alone was what God put him on Earth to do. And for that I am profoundly grateful. Chuck Ruff left us far too soon. But you can hear in the words and see in the voice of every person who has spoken today that he is still here. I hope he thinks we did all right by him today. I hope he is pleased by this vast assemblage of people, because he certainly always did more than all right by all of us.",clinton
"At the Queluz Summit on May 31, 2000 the U.S. and EU made a commitment to help stem and roll back the spread of HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in Africa, and to address their severe economic, social and personal consequences. The scope of the problem requires a multi-faceted approach and the mobilisation of significant resources. As proof of this commitment, the U.S. and EU have dramatically increased financial resources dedicated to combating these scourges. Together we are now waging the battle against these diseases on all of the major fronts. The U.S. and EU agree that the response to HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria must be placed within a broad multisectoral framework of development aiming at the overall objective of alleviating poverty and to ensure a lasting impact of any specific action to combat HIV/ AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. The U.S. and EU call upon countries to address and incorporate fully the health and development implications of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in the elaboration of their poverty reduction strategies and programs. The U.S. and EU plan to coordinate among the appropriate institutions and organisations at the global and regional level in order to ensure that all aspects of the response are endorsed by relevant stakeholders. The U.S. and EU are working to ensure that governments, institutions and civil society, including NGOs and the private sector, fully participate in these efforts. Diplomatic Cooperation in Africa The U.S. and EU participate together in donor coordination groups across Africa, assessing local needs and capacities and developing diplomatic and public awareness strategies. U.S. and EU diplomats have successfully encouraged African leaders to speak openly about the threat of HIV/AIDS, to set national priorities, to establish high level governmental coordinating mechanisms, to establish broad health sector and action plans to strengthen regional, national and local capacity to deliver health services and treatment, and to commit resources. We are making great strides in ensuring that our diplomatic activities are responsive to the needs and priorities of host countries, and complement the activities of other donor partners. <ul <liRegular high-level coordination involving the U.S. and EU, other donors and host governments has been established in several African countries. Similar coordination is proposed throughout sub-Saharan Africa. </li </ul Development Assistance Cooperation The U.S. and the EU are working together in planning and implementing country activities that are responsive to the needs and priorities of countries and regions. This assistance is being placed within national and regional health and development frameworks. <ul type=disc<liThe U.S. and the EU are collaborating in sub-Saharan African countries to support health policies and activities aiming at preventing the expansion of the diseases and at caring for and supporting people with HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis and those close to them. </li<liThe U.S. and the EU are enhancing their support for national health and other sector plans and policies. This support can take the form of a general support, either direct or through budget, or by supporting specific elements of those plans and policies for combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, for example training, provision of commodities such as condoms and test kits, and improving access to interventions that reduce mother-to-infant HIV transmission. </li <liUnder the enhanced HIPC initiative, the U.S. and the EU will work together in close collaboration with national authorities of selected countries to identify mechanisms for the utilisation of debt relief towards comprehensive social programs responding to the challenge of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. </li <liThe U.S. and the EU will set up a working group to identify and take advantage of their respective comparative advantages in supporting procurement and the provision of technical assistance. </li</ul International Partnerships The U.S. and the EU jointly support multilateral HIV/AIDS initiatives such as UNAIDS and the International Partnership against AIDS in Africa. The U.S. and the EU continue to support the Roll Back Malaria Initiative and the Multilateral Initiative on Malaria, as well as coordinating our assistance to the Stop TB Initiative and the TB Coalition. The U.S. and the EU support new innovative partnerships to increase the availability and affordability of global public goods.

"The United States and the European Union share a common vision on the question of arms export controls. That is why we have decided to work jointly to encourage all arms exporting countries to adopt the principles and degree of transparency which we apply to our own exports. We are agreed that we have special responsibilities in this respect. Accordingly, together we will pursue the promotion of these principles with rigor and seriousness of purpose. The European Union expressed, very early on, its determination to promote common high-level standards in this field with the adoption in 1991 and 1992 by the Luxembourg and Lisbon European Councils of the first set of common criteria for arms exports. The adoption in 1998 of the EU Code of Conduct for arms exports was a new step forward as it introduced a mechanism for notifications and consultations, the only one of its kind. Since its entry into force in June 1998, the Code of Conduct has helped to increase significantly the level of transparency in arms exports and to promote convergence of the national arms export policies implemented by Member States. The European Union encourages other countries to adhere to the principles of the code of conduct and welcomes the fact that 17 countries have declared they would apply these principles to their own export decisions. The United States, for its part, maintains comprehensive national arms export control policies, including registration of manufacturers and exporters of defense articles and services subject to U.S. jurisdiction, wide-ranging controls on exports of defense services, manufacturing licenses, technical assistance and brokering transactions, rigorous case-by-case review of applications or other requests for approval, requirements for U.S. government consent for retransfers of U.S. origin defense articles and services, and effective enforcement measures including a vigorous program of pre- and post-shipment monitoring of U.S. arms transfers. The United States has also supported efforts to strengthen international and multilateral controls involving greater responsibility, transparency and restraint. The United States has welcomed and expressed its strong support for the principles embodied in the EU Code of Conduct for Arms Exports, which are consistent with the U.S. arms transfer policy criteria. In furtherance of these policies and efforts, the United States has recently proposed the development and negotiation of an international arms sales code of conduct as a means of promoting principles and practices of responsibility, transparency and restraint on a wider international scale. In deciding to collaborate in the promotion of these principles regarding arms exports, the United States and the European Union reaffirm the right of States to acquire the means of selfdefense, consistent with the UN Charter Implementation of stringent and responsible controls by exporting States is a sine qua non for the acceptable conduct of arms exports. The efficiency of such controls is enhanced by a close dialogue between the licensing authorities and the exporting companies. We reaffirm the fundamental importance we attach to the promotion of democracy and the respect for human rights. For this reason, we deem it crucial to avoid export of military equipment when there is reason to believe that it will be used for internal repression or violation of internationally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms. We also stress that arms transfers should not contribute to or result in excessive or destabilizing arms accumulations, regional instability, armed aggression, the precipitation, escalation or aggravation of internal or interstate conflicts, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and missiles capable of delivering them, international terrorism, or in arms diversion. We reiterate the fundamental importance of respect, by all countries, of international commitments, in particular arms embargoes imposed by the United Nations Security Council and other competent international bodies. Illicit trafficking and diversion of military equipment are also serious concerns. We will continue to exercise particular vigilance with regard to exports of small arms and light weapons. We adopted a joint declaration on Common Principles on Small Arms and Light Weapons, on December 17, 1999, which encompasses these standards. We support the Moratorium and the Code of Conduct adopted by ECOWAS in 1999 and assert our intention to respect the Moratorium's principles when examining export applications at the national level. In this context, the United States and the European Union have decided to act jointly to encourage all arms exporting countries to submit their export decisions to rigorous criteria and to greater transparency. In particular, we commit ourselves to promoting the highest possible standards of conduct and enhanced export control practices based on our shared principles of responsibility, transparency and restraint, including: <ul type=disc<liimplementation of stringent national controls over exports of arms and military equipment, and of related technologies; </li<liauthorization of exports of arms and military equipment, and of related technologies only after an in-depth review of the internal situation of the buyer country and of the regional context in order to assure that such exports are not likely to create or heighten internal tensions or conflicts, to be used for the violation of human rights, to threaten peace and regional stability, or be diverted or re-exported in undesirable conditions; and </li<lipromotion of transparency by regularly circulating public information at the national level on authorized arms transfers and supporting expanded transparency regarding arms exports in the competent international fora, including the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms, the OSCE and the Wassenaar Arrangement. </li</ulThe United States and the European Union affirm their commitment to work together to promote the aforementioned principles and enhanced export control practices.",clinton
"Today I am signing into law H.R. 4942, the Departments of Commerce, Justice, State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2001. I commend the Congress for approving a bill that provides critical funding for enforcing our Nation's laws, protecting our precious natural resources, promoting international peace, and supporting our diplomatic operations. Many portions of the Act are considerably improved compared to the previous House and Senate versions. I appreciate and commend the Congress for the many changes that have been made, including providing additional funding to finance the Lands Legacy program; to improve the health of our Nation's ocean fisheries; to help close the digital divide between our more and less affluent citizens; to improve trade compliance; to prosecute local firearms violations; to toughen our Nation's stance against cybercrime and terrorism; to provide additional law enforcement assistance to Native Americans; to fund peacekeeping requirements; and to improve worldwide embassy security. I applaud the Congress for providing over $430 million for the Department of Commerce's components of the Lands Legacy Initiative. This funding will help protect marine sanctuaries; support the new Northwestern Hawaiian Coral Reef Reserve and restore other coral reefs; expand estuarine research reserves; and promote recovery of Pacific coastal salmon runs through grants to western States and Tribes. The Act fully funds activities for the Pacific Salmon Agreement with Canada at $60 million and for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) work on Columbia River Basin salmon populations. Acceptable funding is also provided for a new climate observation initiative, a new education program with Minority Serving Institutions, and two smaller programs: Global Observations to Benefit the Environment and the Global Disaster Information Network. The Act takes an important step toward closing the digital divide by providing the requested tripling of funding for the Technology Opportunities Program. This program will provide grants to promote innovative applications of information technology in under-served communities. I am pleased that over $1.0 billion is provided for the COPS II/21st Century Policing initiative, the successor to the highly effective Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program, which will enable local police departments to begin a five-year plan to hire up to 50,000 additional community police officers, hire new community prosecutors, and expand communitybased prevention efforts. While the appropriated funding level is still below my original request, it is $444 million above the FY 2000 level, and will enable the COPS II program to fund almost 6,000 new officers in FY 2001. The Act provides almost $100 million for the Department of Justice's counterterrorism and cybercrime initiatives. This funding level will allow for improved efforts to meet the growing challenges of terrorism and cybercrime, including State and local first-responder training, staff support for the Joint Terrorism Task Forces and enhanced technology and intelligence-gathering along the northern border. The Department of Justice's components of the Gun Enforcement Initiative are funded at $103 million. This appropriation will support over 600 Federal, State and local gun prosecutors, and increase research on smart gun technologies. The Indian Country Law Enforcement initiative is funded at $111 million. This funding, which is $19 million above the FY 2000 level, will allow the Department of Justice to assist tribes in hiring and equipping law enforcement personnel, constructing detention and court facilities, and developing alternative sentencing programs for alcohol and substance abusers. I am pleased that the Act provides $4.7 billion for the regular operations of the Department of State, including diplomatic and consular programs; information technology investments; and, building leases, maintenance and repair. These funds will pay for support costs critical to maintaining the Department's network of overseas posts and the conduct of foreign affairs worldwide. The funded increases include expanded efforts to promote trade compliance and enhance labor and environmental monitoring. Funding for embassy security and construction also includes requested support for projects of the Agency for International Development. The Act also provides full funding for the Administration's pilot program to allow unclassified communication and sharing of information for all U.S. Government agencies operating at an overseas post, as recommended by the Overseas Presence Advisory Panel. The Act also provides $846 million for Contributions to International Peacekeeping Activities. Funding at this level will allow the United States to continue to support vital UN peacekeeping operations, including ongoing missions in Kosovo, East Timor, Ethiopia/Eritrea and Sierra Leone. I am also pleased that the Act provides $17 million for the Departments of Commerce and State and the United States Trade Representative to help ensure U.S. companies and workers receive the full benefits from the WTO and other bilateral agreements signed by the United States. This funding will help to put experts overseas to deal with compliance issues that continue to hinder fair access to markets, double staff focused on China and Japan, and strengthen antidumping/countervailing duty investigation capabilities. I am pleased that H.R. 4577, the Consolidated Appropriations bill, modifies immigration provisions included in this Act, and that the modified legislation will ease immigration restrictions on an estimated 700,000 immigrant families living in the United States. The provisions will extend section 245(i) until April 30, 2001, as opposed to January 14, 1998, under current law, to allow aliens (and their spouses and children) who apply for an adjustment of status or a labor certification to remain in the United States until such petition is approved. Additionally, the provisions will create a new, temporary non-immigrant visa for spouses and children of spouses of legal permanent residents and U.S. citizens seeking to enter the United States to await approval of legal permanent resident status for themselves (the V visa). The provisions will also allow certain individuals who were not granted amnesty under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 who are currently seeking such relief through the courts to apply for permanent residency. While I am disappointed that the legislation fails to eliminate the disparate treatment under our immigration laws sought for Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Hondurans, Haitians, and Liberians and does not provide any relief for deserving individuals affected by changes in the 1996 immigration law, it is the best compromise that could be reached after several rounds of intense negotiations. I am also pleased that the Consolidated Appropriations bill, once signed, will eliminate an objectionable provision in the Commerce/Justice/State Act that purports to protect citizens from the unauthorized sale or display of social security numbers but would not, in fact, provide privacy safeguards that are adequate. Although the funding levels in this Act are acceptable, I am troubled that several issues could not be resolved despite my Administration's best efforts during the final negotiations on the Act. Notably, the Act does not include new hate crimes protections, and fails to extend the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund. I strongly urge the next Congress to reconsider these actions in future legislation. In addition, this bill greatly restricts lowpower FM radio broadcast. Low power radio stations are an important tool in fostering diversity on the airwaves through community-based programming. I am deeply disappointed that Congress chose to restrict the voice of our nation's churches, schools, civic organizations and community groups. I commend the FCC for giving a voice to the voiceless and I urge the Commission to go forward in licensing as many stations as possible consistent with the limitations imposed by Congress. I also oppose language in the Act related to the Kyoto Protocol. The language is inappropriate because the Administration has no intent of implementing the Protocol prior to congressional ratification. The Act includes an additional number of provisions regarding the conduct of foreign affairs that raise serious constitutional concerns. My Administration's objections to these and other language provisions have been made clear in previous statements of Administration policy. I direct the agencies to construe these provisions to be consistent with the President's constitutional prerogatives and responsibilities and where such a construction is not possible, to treat them as not interfering with those prerogatives and responsibilities. Finally, section 629 of the Act amends the Interstate Horseracing Act of 1978 to include within the definition of the term interstate offtrack wager, pari-mutuel wagers on horseraces that are placed or transmitted from individuals in one State via the telephone or other electronic media and accepted by an off-track betting system in the same or another State. The Department of Justice, however, does not view this provision as codifying the legality of common pool wagering and interstate account wagering even where such wagering is legal in the various States involved for horseracing, nor does the Department view the provision as repealing or amending existing criminal statutes that may be applicable to such activity, in particular, sections 1084, 1952, and 1955 of Title 18, United States Code. Several essential modifications to this bill are contained in H.R. 4577, the Consolidated Appropriations bill. I am signing H.R. 4942 into law today because I believe the Act, as modified by H.R. 4577, will meet the overall needs and priorities of the American people. I urge the next Congress and my successor to continue to promote the needs of the American citizenry by pursuing resolution to the troublesome issues I have highlighted above. WILLIAM J.

"Thank you. Well, first, I want to thank Janlori Goldman for her wonderful remarks and for her ongoing work in the area of health privacy. I thank the representatives of the doctors, nurses, consumers, and privacy community who are here today and who add input into this effort. I would like to thank my great friend Senator Pat Leahy for being here and for his strong support of privacy issues in the United States Congress. As others have said, I want to thank the entire team of people who worked on this. They worked on this issue for months and months and months. They worked hard. Some of them worked, I might add, at great personal sacrifice to themselves, because of developments unrelated to this issue, to get this out, because they believe so strongly in what they were doing. And I also would like to thank my Chief of Staff, John Podesta, who has been a fanatic on this issue in the best sense. Now, I want to thank all the folks at HHS for&mdash;Donna Shalala went over just some of the things that we have done in this administration over the last 8 years, thanks to all of you at HHS. And she said you were beginning to feel like Nebraska. But look, there's a big difference. You know, they say that because of the 24hour news cycle, we're all in a permanent campaign. And when you're in a permanent campaign, it's hard to take the time to go to someplace you have no chance of winning&mdash;Nebraska&mdash;&mdash;or someplace you have no chance of losing&mdash;the HHS Building. Right? So&mdash;. I might say, just parenthetically, I had a wonderful time in Kearney, Nebraska, and in Omaha, and you would be amazed at all the letters I've gotten. I have already received more letters than I thought there were Democrats in the State of Nebraska. It was quite wonderful. So I'm grateful. I want to thank all of you, and especially Donna Shalala, for these last 8 years. I believe that Donna Shalala is a superb leader, a great administrator, always full of energy. You will be happy to know, and not surprised, that she has steadfastly defended the people who work at the Department of Health and Human Services in pitched battles at the White House over various issues. You guys have so much responsibility over so many things; every day you get a new chance to wreck an administration. The fact that you somehow managed to avoid doing so, and along the way to get us up to record levels of childhood immunization, to get the number of people without health insurance going down for the first time in a dozen years, to involve women and seniors in clinical trials to an unprecedented extent, to add 24, 25 years to the Medicare Trust Fund and 2.5 million kids to the ranks of insured, and do so many other things, to be a positive force in the welfare reform movement, is a real tribute to you, but I think, also, to Donna Shalala and her remarkable tenure as the leader of this Department. And she makes it fun, you know? Now she's going to become president of the University of Miami. We're just sort of a way station on her move south. She was at Wisconsin and then here and then going to Miami. I think you can confidently predict two or three things that will flow out of her tenure there: She will improve the academic quality of the institution; the football team will get even better&mdash;; and they will do whatever is necessary to clarify the voting procedures in Dade County. Look, we're having a good time today, but I want to take a moment to be very, very serious. We say that we are a free nation in a world growing increasingly free. And in so many ways, that is literally true. During the period in which I was President, I was fortunate enough to serve here at a time when, for the first time in all of human history, more than half the people on the globe live under governments of their own choosing. Now, that's a wonderful thing. That's one manifestation of freedom. Then, there's free speech, the freedom of the press, the right to travel, and also, I might add, minority rights of all kinds, restrictions on the ability of government to compromise the fundamental interests and rights of those who may not agree with the majority. But we must never forget, in this age of increasing interdependence, fueled by an explosion in information technology that is completely changing the way we work and live and relate to each other, that increasingly, we will have to ask ourselves: Does our freedom include privacy? Because there are new and different ways for that privacy to be restricted. In 1928 Justice Brandeis wrote his famous words saying that privacy was the right most valued by civilized people, and he defined it simply as the right to be left alone. Nothing is more private than someone's medical or psychiatric records. And therefore, if we are to make freedom fully meaningful in the information age, when most of our stuff is on some computer somewhere, we have to protect the privacy of individual health records. The new rules we release today protect the medical records of virtually every American. They represent the most sweeping privacy protections ever written, and they are built on the foundation of the bipartisan Kennedy-Kassebaum legislation I signed 4 years ago. This action is required by the great tides of technological and economic change that have swept through the medical profession over the last few years. In the past, medical records were kept on paper by doctors and stored in file cabinets by nurses; doctors and nurses, by and large, known to their patients. Seldom were those records shared with anyone outside the doctor's office. Today, physicians increasingly store them electronically, and they are now obliged to share those records in paper or electronic form with insurance companies and other reviewers. To be sure, storing and transmitting medical records electronically is a remarkable application of information technology. They're cost-effective; they can save lives by helping doctors to make quicker and better-informed decisions. But it is quite a problem that, with a click of a mouse, your personal health information can be accessed without your consent by people you don't know, who aren't physicians, for reasons that have nothing to do with your health care. It doesn't take a doctor to understand that that is a prescription for abuse. So, the rules that we release today have been carefully crafted for this new era, to make medical records easier to see for those who should see them and much harder to see for those who shouldn't. Employers, for instance, shouldn't see medical records, except for limited reasons, such as to process insurance claims. Yet, too often they do, as you just heard. A recent survey showed that more than a third of all Fortune 500 companies check medical records before they hire or promote. One large employer in Pennsylvania had no trouble obtaining detailed information on the prescription drugs taken by its workers, easily discovering that one employee was HIV positive. That is wrong. Under the rules we released today, it will now be illegal. There's something else that's really bothered me too, for years, and that is that private companies should not be able to get hold of the most sensitive medical information for marketing purposes. Yet, too often, that happens as well. Recently, expectant mothers who haven't even told their friends the good news are finding sales letters for baby products in their mailboxes. That's also wrong. And under these new rules, it will also be illegal. Health insurance companies should not be able to share medical records with mortgage companies who might be able to use them to deny you a loan. That actually happens today, but under these rules, it will be illegal. Health insurance companies shouldn't be able to keep you from seeing your own medical records. Up to now, they could. Under these rules, they won't be able to do that anymore. Under the rules being issued today, health plans and providers will have to tell you up front who will and won't be allowed to see your records. And under an Executive order I am issuing today, the Federal Government will no longer have free rein to launch criminal prosecutions based on information gleaned from routine audits of medical records. With these actions today, I have done everything I can to protect the sanctity of individual medical records. But there are further protections our families need that only Congress can provide. For example, only new legislation from Congress can make these new protections fully enforceable and cover every entity which holds medical records. So I urge the new Congress to quickly act to provide these additional protections. For 8 years now, I have worked to marry our enduring values to the stunning possibilities of the information age. In many ways, these new medical privacy rules exemplify what we have tried to do in this administration and how we have tried to do it. We can best meet the future if we take advantage of all these marvelous possibilities but we don't permit them to overwhelm our most fundamental values. I hope that these privacy rules achieve that goal. And again, let me say, for this and so much more, I am profoundly grateful to the people who work here at HHS, the people who work with them at OMB and in the White House. In this action, you have done an enormous amount to reassure and improve the lives of your fellow Americans. Thank you very much.",clinton
"For several years, we have been working with our east Asian allies to improve relations with North Korea in a way that strengthens peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. We have made substantial progress, including the 1994 Agreed Framework, which froze North Korea's production of plutonium for nuclear weapons under ongoing international inspections, and the 1999 moratorium on long-range missile tests. I believe new opportunities are opening for progress toward greater stability and peace on the Korean Peninsula. However, I have determined that there is not enough time while I am President to prepare the way for an agreement with North Korea that advances our national interest and provides the basis for a trip by me to Pyongyang. Let me emphasize that I believe this process of engagement with North Korea, in coordination with South Korea and Japan, holds great promise and that the United States should continue to build on the progress we have made. Our policy toward North Korea has been based on a strong framework developed at my request by former Secretary of Defense William Perry and carried out by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Special Adviser Wendy Sherman. We have coordinated each step forward with our allies the Republic of Korea and Japan. The engagement policy of President Kim Dae-jung and his personal leadership have spurred this process and earned the world's admiration. Taken together, our efforts have reduced tensions on the Korean Peninsula, improved prospects for enduring peace and stability in the region, and opened an opportunity to substantially reduce, if not eliminate, the threat posed by North Korean missile development and exports. This past October, when DPRK Chairman Kim Chong-il invited me to visit his country, and later when Secretary Albright traveled to Pyongyang, Chairman Kim put forward a serious proposal concerning his missile program. Since then, we have discussed with North Korea proposals to eliminate its missile export program as well as to halt further missile development. While there is insufficient time for me to complete the work at hand, there is sufficient promise to continue this effort. The United States has a clear national interest in seeing it through.",clinton
I welcome today's release of Edmond Pope after 8 months of detention in Russia and appreciate President Putin's decision to pardon Mr. Pope. Mr. Pope's ordeal was unjustified. It is fortunate that humanitarian considerations prevailed in the end. I admire the impressive support Mr. Pope received from his wife and family and from Congressman John Peterson of Pennsylvania and other Members of Congress. I commend their tireless efforts on his behalf.,clinton
"The growing reach of international crime poses threats to American citizens and American interests, both at home and abroad. Illegal activity from terrorism to trafficking in arms, drugs, or humans violates our values and threatens our safety. Intellectual property theft, financial fraud, and corruption also can endanger our prosperity and undercut public confidence in democracy and free markets around the world. To confront these challenges, today I am pleased to announce several important initiatives in our ongoing efforts to combat international crime. First, we are releasing a comprehensive International Crime Threat Assessment, prepared at my direction, as part of our International Crime Control Strategy adopted in May, 1998. The new assessment highlights the global dimensions of international crime and the ways this pervasive problem threatens U.S. interests. This broader understanding is necessary if we, together with our international partners, are to strengthen our response to this global problem. Second, earlier this week in Palermo, Italy, the United States joined many other countries in signing the United Nations Convention on Transnational Organized Crime, along with two supplementary protocols on migrant smuggling and trafficking in persons. By harmonizing criminal laws and promoting increased cooperation, the new convention and its protocols will enable the international community to better combat international organized crime. Third, the Departments of State and Justice are establishing a Migrant Smuggling and Trafficking in Persons Coordination Center. The Center will integrate and improve our efforts to counter these distinct but related global crime problems. The Center also will promote and assist increased efforts by foreign governments and international organizations to combat these problems. The United States is strongly committed to strengthening our international crime control programs to achieve a world of greater safety, prosperity, and justice. We urge the international community to join us in enhancing our common efforts to advance these common aims.",clinton
"Today I am pleased to sign into law S. 2943, the Assistance for International Malaria Control Act. In doing so, however, I note that section 405(b) of the Act purports to restrict the President's constitutional authority to appoint Officers of the United States by requiring that individuals be appointed to the Pacific Charter Commission only after consultation with specified members of the Congress and by requiring that not more than four of the appointees may be affiliated with the same political party. Because the work of the Commission may interfere with the constitutional authority vested in the President to conduct foreign affairs, the restrictions in section 405(b) are constitutionally problematic and I therefore construe these restrictions to be precatory only. WILLIAM J. CLINTON The White House, December 27, 2000.",clinton
"Thank you, Senator. Trying to get in practice, guys. I want to thank Victor and Katy and Barry and all the Special Olympics global messengers. Let's give them all a big hand again. Actually, I don't know whether I want to thank Victor or not. I understand that the very first time you played golf, you hit a ball 250 yards. And I want to know the secret before we go any further with this friendship of ours. I also want to thank our friend Jamie Lee Curtis, who has been a great master of ceremonies and has walked us all through this tonight. Let's give her a big hand&mdash;&mdash; and all the wonderful performers who have graced this stage tonight because they believe in Special Olympics. Hillary and I have been proud supporters of Special Olympics for many, many years, and we're proud to be part of this very special evening. Special Olympics is a program of sports, training, and competition, but ultimately it's a strong statement of optimism about human life. It says that every human being can learn and grow and contribute to the society we all share. It casts a spotlight on the dignity of human life and the beauty of the human soul. Special Olympics teaches us that when people with disabilities gain skill and confidence, we all win from their abilities. When Special Olympic athletes from America meet their counterparts from places like China and Botswana, people all over the world are enriched. And in this century, we have just begun. If we help Special Olympics establish global networks for families, create new health programs for athletes, and open new opportunity for 2 million athletes around the world, every one of us will be better off. Special Olympics began as a small flicker in the heart of one remarkable woman, Eunice Kennedy Shriver. We miss her tonight, and we thank Sarge and her whole family for being here. Special Olympics enters a new century, not a small flicker but a bursting flame of pride and a beacon of inspiration for every one of us. So tonight we celebrate what has been accomplished, and even more, we look forward to the future with determination and confidence. And now, I want all of our artists to get a big hand. They're back on the stage, and they're going to sing us&mdash;you know, I only have just a few days left&mdash;&mdash;so I'm going to take every opportunity I can to ask for everything I can. I want one more song. Merry Christmas, everybody.",clinton
"Good morning. Last night President-elect Bush and Vice President Gore showed what is best about America. In this election, the American people were closely divided. The outcome was decided by a Supreme Court that was closely divided. But the essential unity of our Nation was reflected in the words and values of those who fought this great contest. I was proud of both men. I pledged to President-elect Bush my efforts and the best efforts of every member of our administration for a smooth and successful transition. I want to say I am profoundly grateful to Vice President Gore for 8 extraordinary years of partnership. Without his leadership, we could not have made the progress or reached the prosperity we now enjoy and pass on to the next administration. I am also profoundly grateful to him for putting into words last night the feelings of all of us who disagreed with the Supreme Court's decision, but accepted it. And as he said, all of us have a responsibility to support Presidentelect Bush and to unite our country in the search for common ground. I wish President-elect Bush well. Like him, I came to Washington as a Governor, eager to work with both Republicans and Democrats. And when we reached across party lines to forge a vital center, America was stronger at home and abroad. The American people, however divided they were in this election, overwhelmingly want us to build on that vital center without rancor or personal attack. I thank the Members of Congress from both parties who have pledged to work with the President-elect. They have also pledged to elect commonsense bipartisan election reforms so that the votes of all citizens can be easily cast and easily counted in future elections. Finally, I want to thank the American people for their patience, passion, and patriotism throughout this extended election season. In the days of service left to me, I will do all I can to finish our remaining work with Congress and to help President-elect Bush get off to a good start. As I've said so many times over the last year, our country has never before enjoyed so much peace and prosperity with so few internal crises and so little external threat. We have the opportunity to build the future of our dreams for our children, and every one of us has an obligation to work together to achieve it. Thank you very much. # Mr. President, what do you say to Democrats who want to run on the election issue in 2 years? Do you think that's a way to take back the House? Well, I think, first of all, the election 2 years from now is difficult to predict, and it will take whatever shape it does. But for right now, we're in a period where we've had an election, but we haven't had the Inauguration. We have to ensure a smooth and constructive transition, and all of us should ensure that we do our part to give the President-elect his chance to do this job. And I would hope&mdash; and I believe that my fellow Democrats would be willing to do that, and I hope they will. I hope they will set a good example by getting off to a good start and trying to unite the country. Two years from now, what I hope will happen is that the honest differences that remain between the two parties will be the subject of a wholesome, vigorous, constructive debate, but that we will be moving further and further away from rancor. That, I think, is actually good for our party, because I think people do agree with us on the issues&mdash;on so many of the vital issues of the day. But I don't think that now is the time to do anything other than follow Vice President Gore's lead. He spoke for all of us last night, and he did it eloquently and well. And President-elect Bush responded with generosity in kind, I thought, in his remarks. And I think we ought to use this opportunity to let the country come together and try to get the new administration off to a good start. Thank you. # Mr. President, will your successor continue the special relationship you've enjoyed with Britain, do you hope? I can't imagine anybody who wouldn't do that. I think he will, yes. Thank you.",clinton
"Good morning. This week, as I work to conclude the last budget negotiations of my Presidency, I'm reminded how far we've come these past 8 years. We now live in a time of unprecedented peace and prosperity. But we didn't get there by accident. We made tough choices based on core values of opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and a community of all Americans. Today I want to talk about two elements critical to our continued success: first, our progress in moving people from welfare to work; and second, our continuing commitment to fiscal discipline and a budget that puts our people first. Vice President Gore and I took office in 1993 with a pledge to end welfare as we know it. Thanks to comprehensive welfare reform, a renewed sense of responsibility, and the strongest economy in a generation, millions of former welfare recipients now know the dignity of work. Today I am pleased to announce that over the past 8 years we've cut welfare caseloads by more than 8 million people. Last year alone 1.2 million parents on welfare went to work, determined to build better lives. Nationwide over the last 8 years, welfare rolls have dropped nearly 60 percent and now are the lowest in more than 30 years. We've been able to sustain this progress year after year because Government, the private sector, and welfare recipients themselves all have done their parts. Together, we are finally breaking the cycle of dependence that has long crippled the hopes of too many families. When we enacted landmark welfare reform in 1996, I insisted that Congress provide incentives to reward States for helping people to find jobs and to keep jobs. Today I'm pleased to announce that 28 States will receive a total of $200 million in bonuses for doing just that. These grants will enable States to help even more parents go to work and succeed on the job. I urge States to use these resources to provide the necessary support&mdash;from child care to transportation to training&mdash;that can make a critical difference between welfare checks and paychecks. We've also worked hard to help families leaving welfare meet the challenge of affordable health care. In the bipartisan budget package I will soon sign, we will extend Medicaid coverage so that thousands of parents who leave welfare can keep the health coverage protecting them and their children. This budget also includes funding to help cover more uninsured children, speed coverage for patients with Lou Gehrig's disease, and increase payments to hospitals, teaching facilities, home health agencies, and nursing homes in order to ensure quality health care. We have also secured an extra $817 million to help working families afford child care, to meet their responsibilities both at work and at home. These and other child care resources will serve over 2.2 million children next year. In this budget, we're also passing our historic new markets and community renewal initiative, the most significant effort ever to help hardpressed communities lift themselves up through private investment and entrepreneurship. With the help of our new-markets tax credit, 40 strengthened empowerment zones, and 40 renewal communities, this initiative will spur billions and billions of dollars in private investment to communities that have not yet shared in our Nation's great economic revival. From the streets of our central cities to the hills of Appalachia to the rugged vistas of our Native American reservations to the Mississippi Delta, we are giving people the tools of opportunity to make the most of their potential. Finally, this budget also includes vital investments in our children and their education. With over $900 million dedicated for the very first time to school renovation, thousands of local school districts finally will be able to give our children the classrooms they deserve. We've increased funding by 25 percent to stay on track to hire 100,000 highly qualified new teachers to reduce class size in the early grades. We have nearly doubled funding for after-school programs to help more than 1.3 million students, while increasing support for teacher training and for turning around failing schools. And to open the doors of college even wider so that more of our young people can walk through them, we've increased the maximum Pell grant to an all-time high of $3,750. That's up nearly $1,500 since 1993. If we continue to invest in our people and create opportunities for them, if we continue to honor and reward work, our possibilities are truly without limit. By reaching out and working together, our best days still lie ahead. This budget proves it. The work of the American people prove it. The successful desire of people to move from welfare to work proves it. Thanks for listening.",clinton
"Good morning. This weekend we not only celebrate the first Christmas of the new millennium; we also celebrate an America blessed with the gift of unprecedented prosperity and progress. We're in the midst of the longest economic expansion in our Nation's history, with record surpluses, more than 22 million new jobs, the lowest unemployment in history, and the lowest Hispanic- and African-American unemployment ever recorded. We have strengthened the cornerstone of the American dream along the way: the chance to own a home. Today, we have the highest homeownership in our Nation's history with record levels of minority homeownership. And more Americans than ever are celebrating that gift this holiday season. Over the last 8 years, Vice President Gore and I have worked hard to give nearly 10 million more families the opportunity to own their own homes by cutting redtape, speeding up loans, making financing available for families who were too often locked out of the market, creating more opportunity and choice for families who live in assisted housing. In the last 3 years, our administration has secured nearly 200,000 new housing vouchers to help hard-pressed families find decent and affordable housing. I want to especially thank our HUD Secretary, Andrew Cuomo, for his extraordinary commitment to making affordable housing accessible to citizens who need it most. Today we're introducing new measures to more fully integrate public housing, so families from different social and economic walks of life have the chance to live in diverse communities. In addition to expanding opportunity for more Americans, this will also help to break down destructive barriers of race and class. We're also taking action to increase loan limits from the Federal Housing Administration by nearly 9 percent to help more working families to own their first home. Since 1993, the FHA program has given more than 4 million Americans that chance. We have made real progress. But too many Americans still will be spending this Christmas without a roof over their heads. That's why we've helped to move thousands of families off the street. Yet, there still are more than a half million men, women, and children whose only home every night is a neighborhood shelter or a park bench. In this time of unparalleled prosperity, we must do more to help them. Today I'm pleased to announce $1 billion in new grants to help more than 200,000 homeless people along the path to self-sufficiency. This is the largest amount ever dedicated to helping homeless Americans rebuild their lives. The grants will fund proven successful programs like Continuum of Care, which helps homeless families with transitional and permanent housing, drug treatment and medication, job training, and child care. It also funds efforts like the Emergency Shelter Grants program, which provides for transitional housing and helps communities maintain emergency shelters. Taken together, these grants are a gift that will give back to us in many ways. They will empower communities to employ innovative solutions to helping homeless adults and their children, people like Juanita Price, a recovering drug addict who once spent her nights in abandoned buildings and hollowed-out cars. Thanks to the Continuum of Care program, Juanita found the support she needed and turned her life around. Today, she's got a steady job, an apartment, and she's studying to be a nurse at Howard University here in Washington, DC. There are lots and lots of people like Juanita who could use a helping hand. Today we're lending that hand by giving more homeless Americans the tools they need to succeed, so that this Christmas they can find warmth inside a home, not from the top of a steam grate. It is said in the Scripture: I will appoint a place for my people so they may dwell in a place of their own and move no more. Today, in this season of hope and giving, we should redouble our efforts to ensure that every American can have a place of his or her own. The steps we're taking now will create new opportunity for the homeless, for hard-pressed working families, and for those struggling to buy their first home. I can't think of any better way to celebrate this holiday season. Thanks for listening.",clinton
"Governor Richards, Chairman Brown, Mayor Dinkins, our great host, my fellow delegates and my fellow Americans, I am so proud of Al Gore.He said he came here tonight because he always wanted to do the warm-up for Elvis. Well, I ran for President this year for one reason and one reason only: I wanted to come back to this convention and finish that speech I started four years ago.Last night Mario Cuomo taught us how a real nominating speech should be given. He also made it clear why we have to steer our ship of state on a new course. Tonight I want to talk with you about my hope for the future, my faith in the American people, and my vision of the kind of country we can build together.<PI salute the good men who were my companions on the campaign trial: Tom Harkin , Bob Kerrey , Doug Wilder , Jerry Brown , and Paul Tsongas .<POne sentence in the Platform we built says it all. The most important family policy, urban policy, labor policy, minority policy, and foreign policy America can have is an expanding entrepreneurial economy of high-wage, high-skilled jobs.And so, in the name of all those who do the work and pay the taxes, raise the kids, and play by the rules, in the name of the hardworking Americans who make up our forgotten middle class, I proudly accept your nomination for President of the United States.<PI am a product of that middle class, and when I am President, you will be forgotten no more.We meet at a special moment in history, you and I. The Cold War is over. Soviet communism has collapsed and our values -- freedom, democracy, individual rights, free enterprise- they have triumphed all around the world. And yet, just as we have won the Cold War abroad, we are losing the battles for economic opportunity and social justice here at home.Now that we have changed the world, it's time to change America.<PI have news for the forces of greed and the defenders of the status quo: Your time has come and gone. Its time for a change in America.Tonight 10 million of our fellow Americans are out of work, tens of millions more work harder for lower pay. The incumbent President says that unemployment always goes up a little before a recovery begins, but unemployment only has to go up by one more person before a real recovery can begin. And Mr. President, you are that man.<PThis election is about putting power back in your hands and putting government back on your side. It's about putting people first.You know, I've said that all across the country, and when I do, someone always comes back to me, as a young man did just this week at a town meeting at the Henry Street Settlement on the Lower East side of Manhattan.<PHe said, That sounds good, Bill, but you're a politician. Why should I trust you?<PTonight, as plainly as I can, I want to tell you who I am, what I believe, and where I want to lead America.I never met my father. He was killed in a car wreck on a rainy road three months before I was born, driving from Chicago to Arkansas to see my mother.<PAfter that, my mother had to support us, so we lived with my grandparents while she went back to Louisiana to study nursing. I can still see her clearly tonight through the eyes of a three-year-old, kneeling at the railroad station and weeping as she put me back on the train to Arkansas with my grandmother.<PShe endured that pain because she knew her sacrifice was the only way she could support me and give me a better life. My mother taught me. She taught me about family and hard work and sacrifice. She held steady through tragedy after tragedy, and she held our family - my brother and I - together through tough times.<PAs a child, I watched her go off work each day at a time when it wasn't always easy to be a working mother.<PAs an adult, I watched her fight off breast cancer, and again she has taught me a lesson in courage. And always, always, always she taught me to fight.<PThat's why I'll fight to create high-paying jobs so that parents can afford to raise their children today.<PThat's why I'm so committed to make sure every American gets the health care that saved my mother's life and that women's health care gets the same attention as men's.That's why I'll fight to make sure women in this country receive respect and dignity, whether they work in the home, out of the home, or both.You want to know where I get my fighting spirit? It all started with my mother. Thank you, Mother. I love you.When I think about opportunity for all Americans, I think about my grandfather. He ran a country store in our little town of Hope. There was no food stamps back then, so when his customers, whether they were White or Black who worked hard and did the best they could, came in with no money, well, he gave them food anyway. He just made a note of it. So did I.Before I was big enough to see over the counter, I learned from him to look up to people other folks looked down on.My grandfather just had a high school education- a grade school education- but in that country store he taught me more about equality in the eyes of the Lord than all my professors at Georgetown, more about the intrinsic worth of every individual that all the philosophers at Oxford, more about the need for equal justice under the law than all the jurists at Yale Law School.If you want to know where I come by the passionate commitment I have to bringing people together without regard to race, it all started with my grandfather.I learned a lot from another person too: a person who for more than 20 years has worked hard to help our children, paying the price of time to make sure our schools don't fail them. Someone who traveled our state for a year, studying, learning, listening, going to PTA meetings, school board meetings, town hall meetings, putting together a package of school reforms recognized around the Nation, and doing it all while building a distinguished legal career and being a wonderful, loving mother.<PThat person is my wife.<PHillary taught me. She taught me that all children can learn and that each of us has a duty to help them do it.<PSo if you want to know why I care so much about our children, and our future, it all started with Hillary. I love you.Frankly, I am fed up with politicians in Washington lecturing the rest of us about family values. Our families have values. But our government doesn't.I want an America where family values live in our actions, not just in our speeches. An America that includes every family. Every traditional family and every extended family. Every two parent family. Every single-parent family. And every foster family. Every family.I do want to say something to the fathers in this country who have chosen to abandon their children by neglecting their child support: Take responsibility for your children or we will force you to do so. Because governments don't raise children; parents do. And you should.And I want to say something to every child in America tonight who is out there trying to grow up without a father or a mother: I know how you feel. You are special too.<PYou matter to America. And don't you ever let anybody tell you can't become whatever you want to be. And if other politicians make you feel like you are not part of their family, come on and be part of ours.The thing that makes me angriest about what has gone wrong in the last 12 years is that our government has lost touch with our values, while our politicians continue to shout about them. I'm tired of it!I was raised to believe the American Dream was built on rewarding hard work. But we have seen the folks of Washington turn the American ethic on its head.<PFor too long those who play by the rules and keep the faith have gotten the shaft, and those who cut corners and cut deals have been rewarded.People are working harder than ever, spending less time with their children, working nights and weekends at their jobs instead of going to PTA and Little League or Scouts. And their incomes are still going down. Their taxes are still going up. And the costs of health care, housing and education are going through the roof.Meanwhile, more and more of our best people are falling into poverty even though they work 40 hours a week.Our people are pleading for change, but government is in the way. It has been hijacked by privileged private interests. It has forgotten who really pays the bills around here. It has taken more of your money and given you less in return. We have got to go beyond the brain-dead politics in Washington and give our people the kind of government they deserve, a government that works for them.A President ought to be a powerful force for progress. But right now I know how President Lincoln felt when General McClellan wouldn't attack in the Civil War. He asked him, If you're not going to use your army, may I borrow it?And so I say: George Bush, if you won't use our power to help America, step aside. I will.Our country is falling behind. The President is caught in the grip of a failed economic theory. We have gone from first to 13th in the world in wages since Ronald Reagan and Bush have been in office.<PFour years ago, candidate Bush said, America is a special place, not just another pleasant country somewhere on the UN Roll Call between Albania and Zimbabwe. Now under President Bush, America has an unpleasant economy struck somewhere between Germany and Sri Lanka.And for most Americans, Mr. President, life's a lot less kind and a lot less gentle than it was before your administration took office.Listen, do it some more.<POur country has fallen so far so fast that just a few months ago the Japanese prime minister actually said he felt sympathy for the United States. Sympathy. When I am your President , the rest of the world will not look down on us with pity but up to us with respect again.What is George Bush doing about our economic problems?<PNow, four years ago he promised 15 million new jobs by this time, and he's over 14 million short. Al Gore and I can do better.He has raised taxes on the people driving pickup trucks and lowered taxes on the people riding in limousines. We can do better.<PHe promised to balance the budget, but he hasn't even tried. In fact, the budgets he has submitted to Congress nearly doubled the debt. Even worse, he wasted billions and reduced our investments in education and jobs. We can do better.So if you are sick and tired of a government that doesn't work to create jobs, if you're sick and tired of a tax system that's stacked against you, if you're sick and tired of exploding debt and reduced investments in our future, or if, like the great civil rights pioneer Fannie Lou Hamer, you're just plain old sick and tired of being sick and tired , then join us, work with us, win with us, and we can make our country the country it was meant to be.Now, George Bush talks a good game, but he has no game plan to rebuild America, from the cities to the suburbs to the countryside, so that we can compete and win again in the global economy. I do.He won't take on the big insurance companies and the bureaucracies to control health costs and give us affordable health care for all Americans, but I will.He won't even implement the recommendations of his own commission on AIDS, but I will.He won't streamline the federal government and change the way it works, cut 100,000 bureaucrats and put 100,000 new police officers on the streets of American cities, but I will.He's never balanced a government budget, but I have 11 times.He won't break the stranglehold the special interests have on our elections and the lobbyists have on our government, but I will.He won't give mothers and fathers the simple chance to take some time off from work when a baby is born or a parent it sick, but I will.We're losing our farms at a rapid rate, and he has no commitment to keep family farms in the family, but I do.He's talked a lot about drugs, but he hasn't helped people on the front line to wage that war on drugs and crime. But I will.He won't take the lead in protecting the environment and creating new jobs in environmental technologies for the 21st century, but I will. And you what else? He doesn't have Al Gore, and I do.<PJust in case you didn't notice, that's Gore with an E on the end.<PAnd George Bush- George Bush won't guarantee a women's right to choose; I will.<PListen. Here me now. I am not pro-abortion; I am pro-choice, strongly. I believe this difficult and painful decision should be left to the women of America.I hope the right to privacy can be protected and we will never again have to discuss this issue on political platforms. But I am old enough to remember what it was like before Roe v. Wade, and I do not want to return to the time when we made criminals of women and their doctors.Jobs, education, health care- these are not just commitments from my lips; they are the work of my life.Our priorities must be clear; we will put our people first again. But priorities without a clear plan of action are just empty words. To turn our rhetoric into reality we've got to change the way government does business, fundamentally. Until we do, we'll continue to pour billions of dollars down the drain.<PThe Republicans have campaigned against big government for a generation, but have you noticed? They've run this big government for a generation and they haven't changed a thing. They don't want to fix government; they still want to campaign against it, and that's all.But, my fellow Democrats, its time for us to realize we've got some changing to do too. There is not a program in government for every problem, and if we want to use government to help people, we have got to make it work again.Because we are committed in this Convention and in this Platform to making these changes, we are, as Democrats, in the words that Ross Perot himself spoke today, a revitalized Democratic Party.I am well aware that all those millions of people who rallied to Ross Perot's cause wanted to be in an army of patriots for change. Tonight I say to them, join us, and together we will revitalize America.Now, I don't have all the answers, but I do know the old ways don't work. Trickledown economics has sure failed. And big bureaucracies, both private and public, they've failed too.<PThat's why we need a new approach to government, a government that offers more empowerment and less entitlement. More choices for young people in the schools they attend- in the public schools they attend. And more choices for the elderly and for people with disabilities and the long-term care they receive. A government that is leaner, not meaner; a government that expands opportunity, not bureaucracy; a government that understands that jobs must come from growth in a vibrant and vital system of free enterprise.<PI call this approach the New Covenant, a solemn agreement between the people and their government based not simply on what each of us can take but what all of us must give to our Nation.We offer our people a new choice based on old values. We offer opportunity. We demand responsibility. We will build an American community again. The choice we offer is not conservative or liberal. In many ways, it is not even Republican or Democratic. It is different. It is new. And it will work. It will work because it is rooted in the vision and the values of the American people.<POf all the things that George Bush has ever said that I disagree with, perhaps the thing that bothers me most is how he derides and degrades the American tradition of seeing and seeking a better future. He mocks it as the vision thing.But just remember what the Scripture says: Where there is no vision, the people perish.I hope nobody in this great hall tonight, or in our beloved country has to go through tomorrow without a vision. I hope no one ever tries to raise a child without a vision. I hope nobody ever starts a business or plants a crop in the ground without a vision. For where there is no vision, the people perish.One of the reasons we have so many children in so much trouble in so many places in this nation is because they have seen so little opportunity, so little responsibility, so little loving, caring community, that they literally cannot imagine the life we are calling them to lead.And so I say again: Where there is no vision, America will perish. What is the vision of our New Covenant?<PAn America with millions of new jobs and dozens of new industries, moving confidently toward the 21st century.<PAn America that says to entrepreneurs and businesspeople: We will give you more incentives and more opportunity than ever before to develop the skills of your workers and to create American jobs and American wealth in the new global economy. But you must do your part, you must be responsible. American companies must act like American companies again, exporting products, not jobs.That's what this New Covenant is all about.<PAn America in which the doors of colleges are thrown open once again to the sons and daughters of stenographers and steelworkers. We will say: Everybody can borrow money to go to college. But you must do your part. You must pay it back, from your paychecks or, better yet, by going back home and serving your communities.Just think of it. Think of it. Millions of energetic young men and women serving their country by policing the streets or teaching the children or caring for the sick. Or working with the elderly and people with disabilities. Or helping young people to stay off drugs and out of gangs, giving us all a sense of new hope and limitless possibilities.<PThat's what this New Covenant is all about.An America in which health care is a right, not a privilege , in which we say to all of our people: Your government has the courage finally to take on the health care profiteers and make health care affordable for every family. But you must do your part. Preventive care, prenatal care, childhood immunization- saving lives, saving money, saving families from heartbreak.<PThat's what the New Covenant is all about.<PAn America in which middle-class incomes, not middle-class taxes, are going up.<PAn America, yes, in which the wealthiest few, those making over $200,000 a year, are asked to pay their fair share.An America in which the rich are not soaked, but the middle class is not drowned, either.Responsibility starts at the top.<PThat's what the New Covenant is all about.<PAn America where we end welfare as we know it. We will say to those on welfare: You will have, and you deserve, the opportunity, through training and education, through child care and medical coverage, to liberate yourself. But then, when you can, you must work, because welfare should be a second chance, not a way of life.That's what the New Covenant is all about.<PAn America with the world's strongest defense, ready and willing to use force when necessary.<PAn America at the forefront of the global effort to preserve and protect our common environment- and promoting global growth.<PAn America that will not coddle tyrants, from Baghdad to Beijing.An America that champions the cause of freedom and democracy from Eastern Europe to Southern Africa- and in our own hemispheres, in Haiti and Cuba.<PThe end of the Cold War permits us to reduce defense spending while still maintaining the strongest defense in the world, but we must plow back every dollar of defense cuts into building American jobs right here at home. I know well that the world needs a strong America, but we have learned that strength begins at home.But the New Covenant is about more than opportunities and responsibilities for you and your families. It's also about our common community.<PTonight every one of you knows deep in your heart that we are too divided. It is time to heal America.And so we must say to every American: Look beyond the stereotypes that blind us. We need each other - all of us - we need each other. We don't have a person to waste, and yet for too long politicians have told the most of us that are doing all right that what's really wrong with America is the rest of us- them.<PThem, the minorities. Them, the liberals. Them, the poor. Them, the homeless. Them, the people with disabilities. Them, the gays.<PWe've gotten to where we've nearly them'ed ourselves to death. Them, and them, and them.But this is America. There is no them. There is only us.One nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.That is our Pledge of Allegiance, and that's what the New Covenant is all about.How do I know we can come together and make change happen? Because I have seen it in my own state. In Arkansas, we are working together, and we are making progress. No, there's no Arkansas Miracle, but there are a lot of miraculous people. And because of them, our schools are better, our wages are higher, our factories are busier, our water is cleaner and our budget is balanced. We're moving ahead.I wish I could say the same thing about America under the incumbent President. He took the richest country in the world and brought it down.We took on of the poorest states in America and lifted it up.And so I say to all of those, in this campaign season who would criticize Arkansas, come on down. Especially if you're from Washington, come on down.Sure, you'll see us struggling against some of the problems that we haven't solved yet, but you'll also see a lot of great people doing amazing things, and you might even learn a thing or two.In the end, my fellow Americans, this New Covenant simply asks us all to be Americans again- old-fashioned Americans for a new time. Opportunity, responsibility, community.<PWhen we pull together, America will pull ahead. Throughout the whole history of this country, we have seen, time and time and time again, that when we are united we are unstoppable.We can seize this moment, make it exciting and energizing and heroic to be American again. We can renew our faith in each other and in ourselves. We can restore our sense of unity and community.<PAs the Scripture says, our eyes have not yet seen, nor our ears heard, nor minds imagined what we can build.But I can't do this alone. No President can. We must do it together. It won't be easy, and it won't be quick. We didn't get into this mess overnight, and we won't get out of it overnight. But we can do it- with commitment, creativity, diversity and drive.We can do it. We can do it.We can do it. We can do it. We can do it.<PI want every person in this hall and every person in this land to reach out and join us in a great new adventures, to chart a bold new future.<PAs a teenager, I heard John Kennedy's summons to citizenship. And then, as a student at Georgetown, I head that call clarified by a professor name Carol Quigley, who said to us that America was the greatest Nation in history because our people had always believed in two things- that tomorrow can be better than today and that every one of us has a personal moral responsibility to make it so.That kind of future entered my life the night our daughter, Chelsea, was born. As I stood in the delivery room, I was overcome with the thought that God had given me a blessing my own father never knew- the chance to hold my child in my arms.<PSomewhere at this very moment a child is being born in America. Let it be our cause to give that child a happy home, a healthy family and a hopeful future. Let it be our cause to see that that child has a chance to live to the fullest of her God-given capacities.Let it be our cause to see that child grow up strong and secure, braced by her challenges but never struggling alone, with family and friends and a faith that in America, no one is left out; no one is left behind.Let it be our cause that when this child is able, she gives something back to her children, her community and her country. Let it be our cause that we give this child a country that is coming together, not coming apart, a country of boundless hopes and endless dreams, a country once again lifts its people and inspires the world. Let that be our cause our commitment and our New Covenant.My fellow Americans, I end tonight where it all began for me- I still believe in a place called Hope. God bless you, and God Bless America.",clinton
"I'd like to open our first meeting with a brief prayer. Our Heavenly Father, we thank you for the unique opportunity which has been given to us to serve our country to thy ends. Please be with us and guide us. Keep us humble and eager. And help us to proceed with wisdom. Amen. Well, good morning. I want to say again how very proud I am of all of you and how pleased I am to be off to what I think is quite a good start. And I think we have an enormous reservoir of good will out in the country and a fair amount of elbow room to face the issues that are before us. In the next several days we will have to make a lot of tough economic decisions that some of you have been more involved in than others&mdash;that everybody will be involved in. This should be a fairly good meeting today. I just wanted to make a few remarks and then introduce Mack McLarty and let him talk a little bit. First of all, we're going to have this Cabinet retreat, as you know, in a few days. And some of the issues that we might ordinarily hash out here over an hour or two I think would be better put off until that retreat. If I might begin with sort of a major substantive decision. I basically very much believe in teamwork. And I think that over time you make better decisions if you get good input from a reasonable number of people who have different perspectives. Therefore, for example, when I was Governor, I didn't have a lot of Cabinet meetings, but I had a fair number in which people had the opportunity to comment on matters of public interest that were sometimes outside the narrow confines of what they were doing.",clinton
"Today I have signed into law H.R. 5630, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001. I am pleased that the Act no longer contains the badly flawed provision that would have made a felony of unauthorized disclosures of classified information, and that was the basis for my veto of a previous version of this legislation. I thank the Congress for working with me to produce a bill that I can sign. I appreciate the inclusion of section 308 concerning the applicability of Federal laws implementing international treaties and other international agreements to United States intelligence activities. Section 308 applies only to intelligence activities of the United States and addresses particular concerns regarding the potential application of future United States domestic laws implementing international agreements to otherwise lawful and appropriately authorized intelligence activities. This provision does not in any way address the proper interpretation of preexisting implementing legislation or other United States statutes, nor does it in any way address other United States Government activities. Title VIII of the Act sets forth requirements governing the declassification and disclosure of Japanese Imperial Army records, as defined by the Act. The executive branch has previously been declassifying United States Government records related to Japanese war crimes under the provisions of the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act, Public Law 105-246; consequently, I understand that title VIII does not apply to records undergoing declassification pursuant to the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act. Finally, I acknowledge the efforts of the Congress to bring about a more capable, secure, and effective Diplomatic Telecommunications System. I am concerned, however, that the proposed changes for the Diplomatic Telecommunications Service Program Office do not yet represent the best methods for improving the management of this system. As the executive branch implements this legislation, I encourage the Congress to work with the executive branch to consider alternatives for further improvements. WILLIAM J. CLINTON The White House, December 27, 2000.",clinton
"Thank you very much, my good friend James Roosevelt, who has likewise been an inspiration to me over the years, and who knows and cares a great deal about a subject that we must all come to grips with this year, the crisis in health care; to Senator Pat Moynihan, one of the most productive people in public life in the 20th century in America. And Mrs. Cuomo, I'm delighted to see you here, and we wish Governor Cuomo good health. He might have thought to himself, on deciding whether to do the responsible thing and take to his sick bed today, that he's probably heard this speech before and he's probably given it before. I can't tell you how grateful I am to your Governor for his support and his wise counseling. We had a delightful time in The White House, Hillary and I and Governor and Mrs. Cuomo, not very long ago. It's something I will treasure for a long time. I'm glad to see Lieutenant Governor Lundine and Attorney General Abrams and Members of the Congress, and members of both parties from the New York Assembly and State Senate, and people here who are here because you are Americans. You're Republicans, Democrats, independents. I am glad to see you all here in this monument to America's possibility. I wanted to come here for a thousand reasons, some of which are obvious. During the New York primary, which was successful in its conclusion but rather rough in its prelude on me- &mdash;I was absolutely enthralled by a book about President Roosevelt called The First Class Temperament written by a man named Jeffrey Ward. And I read a lot about Hyde Park. And the thing that moved me most was the way President Roosevelt came to grips with the fact of his polio and learned to live with it and learned to triumph over it and learned to use it to make himself stronger inside and not to be defeated by it. And ever since, I have been transformed from someone who had a mild interest in coming here to someone who had a burning passion to see this place. And I am honored to be here today. I want to say one more word, if I might, about Senator Moynihan because we've worked together over the years on a lot of things. I helped him to rewrite the welfare laws of our Nation in the late eighties and what he said was the most significant social welfare reform in 30 years, if only we could implement it. And one of the reasons I ran for President is to try to change the welfare system as we know it. I have watched him over more than two decades personally warn us about the decline of America's families, the development of a new and possibly permanent underclass in America, the importance of restoring the value of work to our social programs, a decade ago warning about the breakup of what was then the Soviet Union when most people thought that he was speaking a foreign language. And I can tell you that with leadership like his we can solve the problems this country faces today. I think of that because&mdash; &mdash;yes, you can give him a hand. That's good. We were about 45 or 50 minutes away from here when we landed in the airplane, and all along the way there were people, school children, hundreds of them, lining the way with their signs, and the young people at Marist College having even printed signs. Many people were young; some were older. A lot of them were terribly young. Most of them were, I'd say, between '20 and 50, anyway. That's young to me, you know. I find myself redefining that word every year. And there are all kinds of incredible things: Get the U.S. fit, one sign said. I want to give something to my country, another said. One I might have to give a trip to the doctor. It said, I want to pay more taxes. I couldn't believe that. One sign said, Shake 'em up, Bill. One sign said, Give Bill a chance. One said, Turn my country around. Another said, I've got a B.A. and no job; I'm ready to change. Another said, Just do something. Then, of course, there were a few that weren't so favorable, but that's all right. That's what this country's all about, too. But I couldn't believe the number of people who were there. And I say that because as much as anything else, I think our country now is infused with a new sense of possibility. One of the things that really used to depress me as I crossed America last year was the look I saw in so many people's eyes of skepticism, almost a painful unwillingness to believe that we can make things better, that we could change, that we could come to grips with the challenges of our time and overcome them and move forward. One of the things that I think&mdash;perhaps the most important thing that was achieved in the last election year was we had a huge increase in turnout, an even bigger increase among younger people. And now every day the White House switchboard and the mailroom are fuller than they have been in decades and decades because people believe that it matters again. This country has been kept going through two centuries now because of the peculiar mix of the energy of its people at the grassroots level and the vision of its leaders. But if you have one without the other, the country can't go forward. There have been times in the past when leaders have foreseen the future and known what needed to be done, but there was no connection with the people and so nothing could happen. There have been many times, I'm convinced, when the people have been ahead of their leaders. But if they had no visionary leaders, nobody to put all that energy together with the levers of public authority, nothing happened. We all hope, I think, from whatever perspective we come, that we now have a moment in our history where we have the energy of the people and a direction we can take. I ran for President because I believe this was a critical moment in our country's history. And there have been many over the last two centuries. I think of the Founding Fathers, who actually welded a nation out of 13 independent colonies when many people&mdash;maybe if you'd even taken a poll, a majority of the people would have said, Who wants one army? Who wants one currency? Who wants to really give up all this independence we have in New York or South Carolina? What do we have in common with those people down there? I think of Thomas Jefferson. Some people thought he was crazy when he ponied up $15 million to buy something then called the Louisiana Purchase, which most Americans could not even imagine and hardly anyone had ever seen. And if he hadn't done it, since I live on the edge of the Louisiana Purchase, you'd be listening to somebody from somewhere else give this speech today.I think of Abraham Lincoln. We now take it for granted that the Union would be preserved, that the slaves would be freed, that all this would happen. The truth is that a great many people thought there was no way to hold this Nation together. And a great deal of what did it was his vision and his sheer will. I think of President Roosevelt in the depths of the Depression, having gone through his personal journey to cope with his personal problems, summoning interior strength and reserve to lift the Nation's vision and to make people believe again that by taking one step at a time, by coming and building a beautiful school like this with the WPA&mdash;that if you did enough things like this and you just kept trying long enough, sooner or later we would go forward, we would work our way out of it by what he called then bold, persistent experimentation. Today, I think we need that kind of experimentation based on the plain evidence that we are in a rut. What we have been doing is not working to deal with the problems we face. For about two decades, through administrations of both parties' Presidents, we've been steadily moving into a global economy which is much more competitive, where other countries have been growing more rapidly than we and moving toward our standard of living, where we have to compete in all forms of economic life in ways that can force us to endure real pain, as you folks in this part of the country have seen recently with the difficulties that a magnificent company, IBM, has been forced to come to grips with. This is not an isolated event. This is part of the passage of time and the economic realities in which we live. That global economy abroad has presented us with a lot of challenges and a lot of opportunities here. But our ability to deal with it has been limited by a lot of the educational and training and social problems we have here at home, our racial and ethnic and income diversity, the high rates of violence and the whole pockets of poverty we have in this country, and lack of investment. We have seen that there are a lot of things that are just not quite fitting very well. And now we've had two decades in which the wages of most Americans have been stagnant compared to inflation. And when you look at the rising cost of education, health care, housing, the tax burden, most Americans are working harder today than they were 10 years ago for real, disposable income that is less, because of these sweeping trends. For 12 years, we have tried a clear approach to our country's problems. When President Reagan was elected in 1980, he ran with a clear sense of what he wished to do. He said, The Government is the problem here. It causes inflation. It causes middle-class people to have trouble. What we need is a very restricted role for Government. And we will also lower taxes on everybody, but most of all on the wealthiest Americans. Because if we give them their money back, they will invest it in America, create jobs, drive up incomes, increase jobs, and we will be the most prosperous country in the world. Well, I believe that free enterprise is the engine of growth in America. We are fundamentally a conservative, private, capitalist free enterprise country. But every other nation with which we compete decided to take a slightly different course. They said to themselves in Germany and Japan: Well, we're in a global economy in which the government and the people in the private sector have to work together. We've got to work together to train and educate our people as well as possible. We've got to work together to have economic policies that encourage investment over consumption so we can always be competitive. We've got to have a good trade policy, and we've got to do things that make it possible to create high-wage, high-growth jobs so that all the students who go to school here will have a future, and so that America will be strong. That's what I think we have to do. In other words, that is my vision. That is not what we have done. What we have done is to try for 12 years to cramp the role of Government. Now, look what's happened in practice. In practice, we have lowered taxes on the wealthiest Americans. Taxes on the middle class have actually gone up in the last 12 years. We have run a horrendous Government deficit. The deficit is now 4 times as big as it was in 1980. We have seen spending go up in areas that the Government would have to move to control, mostly health care and then interest on the debt, because when the deficit gets bigger and bigger and bigger, you spend more money on the debt. So we have reduced investment, increased the debt, moved money upward so that there's been much more inequality of income distribution, but we have not seen the kind of investment that creates high-wage, high-growth jobs in the emerging technologies that guarantee a future for all the young people that live here and throughout our land. So I ran for President because I really believe we ought to try a different course. Not to blame past Presidents; if you look at what's happened in Washington, none of it could have happened if there hadn't been bipartisan support for the course and support in Congress as well as in the White House. This is not about blame. I want to simply take responsibility. And as I told the Congress the other night, if we turn this country around, I don't care who gets the credit for it, either. I just think the time has come to make a change. We have tried one thing 12 years. It obviously has problems. It is time to change. Now, what does that mean? Change for change sake is not good. What does it mean? It means to me that we should do the following things. First of all, the Government should pursue a policy of increasing investment in those things which contribute to a growing economy. What are those things? We should invest more than we are now and more toward what our competitors do, in the infrastructure of the country, in transportation and communications, in environmental cleanup, in those things which increase productivity and put people to work. It means we should do whatever it takes to educate people for a lifetime at very high levels, because the skill level of the work force is the single most important determinant of income and the capacity to grow new jobs rapidly as new areas of opportunity open up. It means that we should invest in partnership with the private sector in new technologies which will determine the future of the country. And it means we should not give up on those areas where we have a lead. And let me just give you two examples: One is in computer technology and information technology. That's why what's happening to some of our big companies is very disturbing and why I'm going to California this weekend to announce a new technology policy to try to revitalize this whole sector of our economy. I'll give you another example which doesn't affect New York much, but it affects our country desperately, and that is aerospace. Boeing just announced 23,000 layoffs when we know that aerospace jobs are growing in number worldwide, high-wage jobs. And we sat here for 10 years and let Europe put $26 billion into an airbus program, direct government subsidies, to throw Boeing workers, McDonnell-Douglas workers, and other aerospace workers in America out of work because we said, Well, we don't practice those kind of partnerships. So we have got to face the fact that we've taken a new direction. And finally, it means that we must reduce the Government's debt. Why? Because if the debt gets bigger and bigger and bigger, two bad things happen: Bad thing number one is the Congress spends more of your tax money every year paying interest on the debt rather than investing in your future. It's now up to 15 cents on the dollar. If we do not change present spending patterns&mdash;when you hear people oppose the program I outline, ask them what the cost of the status quo is. If we behave for 4 more years like we have for the last 12, here's what will happen: By the end of the decade, the deficit will be $650 billion a year, and we'll be spending about 22 cents of every one of your tax dollars just paying interest on the debt. We'll be spending by then, because of the growth of health care costs, about 65 cents of your tax dollars on entitlements, and being in Congress will be a matter of how you spend 5 or 6 cents on every dollar. The rest of this will be just be rubber stamped. You can just have a computer instead of Congress. I know what you're thinking. Please don't say that. So, forgive me, Senator Moynihan, I had to say that. But you get it. I mean, it's squeezing the life out of the money you're giving up in taxes. The second reason, even more important, is the more money the Government borrows every year, the less money there is for people to borrow in the private sector and the higher the cost of the money is. Just since the election, since we made it clear that there was going to be a determined effort to lower the deficit, interest rates long-term have dropped considerably. I'll come back to this in a moment. But if you think about it, this year if we pass this budget, everybody in America who borrows long-term to finance a business, to finance a car, to finance a home, to finance credit card purchases, everybody that has access to variable interest rates will have those interest rates go down. And in my judgment, virtually everybody who has credit will save more money in lower interest costs than they will pay in higher taxes. Now, that's very, very important. Now, how are we going to do this? The first thing we have to do, and I mean the first, is to cut inessential Government spending. I've been President 4 weeks, and I've found things that I wouldn't have believed. The White House, when I became President, was running on Jimmy Carter's telephone system and Lyndon Johnson's switchboard in this&mdash;true&mdash;high-wage, this high-technology era, with a procurement system that would have broken Einstein's brain. There were a lot of things that needed to be changed in the Federal Government, and there still are. But in 4 weeks, we have cut the White House staff by 25 percent, starting at the beginning of the next fiscal year, and reorganized the White House so it will work more efficiently; not just cut but serve better. We have authorized in this budget administrative cuts in every Government Department, totaling 14 percent over the next 4 years for a savings of $9 billion. And there have been 150 specific cuts in Government programs, including programs that help a lot of good people but that I don't think we can afford at the present level anymore, programs like the two uranium enrichment facilities we have when we now know we only need one. And I was in one congressional district where one of those two facilities are this morning. You can say these cuts are not difficult, but when you look into the eyes of people who may be personally affected by them, they are, including reductions in the interest subsidies to the Rural Electrification Authority, something that brought electricity to my relatives in my State and which is still a very major force. Things that have some good in them, but we simply can't afford them. We've cut things out that have no good purpose anymore as far as I can tell, including a whole slew of commissions. Do you remember when we had the tall ships come into New York Harbor for the Bicentennial? That was a long time ago. Remember that? There's still a bicentennial commission. That's just one example. It's the funniest, but not the most costly. There are a lot of others. We have cut back on programs that involve subsidizing activities more than we should. The Superfund, for example, has, in my judgment, too much contribution from the taxpayer, too little from those who are responsible for the problem, and none of the money is being spent right. So far it's all going to lawyers. It's all going to lawyers. There is a program that I think helps a lot of wonderful people. It's a subsidy to sheep growers. You laugh. I asked Senator Moynihan if anybody in New York still raised sheep. We had sheep on the farm when I was a boy, so I'm more sensitive to this than some are. But when I got to studying this, we started to subsidize the sheep growers in World War I because we needed plenty of wool for uniforms. But the program is still on the books exactly as it was, not designed to help the small farmers stay in business, necessarily, but an across-the-board subsidy of that kind. So I recommended cutting it back. All these things have constituencies. But I can tell you, we are going to have to prove that we can cut things. When Roosevelt talked about bold, persistent experimentation, you know what an experiment is in science. It is trying out a new thesis. If it works, you incorporate it. You build on it. You go on to the next experiment. If it doesn't work, you quit. Government has a one-way experiment. We're very good at starting things and absolutely terrible at stopping them. So what we're going to try to do is start some new things. I want to fully fund Head Start. I want a big, new technology initiative. I want a big, new technology issue. I want to make it possible for every student in this country to borrow the money to go to college and then pay it back on favorable terms or work it off in national service, as teachers or police officers or working with kids in trouble. But we can't do that if we keep on doing everything we used to do. We have to stop doing some things we used to do to free up some money for things we should do. And we have to cut more in the past than we're going to spend in the future, because we have to use some of that money to reduce the deficit, too. So I ask you to support that. Now, in 4 weeks we found 150 specific cuts. As I said to the Congress the other night, in all good conscience to both the Republicans and the Democrats, I've just been there 4 weeks. Some of them have been there a lot longer than I have, and if anybody's got any other ideas, I'd like to have them. I just got started. You can look forward to more. I also think as I said in the campaign that we have to raise some more money. I now believe what I said might be true in the campaign, but I didn't think it was, that we have to raise it from a broader base than just people that make over $100,000, and I want to deal with that. After the election in December, the Government increased its estimates of our deficit by about $50 billion a year over the next 4 years. Now, if I had stayed with exactly the same plan that I recommended in the campaign, the first thing my critics who now attack me for raising taxes would say is, Oh, he's going to increase the deficit. Oh, he's being too optimistic. I decided that when they revised deficit figures up one more time $50 billion a year, that somebody had to take this thing and shake it up and say, We are definitely going to have a plan of spending cuts, new investments, and revenue increases that will bring this debt down. And I plead guilty to doing that. And I think almost any of you, if you had been in my circumstance, would have done the same thing if you were thinking about what was in the long-term best interest of the country. And you can see it by how much interest rates have come down just since the election. People who control these things desperately want to believe that our Government can exercise some discipline again, that we can have some focus, that we can show some restraint as well as some activity. Now, the taxes that I propose to raise&mdash;let me just basically go through them&mdash;are essentially three. There are more minor ones, but the big-ticket items are as follows: Number one, an increase in the income tax on the top 1.2 percent of income earners; an increase in the corporate income tax on corporations that have income in excess of $10 million a year. Number two, an increase in the income subject to taxation of people who draw Social Security but also have other income in excess of $32,000 a year if they're couples, or individuals in excess of $25,000 a year. In other words, anyone who is not paying tax on Social Security now will not pay tax under my plan. That's 80 percent of the Social Security recipients. The upper 20 percent will be asked to pay taxes on a higher percentage of their income, but we will still leave enough of that income free so that almost all of them will get back what they put into the Social Security system plus interest without taxation. The rest will be subject to the income tax. I think that is fair. Since 1985&mdash;I'm very proud of this&mdash;since 1985&mdash;as an American, you should be proud of it&mdash;the people of this country over 65 have had a lower poverty rate than people under 65. That's the good news. The bad news is that one in five American kids is living in poverty. So it seems to me that this is a fair thing to do under these circumstances. And then the third thing I recommended was an energy tax that will raise $20 billion a year and will help us to clean up the environment, promote conservation, and make us more independent of foreign oil. It is a broad-based tax to try to be fair to every part of the country. And I want to deal with this because I'm in New York now. There were some who said tax carbon, that's a fancy way of saying tax coal, which is very tough on West Virginia, Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, coal States that have been very hard hit. So I said no. There were others who said put a huge tax on gasoline, which is good for city dwellers but tough on people that live in the country and that live in those big western States where they have to drive very long distances and a carpool is not an option. So we said no. And some said tax the value of energy, which sounds great, except whenever one source of energy goes up the taxes go up. So you reinforce price increases. So we decided the most environmentally responsible and regionally fair way to do it was to tax the heat content of energy, oil, gas, coal in a very modest way, and then to have an offset over the next 4 years where any disproportionate impact in the Northeast for home heating oil, and real incentives for conversion. Now finally, let me say this program exacts no new taxes for the 40-plus percent of our income tax payers whose taxable income is under $30,000; about $20 a year for people at $30,000; goes up to something between $10 and $15 a month, depending on what your purchasing habits are, for people at $40,000. Seventy percent of it comes from people whose incomes exceed $100,000. There are also some other things here I want you to know about. This program has some tax incentives, which is a fancy way for saying tax cuts for people who invest their money: for the next 2 years, an investment tax credit for all businesses in America large and small who increase their rate of investment; then after that, some tax changes asked for by the manufacturing community for bigger businesses that will always encourage investment; and, for the first time, I think, ever, a small business investment tax credit that is a permanent 7-percent investment tax credit for the 90-plus percent of our businesses that operate on $5 million or less in revenues but create most of our new jobs. This is a very significant thing that will encourage the private sector to invest in job-generating activities and very important, because in every year of the 1980's, big business lost employment and small business overcame it with more new jobs; but for the last 2 1/2 years small business has not been creating enough jobs to offset the losses in big business. So we've got to reverse that. There's one final point I want to make as strongly as I can about this. Our plan will bring the deficit down dramatically over the next 4 years. In the 4th year, it will be $140 billion a year lower than it would otherwise be. But unless we also tackle the health care crisis this year, the deficits will start going up after that no matter what we do, because the cost of health care is going to overtake every other thing in the budget and swallow it whole, and not for new health care. We will be paying more for the same health care. So there is no more urgent item on our national agenda than getting all the people involved in health care together and trying to hammer it out. I asked the First Lady, as all of you know, to head a task force on this. She is increasingly less grateful to me for having asked her to do that. But she's very good at bringing people together on a complex matter and bringing them to conclusions and coming to a clear plan. And we have got to do that, or we can't turn this country's economic health around. You talk to any major manufacturer and ask them what their biggest problem is. Nine out of ten of them will tell you, my health care costs. You talk to the steel people and the auto people and ask them, and a lot of them will tell you, just paying the health care costs of our retirees. So we have to face that. Now, that's all of the bad news. Now, what's the good news? What are you going to get out of this? A half a million new jobs in the next year and a half in a job stimulus program, and a long-term program to raise our levels of investment and our quality of education and training, to be fairer to the lower income working people and create an environment that moves people from welfare to work, to have policies that really support families who are working and trying to raise children, and to have an investment program that breaks the barriers of new technologies and actually tries to create more new jobs than we are losing every year. No one can promise you, nobody, to stop anything bad from happening in this world. The world you're living in is so dynamic; there's going to be so many changes; no one can repeal the law of change. But change has been too many enemies for too many people. I seek to make change the friend of the American people. That's what this program does. It will make change our friend instead of our enemy. But we first have the courage. We must have the courage to seize control of our own destiny. So I want to say to you, just as I said to Congress the other night, I need your help. I can't do this alone. If you think there's something wrong with my program, fine. Come up with an alternative. But I promise you, the cost of the status quo is the most expensive course of all. Staying with what we've been doing is plainly unacceptable. Every American ought to be able to see that. The price is entirely too high. The price of my program is far lower with far higher results. I ask people of good will all across this country, just as I asked the Congress: If you can think of more things we can cut in spending that are really good for this economy and the American people over the long run, have at it. Let's go. I'm just getting started. I will not, I will not support any tax increase without the spending cuts. I'm not for that. I think we would also be very foolish to say that we don't need to invest more in our children and in our technology and in our economic future in putting the American people back to work. After all, the bottom line of all this is the chance that Americans need to have a dignified life. We are here in this beautiful school building today. It still looks fabulous after all these years because President Roosevelt knew it was wrong to let all those energetic, hard-working, family-oriented, God-fearing craftsmen and people who could work, sit idle month after month, year after year, when they had a contribution to make that would be good for themselves and good for the country. I ask you now to give me your support so that we can mobilize the energies of a whole generation of Americans. It will be good for you, but more important, it will be good for the country.Thank you very much.",clinton
"First of all, I want to thank you all for the introduction to your wonderful company. I want to thank Ed and Ken. We saw them last night with a number of other of the executives from Silicon Valley, people, many of them with whom I've worked for a good length of time, many of whom the Vice President's known for a long time in connection with his work on supercomputing and other issues. We came here today for two reasons, and since mostly we just want to listen to you, I'll try to state this briefly. One reason was to pick this setting to announce the implementation of the technology policy we talked about in the campaign, as an expression of what we think the National Government's role is in creating a partnership with the private sector to generate more of these kinds of companies, more technological advances to keep the United States always on the cutting edge of change and to try to make sure we'll be able to create a lot of good new jobs for the future. The second reason&mdash;can I put that down? We're not ready yet for this. The second reason I wanted to come here is, I think the Government ought to work like you do. And before that can ever happen we have to be able to get the people, the Congress, and the press, who have to interpret all this to the people, to imagine what we're talking about. I have, for example, the first State government in the country that started a total quality management program in all the departments of government, trying to figure out how we could reinvent the government. And I basically believe my job as President is to try to adjust America in good ways so that we can win in the 21st century, so that we can make change our friend and not our enemy. Ed said that you plan your new products knowing they'll be obsolete within 12 to 18 months, and you want to be able to replace them. We live in an era of constant change. And America's biggest problem, if you look at it through that lens, is that for too many people change is an enemy, not a friend. I mean, one reason you're all so happy is you found a way to make change your friend, right? Diversity is a strength, not a source of division, right? Change is a way to make money, not throw people out of work, right? If you decentralize and push decisions made down to the lowest possible level, you enable every employee to live up to the fullest of their ability. By giving them a 6-week break every 4 years, you don't force them to make these sharp divisions between your work life and your private life. It's sort of a seamless web. These are things we need to learn in America and we need to incorporate even into more traditional workplaces. So I'd like to start&mdash;we'll talk about the technology policy later, and the Vice President, who had done so much work, will talk a lot about the details at the end of this meeting. But I just want to start by telling you that one of our missions&mdash;in order to make this whole thing work we're going to have to make the Government work differently. Example: We cut the White House staff by 25 percent to set a standard for cutting inessential spending in the Government. But the work load of the White House is way up. We're getting all-time record telephone calls and letters coming in, and we have to serve our customers, too. Our customers are the people that put us there, and if they have to wait 3 months for an answer to a letter, that's not service.But when we took office, I walked into the Oval Office&mdash;it's supposed to be the nerve center of the United States&mdash;and we found Jimmy Carter's telephone system. All right. No speaker phone, no conference calls, but anybody in the office could punch the lighted button and listen to the President talk, so that I could have the conference call I didn't want but not the one I did. Then we went down into the basement where we found Lyndon Johnson's switchboard- &mdash;true story&mdash;where there were four operators working from early morning till late at night. Literally, when a phone would come and they'd say, I want to talk to the Vice President's office, they would pick up a little cord and push it into a little hole. That's today, right? We found procedures that were so bureaucratic and cumbersome for procurement that Einstein couldn't figure them out. And all the offices were organized in little closed boxes, just the opposite of what you see. In our campaign, however, we ran an organization in the Presidential campaign that was very much like this. Most decisions were made in a great big room in morning meetings that we had our senior staff in, but any 20-year-old volunteer who bad a good idea could walk right in and say, Here's my idea. Some of them were very good, and we incorporated them. And we had a man named Ellis Mottur who helped us to put together our technology policy. He was one of our senior citizens; he was in his fifties. And he said, I've been writing about high-performance work organizations all my life. And this is the first one I've ever worked in, and it has no organizational chart. I can't figure out what it looks like on paper, but it works. The Vice President was making fun of me when we were getting ready for the speech I gave Wednesday night to the Congress; it was like making sausage. People were running in and out saying, Put this in, and take this out. But it worked. You know, it worked. So I want to hear from you, but I want you to know that we have hired a person at the Office of Management and Budget who has done a lot of work in creating new businesses and turning businesses around, to run the management part of that. We're trying to review all these indictments that have been issued over the last several years about the way the Federal Government is rim. But I want you to know that I think a major part of my mission is to literally change the way the National Government works, spends your tax dollars, so that we can invest more and consume less and look toward the future. And that literally will require rethinking everything about the way the Government operates. The Government operates so much to keep bad things from happening that there's very little energy left in some places to make good things happen. If you spend all your time trying to make sure nothing bad happens, there's very little time and money and human energy left to make good things happen. We're going to try to pare away a lot of that bureaucracy and speed up the decision-making process and modernize it. And I know a lot of you can help. Technology is a part of that, but so is organization and empowerment, which is something you've taught us again today. And I thank you very much. We want to do a question and answer now, and then the Vice President is going to talk in more detail about our technology policy later. But that's what we and Ed agreed to do. He's my boss today; I'm doing what be &mdash; . So I wonder if any of you have a question you want to ask us or a comment you want to make. Yes, go ahead. Export Control Policy # Now that Silicon Graphics has entered the supercomputer arena, supercomputers are subject to very stringent and costly export controls. Is part of your agenda to review the export control system, and can industry count on export regulations that will keep pace with technology advances in our changing world? The Vice President. Let me start off on that. As you may know, the President appointed as the Deputy Secretary of Commerce John Rollwagen, who was the CEO at Cray. And he and Ron Brown, the Secretary of Commerce, have been reviewing a lot of procedures for stimulating U.S. exports around the world. And we're going to be a very export-oriented administration. However, we are also going to keep a close eye on the legitimate concerns that have in the past limited the free export of some technologies that can make a dramatic difference in the ability of a Qadhafi or a Saddam Hussein to develop nuclear weapons or ICBM's. Now, in some cases in the past, these legitimate concerns have been interpreted and implemented in a way that has frustrated American business unnecessarily. There are, for example, some software packages that are available off the shelf in stores here that are nevertheless prohibited from being exported. And sometimes that's a little bit unrealistic. On the other hand, there are some in business who are understandably so anxious to find new customers that they will not necessarily pay as much attention as they should to what the customer might use this new capacity for. And that's a legitimate role for Government, to say, hold on, the world will be a much more dangerous place if we have 15 or 20 nuclear powers instead of 5 or 6, and if they have ICBM's and so forth. So it's a balance that has to be struck very carefully. And we're going to have a tough nonproliferation strategy while we promote more exports. If I might just add to that, the short answer to your question, of course, is yes, we're going to review this. And let me give you one example: Ken told me last night at dinner, he said, If we export substantially the same product to the same person, if we have to get one permit to do it, we'll have to get a permit every time we want to do the same thing, over and over again. They always give it to us, but we have to wait 6 months, and it puts us behind the competitive arc. Now, that's something that ought to be changed, and we'll try to change that. We also know that some of our export controls, rules and regulations, are a function of the realities of the cold war which aren't there anymore. But what the Vice President was trying to say, and he said so well&mdash;I just want to reemphasize&mdash;our biggest security problem in the future may well be the proliferation of nuclear and nonnuclear, like biological and chemical, weapons of mass destruction to small, by our standards, countries with militant governments who may not care what the damage to their own people could be. So that's something we have to watch very closely. But apart from that, we want to move this much more quickly, and we'll try to slash a lot of the time delays where we ought to be doing these things. Scientific Visualization # Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, you've seen scientific visualization in practice here. As a company we're also very interested in ongoing research in high-performance computing and scientific visualization. Can we expect to see a change in the national scientific agenda that includes scientific visualization? Right now I don't see the scientific visualization as being represented, for example, on the FCCSET committee. The Vice President. It is a good question. One of the people who flew out here with us for this event and for the release of the technology policy in just a few minutes is Dr. Jack Gibbons, who is in the back of the room, the President's science adviser and head of the Office of Science and Technology Policy. And he will be in charge of the FCCSET process. That's an acronym that&mdash;what does it stand for, Jack&mdash;the Federal Coordinating Council on Science and Engin&mdash;what is it? Jack Gibbons. Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering, and Technology. The Vice President. Right. And visualization will play a key role in the deliberations of the FCCSET. We were actually, believe it or not, talking about this a little bit with Dr. Gibbons on the way over here. I had hearings one time where a scientist used sort of technical terms that he then explained. It made an impression on me. He said, If you tried to describe the human mind in terms applicable to a computer, you'd say we have a low bit rate but high resolution. Meaning&mdash;this is one of the few audiences I can use that line with. But he went on to explain what that means. When we try to absorb information bit by bit, we don't have a huge capacity to do it. That's why the telephone company, after extensive studies, decided that seven numbers were the most that we could keep in short-term memory. And then they added three more. But if we can see lots of information portrayed visually in a pattern or mosaic, where each bit of data relates to all of the others, we can instantly absorb a lot of information. We can all recognize the Milky Way, for example, even though there are trillions of points of light, stars, and so forth. And so the idea of incorporating visualization as a key component of this strategy is one that we recognize as very important, and we're going to pursue it. Let me just add one thing to that. First of all, I told the crowd last night that the Vice President was the only person ever to hold national office in America who knew what the gestalt of the gigabit is. But anyway&mdash;and now we're going to get some very funny articles out of this. They're going to make time of us for being policy wonks. Let me say something to sort of take this one step further. This whole visualization movement that you have been a part of in your line of work is going to merge in a very short time with the whole business in traditional education theory called applied academics. We're now finding, with just sort of basic computer work in the elementary schools of our country, dramatic differences in learning curves among people who can see the work they're doing as opposed to people who are supposed to read it. And we're now finding that the IQ's of young people who might take a vocational track in school may not be all that different from kids that would stay in a traditional academic track and wind up at Stanford, but their learning patterns are dramatically different. And there are some people&mdash;this is a huge new discovery, basically, that's coming into the whole business of traditional educational theory. So someday what you're doing here will revolutionize the basic teaching in our schools, starting at kindergarten and going forward, so that the world of work and the world of education will begin to be merged backwards all the way to the beginning. And it's going to be, I think, the most important thing we've ever done and very important for proving that in a diverse population all people can reach very high levels of achievement. Ed McCracken. The President and Vice President have also come here today to present a new national technology policy for the country. Do you want to&mdash; We'll answer some more questions. I'm going to forego my time and just let him announce the policy, so we can hear some more questions. Got to give the man equal time, I know. Economic Program # I'd just like to say, I didn't vote for you; I wish I had. I hope you feel that way 4 years from now. # Well, that's actually why I'm standing up. I really see a possibility in what you stand for, and I really think this is why you were elected, that you say you stand for change. You said that during your campaign. I think the company believed that. They're counting on you&mdash;I'm nervous&mdash;and I just want to say we're really, as a country, behind you. I think that's why the statistics are saying that we're willing to have our taxes increased; we're willing to have cuts, because you say you're really going to do it this time and decrease the deficit. I hope to God that you do. We need it not just for this present time, but by your actually fulfilling on this it will make a major change in how we feel about Government; that when Government says they're going to make a difference and they really come through, it will make a huge impact for the future. And I'm really personally behind you all the way. I wish I'd voted for you. Thank you. I really appreciate that. Let me make one comment in response, if I might. I think it's important, and you can help others understand this, to understand why we have to reduce the deficit, which is something that is normally not done when unemployment is high. And unemployment is still too high. Even though we're in an economic recovery, most of our recovery is due to higher productivity from firms that, in turn, this time are not hiring new people for all kinds of reasons. And we have to reduce the deficit for two reasons: Number one, we're already spending 15 percent of your tax money just to pay interest on past debt. If we don't change present patterns, we'll be over 20 cents by the year 2000. That's money we should be spending on education and technology in the future. Number two, the more money we take out of the pool of funds for borrowing, the more expensive it is for companies like this and other companies that have to go into the markets and borrow to borrow. Just since the election, since we made it clear we were going to try to bring the deficit down, long-term interest rates have dropped seven-tenths of one percent. That is a huge savings for everybody that is going to borrow money or that has a variable interest rate on a loan, whether it's a home mortgage or a business loan or a car loan or whatever. That's important. The second thing we're trying to do that I know you will also appreciate is to shift the balance of the money we do spend more away from consumption toward investment, investments in education, technology, environmental cleanup, and converting from a defense to a domestic economy. One of the bizarre things that happened to us in the eighties is that we increased the deficit first through defense expenses and then through exploding health care costs and increasing interest payments. But we reduced our investments in the future and the things that make us richer. So those are the changes we're trying to effect. Let me just make one other point. I will not support raising anybody's taxes unless budget cuts also pass. Foreign Trade # One of the things that Silicon Graphics has been really successful in is selling into the international markets. Approximately 50 percent of our revenues come internationally, including a substantial market in Japan. What types of programs does your administration plan to help the high-growth companies of the nineties sell to the international markets? Two things. First of all, we intend to try to open new markets and new markets in our region. That is, to keep America growing, I believe high-growth companies are going to have to sell south of the border more. And to do that we have to negotiate trade agreements that will help to raise incomes in those countries even as we are growing. That's why I support, with some extra agreements, the NAFTA agreement and why I hope we can have an agreement with Chile and hope we can have an agreement with other countries like Argentina that are making a serious effort to build market economies: because we want to build new markets for all of you. With Japan, I think what we have to do is to try to continue to help more companies figure out how to do business there and keep pushing them to open their markets. I don't want to close American markets to Japanese products, but it is the only nation with which we have a persistent and unchanging structural deficit. The product deficit with Japan is not $43 billion, which is our overall trade deficit, it is actually about $60 billion in product, in manufactured production. So we've got a lot of problems we have to work out there. With Europe, we sometimes are in surplus; we're sometimes in deficit. But it's a floating thing, so it's more or less in balance. With developing nations like Taiwan and Korea, those countries had big surpluses with us, but as they became richer they brought them down, so that we're more or less in balance. We have our biggest trade relationship with Canada, and we're more or less in balance. So we have to work on this Japanese issue while trying to help more of you get involved. Let me make one final comment on that. I think we should devote more Government resources to helping small and medium-size companies figure out how to trade, because that's what the Germans do with such great success and why they're one of the great exporters of the world. They don't waste a lot of money on the real big companies that have already figured it out, but they have extra efforts for small and medium-size companies to get them to think global from the beginning of their endeavors. And I think we're going to have to do more of that. The Environment # In addition to concerns about the economy, Silicon Graphics employees are also concerned about the environment. Your economic plan does a great job of promoting R&D investment. Are there any elements that are specifically targeted to promote the application of Silicon Graphics technology to environmental-friendly initiatives such as the electric car or the mag-lev train? I think I should let the Vice President answer that since it's his consuming passion. And if I do it, his book sales will go up again. We devoted a lot of time and attention to that for two reasons. One is the environment needs it. Secondly, we think it's wonderful economics, because I believe that all these environmental opportunities that are out there for us represent a major chunk of what people who used to be involved in defense technologies could be doing in the future if we're going to maintain a high wage base in America. So I'd like for the Vice President to talk a little about the specifics that we're working on. The Vice President. That goal is integrated into the technology plan as one of our key objectives. The Japanese and the Germans are now openly saying that the biggest new market in the history of world business is the market for the new products, technologies, and processes that foster economic progress without environmental destruction. Some have compared the drive for environmental efficiency to the movement for quality control and the quality revolution in the sixties and seventies. At that time, you know, many companies in the United States felt that the existing level of product quality was more or less ordained by the forces of supply and demand and it couldn't be improved without taking it out of the bottom line. But the Japanese, taking us innovations from Dr. Deming and others, began to introduce a new theory of product quality and simultaneously improved quality, profits, wages, and productivity. The environmental challenge now presents us with the same opportunity. By introducing new attention to environmental efficiency at every step along the way, we can simultaneously reduce the impact of all our processes on the environment, improve environmental efficiency, and improve productivity at the same time. We need to set clear, specific goals in the technology policy, in the economic plan. And you know, both the stimulus package and the investment package focus a great deal on environmental cleanup and environmental innovation. And whereas we've talked a lot about roads and bridges in the past, and they're a big part of this plan also, we're putting relatively more emphasis as well on water lines and sewer lines and water treatment plants and renovating the facilities in the national parks and cleaning up trails, taking kids from inner cities and putting them to work cleaning up trails in national parks, for example, as part of the summer jobs program. So you'll find when you look at both the technology plan and the economic plan an enormous emphasis on the environment. Go ahead, sir. They say we have to quit in a minute. I'll take one more question after this. The Economy # Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, the news stories and articles that the public has access to regarding the budget and the economy are very often confusing and contradictory. I might explain it in the same terms that you used: The information is delivered low bit rate, but the problem is huge and requires the highres view. So my question is: I wonder if you're using Lyndon Johnson's computer to analyze the budget and the economy, or whether or not you might be open to using some of the things you've seen here to get the bigger picture and also communicate that to us? Thank you. There are two things I'd like to respond to on that, and I'd like to invite you to help. I'd like to invite you to help, and I'd like to invite you to help on two grounds: One is the simple ground of helping to decide which visual images best capture the reality of where we are and where we're going. Senator Moynihan and I went to Franklin Roosevelt's home in Hyde Park, New York, just a couple of days ago. You may have seen the press on it. And on the way back he said to me that the challenges that we face are different from those that Roosevelt faced but just as profound. Unemployment was higher and America was more devastated when he took office, he said, but everybody knew what the problem was. Therefore, he bad a lot of leeway working with the Congress in the beginning to work toward a solution. Now, he said, we are facing severe challenges to a century of economic leadership, and it's not clear to every American exactly what the dimensions of the problem are. The capacity you have to help me help the American people conceptualize this is quite significant: showing the trends in the deficit, showing the trends in the investment, showing how the money is spent now and bow we propose to spend it. The second big problem we have you can see if you look at the front page of USA Today today, which shows a traditional analysis, yesterday's analysis&mdash;of the business section&mdash;of the economic program. It basically says, Oh, it will bring unemployment down a little and it will increase economic growth a little if we do this, but not all that much. Now, why is that? That's because traditional economic analysis says that the only way the Government can ever help the economy grow is by spending more money and taxing less. In other words, traditional Keynesian economies: Run a bigger deficit. But we can't do that. The deficit's already so big, I can't run the risk to the long-term stability of this country by going in and doing that. This analysis doesn't really make a distinction between investment and consumption, doesn't take any account of what we might do with a technology policy or a trade policy to make the economy grow faster, has no way of factoring in what other good things could happen in the private market if you brought long-term interest rates down through the deficit. So you could also help us to reconceptualize this. A lot of the models that dominate policy-making are yesterday's models, too. I'll give you just one example. The Japanese had a deficit about as big as ours, and they were increasing spending at 19 percent a year, government spending, back in the early seventies when the oil prices went way up and they were more energy-dependent than we were on foreign oil. And they just decided they had to change it, but they couldn't stop investing. So they had a budget which drew a big distinction, a literal distinction, legal distinction, between investment and consumption, and they embarked on a 10 or 11 year effort to bring the budget into balance. And during that time they increased investment and lowered unemployment and increased growth through the right kind of spending and investment. And I want to lead in, if I might, and ask the Vice President before we go to give you some of the specifics of this technology policy, by making one more pitch to you about this whole economic plan. This plan has 150 specific budget cuts. And I'm welcome to more. I told the Republican leadership if they had more budget cuts that didn't compromise our economy, if they helped us, I would be glad to embrace them. I'm not hung up about that. But I did pretty good in 4 weeks to find 150, and I'll try to find some more on my own. It also has the revenue increases that you know about. It also bas some spending increases, and there will be debate about that. There will be people who say, Well, just don't spend this new money. Don't immunize all the kids. Don't fully fund Head Start. Don't pay for this technology policy. Don't invest in all these environmental cleanup things, and that way you won't have to raise taxes so much. The problem is, if you look at the historic spending trends, we are too low on investment and too high on the deficit, and both are problems. And secondly, we've got to have some of these economic cooperations in order to move the economy forward. So I want you to listen to what the Vice President says in that context. Because what you will hear is, we don't need to do what we think we should do in this area. If we don't, I think we'll be out of competition. People like you will do fine because you've got a good company here, but the country as a whole will fall behind. And you can help on both those points.So would you proceed?",clinton
"Thank you very much, Chairman Shrontz, Speaker Foley, Senator Murray, Governor Lowrey, and Member of the congressional delegation, and most of all to the men and women of Boeing. I have looked forward to coming here for a long time. And I guess what I ought to begin by saying is, thank you for Air Force One. You know, everywhere I go in that airplane, I am the second most important celebrity. People really just want to see the plane. And I know I can make all my friends and supporters happy, even my mother, just by taking them on the plane and letting them look at your magnificent work. You should also know that it enables me on these flights across the country and going across the world to continue to work with a full staff almost as if I had never left the office. And it is a real tribute to all of you, and a magnificent set of planes&mdash;you know, there are two of them. I know a lot of you made them both, so you know that. But I'm grateful to you for that. I also think you may know, but I should say that after this meeting with you, I'm going to go to another room and meet with a lot of folks who have come here to meet with me and with our national leaders about the health of the airline industry, about the commercial airline companies themselves, and about the airline manufacturers, the chief of which obviously is Boeing, but including other companies as well. So when I leave you, I'm going to go and meet with them for about an hour to talk about where we're going from here. I want to begin by saying that there's an interesting book, which has been written by a very famous economics writer named Lester Thurow called Head to Head. And Thurow's argument in this book is&mdash;it affects your lives, so I'm going to tell you about it&mdash;his argument is that there may be a limited number of highway jobs available over the next 20 years, and that seven major technologies will provide most of the growth in those jobs, a lot of them are, as you might suspect, in the computer and electronics field. I was just down in Silicon Valley before I came here at a magnificent little company named Silicon Graphics that does some work for you, to talk about a technology policy to accelerate the growth in areas where we're doing well. But one of those seven areas is aeronautics and the manufacturer of airplanes and in the provision of airline services to commercial travelers. It is indeed ironic that the United States which, for so long has led the world in the production of airplanes and in the development of sophisticated consumer-oriented services through commercial carriers, has had 3 years in which more money has been lost than was made in the previous history of the airline industry. And I can tell you from my study, very little of that is your fault. A lot of it has to do with the fact that other nations follow targeted strategies of partnerships to pierce markets which you had dominated under a free market system but with which you could not compete in Europe's subsidized airbus to the tune of $26 billion, for example. I want to talk to you today about the whole economic plan, the tough parts as well as the good parts. But I want you to know that one big part of my economic strategy is to try to identify all those areas that can really provide high-wage, high-growth futures for Americans and their families and make sure that we are there, competing and winning, that people have a chance to work and make a living. And we can't begin by giving up on the production of aircraft, which is what we have come dangerously close to doing by sitting by and letting our competitors do things that we did not do to meet the competition. And I believe we can do better. I hope this meeting today is the first step in that regard. I also want to say a special word of appreciation to the Speaker and to the leaders of Congress. In the next few days, the Congress will produce a bill establishing a national commission on the condition of the airlines industries in America; one that will require the House and the Senate to appoint five members each and the President to appoint five members; and unlike a lot of commissions, will require them to report back within 90 days with a tight time table with a specific set of recommendations to take to the country to preserve and promote the economic health of the industry that you've done so much to make the world's best. The second thing I want to say is that my trade ambassador, Mickey Kantor, will be closely monitoring the agreement which was made finally last year with regard to limiting European subsidies to airbus to allow a level playing field. We'll be seeking tough new discipline on those subsidies, both in our attempts to get an agreement on the general agreement on trade, as well as the specific aircraft code. You know, I've seen these agreements made for years. I've seen people promise us they'd do this, that, and the other thing, and then nothing ever happens. And I think you and I know deep in our heart that most of these layoffs&mdash;maybe not all, because the airline industry itself has problems which are bleeding back on to you, the commercial carriers&mdash;but a lot of these layoffs would not have been announced had it not been for the $26 billion that the United States sat by and let Europe plow into airbus over the last several years. So we're going to try to change the rules of the game. I can't promise you overnight miracles. We didn't get into this fix overnight. But I can say that we have to turn the direction of this country around, and we need a commitment, not to shield ourselves from competition but to reward ourselves when we fairly compete and win. We need a commitment to meet the competition around the world in a global economy in which the things that really pay off are high levels of education and skills, high levels of investment in appropriate technologies, a very close amount of cooperation within each workplace among workers and between workers and management, and in the national sense bet-ween Government and business and labor. The countries which do that win; those which don't are punished. And we can no longer afford to wait for 10 years while someone does something to us that we do not respond to. And I want to turn that around, not with overnight miracles but with a disciplined approach to put the American people and their economic future first in the policy-making of the United States Government. It's your country, and I'm doing my best to give it back to you. I ask each of you to express to your Congressmen and your Senators support for the national economic plan which I announced to the Congress on last Wednesday. It is a plan which seeks to do two things that we've never done in the history of America before at the same time. It seeks to reduce this awful Government debt and to increase investment in our future at the same time. And it's hard to cut your debts and increase your investment at the same time. It's hard if you're Boeing. It's hard if you're the United States Government.But we have no choice, because in the last 12 years, we have quadrupled the debt of the Government, which means we're spending 15 cents of every dollar you give us in taxes right now just paying interest on yesterday's debt, 15 cents of every dollar you pay in taxes that we can't put into an investment incentive for an airline company, for an education for your children, for better health care for America. It also means we're taking so much money out of the pool of money available that if Boeing or a small business or somebody wanting to buy a car or a home has to borrow money, their interest rates are higher than they otherwise would be. So we've got to bring the debt down, but we also have to look over the last 12 years. Your country has reduced its investment while our competitors have increased their investments in critical areas of education and training and new technologies and in building the kinds of things that put people to work and make a country rich. So to do it, we have to cut spending, raise some more tax money, and target some new investments, not in consuming things but in things that will build jobs and incomes in the years ahead. I have offered the Congress in good faith an honest spending cut program with 150 specific reductions in spending cuts, including a 25 percent cut in my own staff, the biggest, as far as I can tell, in the history of the Republic, certainly in the 20th century, and a $9 billion cut in the administrative costs to the Federal Government, and asking the Federal employees who work for you to have a pay freeze this year and to have their pay go up at less than the rate of inflation for the next 3 years, which will save that much again. We are cutting spending where we can. I have also made it clear that I don't want to raise one penny of tax dollars until I know those cuts are in effect. We shouldn't raise money until we cut spending. We should do them together. Seventy percent of the burden of this tax program will fall on people whose taxable income, not net income, taxable income is above $100,000. But some of it will fall on people with incomes of between $30,000 and $100,000, and I want to level with you about that. For years there have been those who say we ought to reduce the deficit by raising the gas tax a whole lot. That's fine if you live in the city and ride mass transit to work. It's not so good if you live in the country and drive yourself to work. There are a lot of working people in America today that have no access to mass transit and can't carpool; so I rejected a big gas tax. Then there were people who said, Well, the best thing to do environmentally is to tax carbon. That's a funny way of saying coal. The problem with that is, there's a lot of people just like you in Pennsylvania and West Virginia and places like that who make their livings in and around the coal mines. And it didn't seem fair to me to put such a burden on them that they would be in trouble. So we decided to pick what seems to be the environmentally best thing that doesn't hurt so many people, and that is a tax on the energy capacity of all forms of fuel, of gas and oil and coal, called a BTU tax, which amounts to about 2 cents on a gallon of gasoline, and will cost the average family with an income of $50,000 about 15 bucks a month at the outside if they have a family of four and drive a lot. And I think that is a fair way to go. I didn't want to even do that, but after the election I was told that the Government deficit was going to be about $50 billion a year bigger than we had been told before the election. And so my choice was not to ask for an additional contribution from the middle class, let the deficit get out of hand, and have your interest rates go up, or try to deal with this debt and try to face the fact that we need to invest some more money too. I hope you'll support that. But I also hope you will support spending some more money in the areas that will create jobs. And let me just mention two or three. This plan contains tax incentives to business and direct investments in things like roads and environmental cleanup and airport construction that will create a half a million jobs in the next year and a ball. This plan contains $8 billion in new investments in aeronautics, in technology, in research and development, the development of new products over the next 5 years. It contains a major new general technology initiative that the Vice President and I announced today in Silicon Valley to create high-wage jobs. It contains $9 billion in new investments in high-tech products all across the Government, including the attempt to develop an environmentally clean ear and new high speed rail technology that could dramatically alter the economies of living on the Pacific Rim of our country. It contains new incentives to businesses to create jobs and especially to small business. Let me tell you that all the big companies in the country together reduced jobs all during the 1980's, but little companies created more jobs than big companies lost until about 2 years ago when the cost of health care, the unavailability of credit, and the decline of the economy stopped small business in its tracks. So we have to not only help big manufacturing operations; we've got to have a climate where people can start small businesses and keep them going. Because we know that even if we do very well in the aerospace industry, for example, there will be other very big companies that will have to downsize and restructure. And we've got to do something for small business to try to help them to go and to grow. These things are very important. And let me say one other thing that affects Boeing, at least a little bit, and that is we propose to put a lot more money into the space program, but to restructure it so that we not only have a space station but we also have a lot of new investments in other kinds of aeronautics research that will generate even more jobs in America in the years ahead. And we've proposed to spend more money on domestic research and development than we reduce in defense research and development. These are the things that made your company great, and these are the kinds of things that will make America great again. And so I ask you to support not just the spending cuts, the revenue increases, and the deficit reduction but also these very targeted investments in our future. I also ask you to support immunizing every child before the age of 2 in America, for a change, Head Start for the kids that need it, and making college loans available to all middle class, as well as low-income people, and letting them pay those loans off as a percentage of their income. Now, a lot of people will say&mdash;there's a lot of ways you can debate this&mdash;a lot of people will say, I didn't cut spending enough. To them, I say give me more spending cuts. I've just been there 4 weeks, and I'm sure there are more, and I'll find more. Then there will be those that say we cut too much. Some will say we didn't raise enough money. Some will say we've raised too much. And then some will say you shouldn't spend any new money. But remember what I said: A country now is like a big company in the global economy. If you don't invest in the right things, you don't grow. So we not only have to reduce this deficit; we've got to turn our spending priorities on their head. We've got to invest more and consume less so the country can grow, just like you want this company to grow. I believe with all my heart that the years ahead can still be the best years this country ever had. But you know what you're going through now. Just look at it. We are living in a world where change is the law of life, where the average 18-year-old will change work eight times in a lifetime. And we will be judged harshly by our children if we permit the kinds of things to go on that are happening today, which make change our enemy and not our friend. My whole goal in this economic program is to try to change the priorities of this country so people can pursue what the Founding Fathers wanted, life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, by making change our friend. I can't promise you and no politician can, to repeal the laws of global competition. I can't promise you that you won't have to work not only harder but smarter than ever before. Nobody can do that. But I think you know that your Government has been inadequate to the task of preparing you to win if you play by the rules, if you do your part, if you're highly productive. That's my job. That's what this plan's designed to do. I hope you will support it. I think it will secure the American dream for you and your children. Thank you very much, and God bless you all.[At this point, the President was presented with a gift.] Thank you. I want to say two things. First of all, it was very diplomatic of you not to give me a bigger shirt than you gave Vice President Gore. And secondly, I don't think anyone who sees me running in this will really believe I'm about to fly. But I will wear it and enjoy it every day.Thank you very much.",clinton
"I would like to thank Frank Shrontz and the good people at Boeing for hosting representatives of the major airline companies in the United States, as well as manufacturers of airplanes and airplane engines, along with the Secretary of Transportation, the Speaker of the House, and the distinguished Members of the Washington congressional delegation along with the Governor of this State. We have had a very good meeting about the problems of the manufacturers of airlines and the airline companies themselves, airplanes and airline companies. We talked a lot about the proposal now in the Congress, which is soon to be passed, to create a national commission to ensure a strong, competitive airline industry. That commission will require five appointments from the House, five appointments from the Senate, and five appointments from the President. I assured the representatives here, as did the Speaker, that we had no desire other than to find the 15 best people in America immediately to work on this issue, without regard to party or region. We just want to work together to appoint people who will come back within 90 days and give us some concrete suggestions to revitalize this very important part of our economic future. I thought it was a terrific meeting. We went around the table. Everyone who was at the meeting made a very constructive set of comments about what they thought we ought to do. And I look forward to the legislation passing, to signing it, and to immediately making the appointments and to going to work. # What do you think, Mr. President, that will mean for the worker who is laid off here? What will be the direct&mdash; Well, if we do a good job, we'll be able to find more business and bring some of them back to work. That's what we want to do. I'd like to ask the Speaker and the Secretary and Mr. Shrontz and anybody else who is here who wants to make a comment to make some comments, and then we'll answer a couple of more questions.[At this point, Speaker of the House of Representatives Thomas S. Foley, Secretary of Transportation Federico Pena, and Frank Shrontz, president and CEO, Boeing Co., made brief remarks.] # Mr. President&mdash;[inaudible].&mdash; If you guys would talk, I wouldn't have to answer so many questions. Bosnia # Mr. President, are we going to airdrop supplies in to the besieged people in Bosnia? It's a possibility. I want to wait a couple of more days before I announce a policy on it. Economic Program # Mr. President, you said in your speech that you wanted spending cuts first and then invest in programs you call investments. Given that your spokes-people had said you're going to pass an authorization for short-term stimulus spending and that the rest of the package has come down the line, and given that most of the spending comes in the early years and the taxes would come in the out-years, in what sense do you want the spending cuts first? Well, I want an omnibus program passed which has all the spending cuts mandated along with the tax increases. I don't want to raise taxes and then sit around waiting to see whether the spending cuts are going to be enacted. I think that we ought to pass a package which includes the spending cuts at the same time we raise revenues. # Will you still be&mdash;to do your new spending first? European Airline Subsidies # [Inaudible]&mdash;the airbus? Well, you may know that last year our Government signed an agreement, which had the support of the airline industry, which got a commitment out of Europe to dramatically reduce the subsidies to airbus. What I seek to do, number one, is to review it as to its adequacy and, number two, to make sure it's enforced. But I think we made a huge mistake permitting it to happen with no response. And I hope that it's not too late to have an appropriate response to maintain our position in this global marketplace. U.S. Trade Policy # Do you think you need a tougher trade policy, in general, Mr. President? No, not necessarily. I think we need a different trade policy. Let me say that the linchpin of our policy still must be to expand trade. A wealthy country cannot grow wealthier by hunkering down within its own borders. We have to be a great trading nation, and we have to help other nations to grow wealthier in order for them to buy more of our products. So our goal still has to be to expand trade. But we no longer have the luxury, with other nations having grown so much more rapidly than we for 20 years, other nations being about as wealthy as we are&mdash;we no longer have the luxury of being the only country in the world that can ignore certain problems in terms of trade fairness that other countries don't ignore. We have to make sure that we are treated in these market-opening measures with the requisite amount of fairness. And so I think we may have a timber trade policy in some respects than we've had in the past, but our allies will be under no illusions. I do not want a protectionist trade policy; I want to expand trade. But I want to do it in ways that preserves America as a high-wage country. Otherwise, we won't be very good trading partners for a lot of these nations over the long run.Thank you very much.",clinton
"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I want to formally welcome Prime Minister Major to the White House and to the United States. We are delighted to have him here. As I'm sure you know, he has already met earlier today with people on the Hill and with members of my Cabinet. We have just finished the first of two meetings. We talked for about an hour, and then this evening we'll have a working dinner. About the conversations we've had so far, I'd just like to make two points. First, we covered a wide range of topics. We talked about Bosnia, as you might imagine we would. We talked about the Middle East. And then the rest of our time was spent virtually exclusively talking about economic matters, about the upcoming meeting of the G-7; about the importance of trying to get an agreement under GATT and my commitment to that; about the absolute necessity of the United States, Europe, and Japan working together during this difficult time to try to prevent a contraction of the global economy and instead to hopefully promote growth, not only here at home but throughout the world. And we talked about that at some considerable detail. The Prime Minister, as you know, has been in office a lot longer than I have. And I asked him for his advice about a number of things and his opinion about others. And we had a very, very good meeting. And I'm looking forward to our dinner tonight. A second point I would like to make is to reaffirm something that some of you asked me during the photo op, and that is whether the United States will continue to have a very special relationship with Great Britain. The answer to that from my point of view is an unqualified yes. I think that only two Presidents ever lived in England. I think I'm one of only two. There may have been more somewhere in the past centuries. But this is a very important relationship to me, and I think it's off to a very good start. And I would like to say again how much I appreciate the candor with which the Prime Minister has approached the issues, with which we've discussed our mutual interests. Mr. Prime Minister. Prime Minister Major. Mr. President, firstly, thank you for your welcome today. And I've found our meeting extremely useful, and I look forward to continuing it this evening. And I certainly had some very useful meetings this morning on the Hill and with other members of your Cabinet earlier this morning, with Lloyd Bentsen, and of course over lunch as well with some of your colleagues. It's nice, having bad a number of telephone conversations over the last few months, to actually see a face across the table rather than just hear a voice across the phone. And I look forward to continuing that dialog this evening. You set out some of the things that we were able to discuss over the last hour or so. I was particularly pleased we were able to reach such a meeting of minds on the importance of reaching an agreement to the Uruguay round as speedily as possible. I think we share the view that for a raft of reasons it's important to get a satisfactory and fair agreement to the GATT round, not just because of the impetus that will give to trade growth and hopefully to prosperity and job growth as well but also because of the very remarkable advantage that will give not just to the industrialized but to the nonindustrialized world with the many difficulties that are faced economically at the moment. So I was particularly pleased at our meeting of minds on that particular subject. We found also a complete agreement about the need for the Security Council resolutions that have been imposed in respect to Iraq to be fully met and to be fully honored in the future. I had the pleasure of being able to welcome the President's initiative, humanitarian airdrops in Bosnia. The United Kingdom&mdash;we've got a number of thousands of troops actually delivering humanitarian aid in central Bosnia. They've been doing that for some time. I think as a result of their activities, many people who otherwise might not have lived through ibis winter have done. And I think this new initiative by the President is thoroughly welcome. So it's been a very worthwhile and a very enjoyable meeting thus far, and I look forward to continuing it this evening.Thank you. Northern Ireland # Mr. President, do you still want a U.S. envoy&mdash;[inaudible]&mdash;Northern Ireland&mdash; Well, let me answer the first question. If the United States can in some way make a constructive contribution to a political settlement, of course, we'd be interested in doing that. But that is not a subject we have discussed in any way so far. And I think I'd rather wait to make further comments until after we have a chance to discuss it. As far as the campaign, the campaign is over. You're a good one to ask that question, since you know that compared to previous campaigns I've been in, this was just sort of another day at the office. And once you achieve the responsibilities of office, that's what you have to do. I told the Prime Minister today that I was just grateful that I got through this whole campaign with most of my time in England still classified. Bosnia # [Inaudible]&mdash;on Bosnia. I'd like to ask both you and the Prime Minister, what do you think can be accomplished in the airdrops, since many in the military believe that it will not be terribly effective or efficient? And what other steps do you think need to be taken, military steps, in particular, such as some that were discussed during the campaign, in order to inflict enough pressure on the Serbs? Let me deal with the airdrops first. General Powell came over here last weekend, and we talked for a very extended period of time about this operation and about how we can maximize the safety to United States pilots and other personnel on the planes who'd be involved in this and minimize the prospect that any humanitarian relief operation could be drawn into the politics and the military operations of this area. We know that if we are high enough to virtually assure the complete safety of the people who will participate in the airlift, that a percentage of the packages we drop will be outside the more or less half-mile circle that we would be trying to hit. We also know that if we leaflet the area in advance, if we notify the people about what we're dropping and how to use the medicine and what kind of food will be there, to whatever extent people need it, they'll be on the lookout for it. And if they have to walk a mile instead of a half-mile for it, we think they will. So we believe that, A, there is a need in some of the remote areas, and B, we can do this with quite an effective but safe mission. Now, insofar as other actions, I think there are a number of things that we're looking at. I'm encouraged by the United Nations interest in the war crimes issue. I'm encouraged by the conversation the Prime Minister and I had about the importance of trying to make the sanctions that are now in force actively be more effective. But I would remind you that our policy is that we want to try to have a good faith in negotiations with all the parties there. We are committed to doing what we can to encourage the Bosnians to engage in negotiations within the Vance-Owen framework. And President Yeltsin has been very forthcoming on his part in trying to help get the negotiations back on track, too. So, I think we should look at it just from that point of view. It would be a great mistake to read this humanitarian relief operation as some initial foray toward a wider military role. Prime Minister Major. Can I just add something to that, as you requested. We're able, at the moment, to deliver a substantial amount of aid in central Bosnia by land. But the natural terrain of Bosnia, as a whole, means that isn't practicable for a raft of reasons, not least geographical reasons, at the moment in all parts of Bosnia. I think, therefore, you do have to look at imaginative ways of actually getting food aid and medicine aid through. And I think the prospect that the President is exploring is an imaginative one, and I hope it will prove successful. There are a number of logistics to be worked out. On sanctions, one of the things we have been discussing in the last half an hour or so is the prospects of enhanced sanctions, and I think there clearly are opportunities there that we'll need to examine. # Such as? Prime Minister Major. Well, I think we can improve the sanctions over the Danube, for example. I don't think they're being enforced very effectively. Russia # I would like to direct my question to both of you. Do you think that Yeltsin, President Yeltsin, is so politically weakened that his days are numbered? Also, what can the U.S. and the allies do to prop him up, to prevent another Communist takeover that could lead to another cold war? And are you going to meet President Yeltsin in March at any point? Prime Minister Major. I don't think President Yeltsin is weakened by his present conflict to the extent that he's not going to continue. Clearly there are difficulties in the disputes he's had with Congress and, in particular, the Speaker. But I expect President Yeltsin to be there and to continue. I think he's the best hope for the Russians, and I think the policies and the movements towards reform that he has in mind and continues to have in mind are the right ways forward. I think there are two things we can do to help Russia in general and President Yeltsin. One is the economic assistance that's been provided, and there's a great deal of discussion to be had about whether we're directing that in the right way and in the right volume. And secondly, I think also there's the political messages of support to the reformers and to the reform policies, personified at the moment in the person of President Yeltsin. But the underlying purpose of the assistance is to assist the reformers and to assist the reform policies in Russia. I think we ought to give them political support as well as the practical and economic support that we've been giving them. I believe that President Yeltsin has not been paralyzed by what's happened. I support him and his role and what he's trying to do. I have not established a definite date for a meeting with him yet, but I do hope to meet with him soon personally. I know he's having some trouble with his Congress, but that's part of being in a democratic society with an elected President separate from the Congress. He may just be learning what it's like in our system. I don't want to minimize that, but I think it is a grave error to assume that he cannot continue and do well. I believe he can. And I think that in terms of what we ought to be doing about it, I think the Prime Minister has pretty well laid out the kind of political and economic support we ought to be giving. But let me say that as all of you know, I have placed a great priority on this. The State Department will now have an ambassador at large whose job it is to coordinate a response not only to Russia but to all the Republics of the former Soviet Union. And we have a very distinguished American, Thomas Pickering, nominated to be our Ambassador to Moscow. We are putting a lot of effort into trying to support democracy and trying to support economic recovery there. Multilateral Trade Negotiations # [Inaudible]&mdash;I don't have a word count, sir, but it's interesting that Prime Minister Major here may have said more about the importance of the Uruguay round than you have here in the White House. I wonder, do you take away from your meeting with him any renewed sense of the importance of that round, and if so, how you plan now to approach it? Well, we're going to ask for an extension of fast track authority. And we're going to really put a real effort into a successful conclusion of the round. I advocated that in 1991 at the beginning of my race for President, and I still feel very strongly that it's important. I think if you look at the press response around the world to the economic plan I've presented to Congress, it's been very positive because our trading partners have been asking us for years to make a real effort to reduce the debt. And so we're doing that. And I think that sparks hope not only here at home but around the world. And I think if we were to successfully conclude the Uruguay round, that would also spark hope that we will be expanding trade on terms that are fair to everyone. So I'm very hopeful that we can get a trade agreement. Northern Ireland # Did you raise today the question of human rights in Northern Ireland, and did you get to discuss it with him&mdash; We haven't discussed Northern Ireland at all. And after we do, I'll be happy to answer your questions. Bosnia # Mr. Prime Minister, you expressed earlier-said that you are not remotely concerned about the British troops, that they will be in any danger because&mdash;[inaudible]&mdash;defense against these deliveries, and the President has said&mdash;[inaudible]&mdash;slight risk. And I'm wondering, beyond your saying you have this policy, if both of you could give some idea of why you sound so confident there will be no attempts to stop this&mdash;[inaudible]. There's been a lot of effort to block it so far. Well, all I can tell you is General Powell has been&mdash;let me answer, and then he'll answer&mdash;has been asked to design the mission in such a way that we would minimize risk to our folks. And we have obviously engaged in an extensive consultation, which is not over. Helen's [Helen Thomas, United Press International] been asking me every day when I was ready to make this announcement. The consultations aren't over. And one of the things that we want, we want everybody to know that this is a humanitarian mission, that we're prepared to help anybody who needs the food and medicine. And we want the broadest possible support for this. And we want all the people on the ground in the various factions to know that this is not a political issue with us. We're very encouraged by the responses we've gotten so far to all the elements with whom we have discussed this plan. That's all I can tell you. # Mr. Prime Minister, could you answer, please? Prime Minister Major. I don't think there's a great deal to add to it. As I indicated earlier, there's a twin-track approach. We're providing aid by land. The President has in mind aid delivered by air to areas where we can't reach it by land. I've no reason to suppose that that is going to put at risk the lives of the British soldiers in central Bosnia. # But you're in an area where they have a fighter capability and an antiaircraft weapon. If they don't want this material to be delivered, they have to use that. Prime Minister Major. Well, you asked the question. I've given you the judgment I make. Middle East Peace Talks # Mr. President, you said you discussed the Middle East. Did you reach any conclusion, and do you favor returning to the peace talks even if the Palestinians do not? We talked mostly about the importance of adhering to the United Nations resolutions as they apply to Iraq and the aftermath of the Gulf war and about our general support for the peace process continuing. We didn't deal with that issue, and I think I ought to wait until the Secretary of State returns from his mission before I discuss it further. Bosnia # You talk about consultations on Bosnia. Is there any realistic expectations at this point that any other country except for the United States will be involved in this airdrop? Yes, we might have some other countries involved in it. I don't think it would be&mdash;I believe the Prime Minister made his statement. I think he's done his part. His troops are on the ground there. But I think there is a chance that we will have support from other nations. # [Inaudible]&mdash;ask Great Britain to participate in the airdrop as well?No. # [Inaudible]&mdash;question to both leaders. Do you think that the current Vance-Owen map forms the fair basis for a settlement of the crisis in the former Yugoslavia? Prime Minister Major. Well, that the matter that has to be negotiated between the parties. And I don't think I'm going to express a view on whether that is the right map. I think the process of seeking a negotiated settlement and trying to reach by agreement between the three parties, an agreement on the map that will enable a political settlement to be reached is the right way. But I don't think it's for me to judge whether the map is right. Clearly, the views of the participants at the moment is that the map isn't right. But that is the purpose of negotiations. That is why I was delighted to hear this morning that Karadzic and Izethegovic will be joining talks again with Boban so that they can actually talk to Cy Vance and David Owen and see if they can reach an agreement. The first prize is clearly an agreement that is reached voluntarily and willingly and as speedily as possible. The only thing I would say, just to add to that, is that I agree with what the Prime Minister has said. As you know, the United States feels very strongly that this agreement must be just that, an agreement that must not be shoved down the throat of the Bosnians or anyone else if it's going to work. We also feel strongly that all the parties should negotiate in good faith. And therefore, I agree with what he said about the map. I would make this further point: The United States has made it clear in our statement of policy that if an agreement is reached in good faith, that we would be prepared to be part of a NATO or United Nations effort to monitor or support the agreement, and that map would be difficult to monitor and support, I think. But I think we're going to have to&mdash;before we make any final judgments, we need to give the parties a chance to reach their accord. Spending Cuts # Mr. President, on&mdash;[inaudible]&mdash;economics, you indicated you will find more spending cuts. Will you give a sense of when? And are you really talking about a new round of cuts or just&mdash; Oh well, what I said was, I have invited the Members of the Congress to present them to me and instructed our people to continue to look for them. And I presume as we define things that we're willing to put on the table, we will continue to do it. We don't have any orchestrated theory about how to do that now. But I'd be surprised if there aren't some more coming. Airbus # Mr. Prime Minister, were you disappointed or taken aback by what the President said the other day about the airbus, and were you reassured by your conversations today? Prime Minister Major. There's an agreement over the degree of subsidies for projects like airbus. And that agreement continues into July, and I think there is no proposition in what the President said to change that particular agreement. Northern Ireland # Mr. President, you said you may discuss Northern Ireland this evening. Would you expect to discuss both the&mdash;[inaudible]&mdash;issue and the human rights issue? And do you share the view expressed by some Members of Congress, Senators and Representatives, that there are abuses to human rights in Northern Ireland that need to be addressed? And perhaps the Prime Minister would like to address that allegation. Prime Minister Major. Well, I'll address that point first. The real abuse of human rights in Northern Ireland is the abuse of human rights of people who find bombs in shopping malls when they're going about their ordinary, everyday business. I think that is the abuse of human rights that is overwhelmingly the concern of everybody in Northern Ireland on both sides of the sectarian divide. Over the past 2 or 3 years, the British Government with the Taoiseach and with the political parties in Northern Ireland, have been engaged on talks to try and find a political settlement to a problem that has existed in Northern Ireland for generations. We are seeking that agreement. Those talks, I believe it is fair to say, have made more progress than most people believed was possible. Talks came to a halt with the general election in the Republic of Ireland and the forthcoming local elections in Northern Ireland. But it is the policy of my government to resume those talks, to resume those talks with all the parties in Northern Ireland and try and reach a satisfactory political settlement and remove many of the disputes and hatreds that have existed for generations. Those disputes and hatreds are worsened by violence, whether it is the IRA violence or whether it is the response to IRA violence which has also been prevalent over the last year or so. I condemn both unreservedly and without any distinction. # Mr. President&mdash;[inaudible]&mdash;respond to that. I believe that obviously there has to be a political solution there, or there will be no solution at all, and that the human fights issues will have to be addressed in that context. Whether the United States can play any sort of constructive role is something that we want to discuss later this evening.Press Secretary Myers. Last question. Economic Program # Mr. President, here just one week after your speech announcing your budget and economic plan, Senator Bob Dole is pronouncing it in trouble. What's your read on that, and do you think this is the start of a war of words that's going to slow down the whole process?Well, I think you have to expect that there would be some trouble. And the Senate Minority Leader can say that. But he was here during the last 12 years when other Presidents and the Congress quadrupled the national debt. I'm trying to do something about it and turn it around and go in the opposite direction. The surveys show that a big majority of the American people support my initiative. The response from people and governments around the world, it's been almost uniformly positive that America's trying to change the nature of its economic policy, reduce its debt, increase investment in high growth items. And I never expected this to be easy. This is a fundamental change. I don't expect it to be easy. But I hope that I'll be working with Senator Dole and with others to bring it to a successful conclusion. # can I follow up on that, Mr. President? Prime Minister Mulroney of Canada # [Inaudible]&mdash;Canada? Have you spoken to the Prime Minister? Yes, I spoke to the Prime Minister of Canada. We had a very nice conversation, which was mostly personal. And I thanked him for his kindness to me. And he assured me that his country would continue to work with me and that he would personally until his tenure in office was over. I wish him well. He seemed to be a person who had worked through this and was very much at peace with himself today. Prime Minister Major. Can I just answer that point as well? I regard Brian as an old friend and a good friend. I shall miss him. He's been a very good friend to the United Kingdom and a very good friend to the Commonwealth. So I'm sad to hear of his decision today. It must be his decision. I wish him well in the future, and I look forward to seeing him in the United Kingdom in a few weeks' time. Northern Ireland # Mr. Prime Minister, do you think there's any constructive role the United States can play in solving the Northern Ireland problem? Prime Minister Major. I think from time to time distinguished visitors from the United States in Northern Ireland have come back to the United States, and they have actually explained the remarkable changes that have taken part in Belfast. There was a delegation that was there recently. And the reality is that anyone who knew the place 10 years ago and knows the place today will see there is an absolute and total sea change. And I think the fact that there is a great knowledge about the willful peace amongst people in Northern Ireland and especially the ordinary people of Northern Ireland of both sides of the sectarian divide, the more that is understood, the better. And what is actually needed in Northern Ireland to help speed that is more understanding of the process, more support for the talks, more investment for job creation, and less money to fund terrorism. And the more people know about that, the nearer we come to a solution.Press Secretary Myers. Thank you.",clinton
"Prime Minister Mulroney and I had a good conversation following his announcement that he is stepping down as Prime Minister of Canada. Prime Minister Mulroney has been a good friend and partner of the United States, and I wish him well. The Free Trade Agreement, the NAFTA, and Canada's voice in helping to move the world into a more hopeful era are all testimony to his leadership and courage. It was a pleasure to meet with the Prime Minister earlier this month and to speak with him several times since my election. I greatly appreciated the Prime Minister's insight and wise counsel in tackling the common challenges of promoting world economic growth and peace. My meeting with him reinforced my conviction that Canadian engagement in world affairs remains as vital as ever. That our meeting was my first as President underscores the close relationship between our two countries. Our enduring friendship is based on the common vision we share of peace and democratic principles. From peacekeepers in Bosnia and Somalia to partnership in the G-7 and in NATO, Canada has been a true global ally. Both our people benefit from our important trading relationship, with $200 billion in goods and services alone exchanged each year. Our steadfast relationship with Canada is an indispensable element in the essential continuity of American foreign policy. As the Prime Minister and the people of Canada prepare for the road ahead, I want them to know that the United States is and will remain their friend and partner. Our cooperation will continue to grow in the years ahead.",clinton
"My fellow citizens, today we celebrate the mystery of American renewal. This ceremony is held in the depth of winter, but by the words we speak and the faces we show the world, we force the spring, a spring reborn in the world's oldest democracy that brings forth the vision and courage to reinvent America. When our Founders boldly declared America's independence to the world and our purposes to the Almighty, they knew that America, to endure, would have to change; not change for change's sake but change to preserve America's ideals: life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness. Though we marched to the music of our time, our mission is timeless. Each generation of Americans must define what it means to be an American. On behalf of our Nation, I salute my predecessor, President Bush, for his half-century of service to America. And I thank the millions of men and women whose steadfastness and sacrifice triumphed over depression, fascism, and communism. Today, a generation raised in the shadows of the cold war assumes new responsibilities in a world warmed by the sunshine of freedom but threatened still by ancient hatreds and new plagues. Raised in unrivaled prosperity, we inherit an economy that is still the world's strongest but is weakened by business failures, stagnant wages, increasing inequality, and deep divisions among our own people. When George Washington first took the oath I have just sworn to uphold, news traveled slowly across the land by horseback and across the ocean by boat. Now, the sights and sounds of this ceremony are broadcast instantaneously to billions around the world. Communications and commerce are global. Investment is mobile. Technology is almost magical. And ambition for a better life is now universal. We earn our livelihood in America today in peaceful competition with people all across the Earth. Profound and powerful forces are shaking and remaking our world. And the urgent question of our time is whether we can make change our friend and not our enemy. This new world has already enriched the lives of millions of Americans who are able to compete and win in it. But when most people are working harder for less; when others cannot work at all; when the cost of health care devastates families and threatens to bankrupt our enterprises, great and small; when the fear of crime robs law-abiding citizens of their freedom; and when millions of poor children cannot even imagine the lives we are calling them to lead, we have not made change our friend. We know we have to face hard truths and take strong steps, but we have not done so; instead, we have drifted. And that drifting has eroded our resources, fractured our economy, and shaken our confidence. Though our challenges are fearsome, so are our strengths. Americans have ever been a restless, questing, hopeful people. And we must bring to our task today the vision and will of those who came before us. From our Revolution to the Civil War, to the Great Depression, to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history. Thomas Jefferson believed that to preserve the very foundations of our Nation, we would need dramatic change from time to time. Well, my fellow Americans, this is our time. Let us embrace it. Our democracy must be not only the envy of the world but the engine of our own renewal. There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America. And so today we pledge an end to the era of deadlock and drift, and a new season of American renewal has begun. To renew America, we must be bold. We must do what no generation has had to do before. We must invest more in our own people, in their jobs, and in their future, and at the same time cut our massive debt. And we must do so in a world in which we must compete for every opportunity. It will not be easy. It will require sacrifice, but it can be done and done fairly, not choosing sacrifice for its own sake but for our own sake. We must provide for our Nation the way a family provides for its children. Our Founders saw themselves in the light of posterity. We can do no less. Anyone who has ever watched a child's eyes wander into sleep knows what posterity is. Posterity is the world to come: the world for whom we hold our ideals, from whom we have borrowed our planet, and to whom we bear sacred responsibility. We must do what America does best: offer more opportunity to all and demand more responsibility from all. It is time to break the bad habit of expecting something for nothing from our Government or from each other. Let us all take more responsibility not only for ourselves and our families but for our communities and our country. To renew America, we must revitalize our democracy. This beautiful Capital, like every capital since the dawn of civilization, is often a place of intrigue and calculation. Powerful people maneuver for position and worry endlessly about who is in and who is out, who is up and who is down, forgetting those people whose toil and sweat sends us here and pays our way. Americans deserve better. And in this city today there are people who want to do better. And so I say to all of you here: Let us resolve to reform our politics so that power and privilege no longer shout down the voice of the people. Let us put aside personal advantage so that we can feel the pain and see the promise of America. Let us resolve to make our Government a place for what Franklin Roosevelt called bold, persistent experimentation, a Government for our tomorrows, not our yesterdays. Let us give this Capital back to the people to whom it belongs. To renew America, we must meet challenges abroad as well as at home. There is no longer a clear division between what is foreign and what is domestic. The world economy, the world environment, the world AIDS crisis, the world arms race: they affect us all. Today, as an older order passes, the new world is more free but less stable. Communism's collapse has called forth old animosities and new dangers. Clearly, America must continue to lead the world we did so much to make. While America rebuilds at home, we will not shrink from the challenges nor fail to seize the opportunities of this new world. Together with our friends and allies, we will work to shape change, lest it engulf us. When our vital interests are challenged or the will and conscience of the international community is defied, we will act, with peaceful diplomacy whenever possible, with force when necessary. The brave Americans serving our Nation today in the Persian Gulf, in Somalia, and wherever else they stand are testament to our resolve. But our greatest strength is the power of our ideas, which are still new in many lands. Across the world we see them embraced, and we rejoice. Our hopes, our hearts, our hands are with those on every continent who are building democracy and freedom. Their cause is America's cause. The American people have summoned the change we celebrate today. You have raised your voices in an unmistakable chorus. You have cast your votes in historic numbers. And you have changed the face of Congress, the Presidency, and the political process itself. Yes, you, my fellow Americans, have forced the spring. Now we must do the work the season demands. To that work I now turn with all the authority of my office. I ask the Congress to join with me. But no President, no Congress, no Government can undertake this mission alone. My fellow Americans, you, too, must play your part in our renewal. I challenge a new generation of young Americans to a season of service: to act on your idealism by helping troubled children, keeping company with those in need, reconnecting our torn communities. There is so much to be done; enough, indeed, for millions of others who are still young in spirit to give of themselves in service, too. In serving, we recognize a simple but powerful truth: We need each other, and we must care for one another. Today we do more than celebrate America. We rededicate ourselves to the very idea of America, an idea born in revolution and renewed through two centuries of challenge; an idea tempered by the knowledge that, but for fate, we, the fortunate, and the unfortunate might have been each other; an idea ennobled by the faith that our Nation can summon from its myriad diversity the deepest measure of unity; an idea infused with the conviction that America's long, heroic journey must go forever upward. And so, my fellow Americans, as we stand at the edge of the 21st century, let us begin anew with energy and hope, with faith and discipline. And let us work until our work is done. The Scripture says, And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not. From this joyful mountaintop of celebration we hear a call to service in the valley. We have heard the trumpets. We have changed the guard. And now, each in our own way and with God's help, we must answer the call. Thank you, and God bless you all.",clinton
"Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Secretary Bentsen, other members of the Cabinet and distinguished Members of the House and Senate of both parties, and the business men and women and the bankers who are here today. I am in debt to many people in this room and throughout this country who raised to me in many ways, over the 16 months in which I was engaged in the campaign for the Presidency, the question of the credit crunch. From the beginnings of that campaign in New Hampshire, across the country to Illinois and Michigan, down to Florida, across to California, and in all points in between, I repeatedly ran into small business men and women, I repeatedly met bankers themselves who said they wished that something could be done to open up credit again to creditworthy loans, to generate jobs in the private sector. Today we are taking a step to speed the economic recovery that will increase jobs by increasing access to credit for the main engine of our economy, small and medium-sized businesses. At the same time, by strengthening our banking system, our plan will move us beyond the banking problems of the last decade. The initiative avoids the regulatory excess and duplication we've seen and focuses on real risks within our financial institutions and on fair lending, equal opportunity, and credit availability. Every day, small business is a big part of all of our lives. It's the coffee shop on the corner, the florist down the street, the stationery store that carries office supplies, the dry cleaner, the contractor who will remodel a kitchen. Many are businesses with fewer than 100 employees. Many more employ fewer than 20 people. But they keep communities and neighborhoods vibrant and vital. They are the industry in a cottage, in a garage, in a spare bedroom. They are downtown in every town, and sometimes they grow into very large enterprises indeed. Small business includes small farms, the agricultural community. Their contribution is evident every day on our tables. But it is much more. They are the cultivators of an essential part of our history, our heritage, our culture. Small business is also high tech, the industries of tomorrow, from computer software to communications, to biotechnology and environmental testing, all enterprises that create high-wage, high-skill jobs for Americans today, and they will be there tomorrow. And small business has been the route to a better life for immigrants who set up a family business, for men and women who save as they work for others until they can venture off on their own. Often a small business is actually an outgrowth of the global economy. As larger firms downsize to remain competitive, they contract out to smaller firms. And many talented people who once worked for large companies are now going off on their own to seize opportunities in smaller enterprises, building businesses for themselves. Owning one's own business is a cornerstone of the American dream, fortified by hard work, determination, and creativity. My first experience in life with business was in my grandfather's little grocery store. He was the symbol of hope and opportunity to many people with whom he dealt in many ways, 6 days a week at all hours of the day and night. Today's small businesses are a barometer of the economic recovery. And as the strength of this recovery has been diluted by the inability to create jobs, it is clear that it's largely because small companies are still having a hard time. If you look at this chart here, you can see the number of small business failures, just since 1985:119,000 in '85-'86; 118,000 the next year; 111,000 in the next 2-year period; but in '91-'92, almost 185,000 small business failures. These businesses have been hit especially hard by the recession and by a problem not of their own making that can be summarized by two fearsome but now well-worn words: credit crunch. Small companies are simply unable in too many cases to get loans from banks. And I want to show this&mdash;they turned it, and I didn't see&mdash;if you look here, the growth in commercial and industrial loans, '85-'86, in billions of dollars; and the last 2 years, down to a negative $36 billion. Now, if these businesses can't begin or expand or try new ventures, that means stagnation for our economy, lost opportunity, and sometimes ruin for entrepreneurs. Indeed, I've met business people in this country in the last year and a half who've never missed a payment on a loan and still had the loans canceled. These problems are America's problems. When small businesses aren't prospering, they create fewer jobs, and that means fewer jobs for America. If you look at this last chart, you will see the real essence of why this has turned out to be, so far, a jobless recovery. In '85-'86, there was a positive change in small business employment of 2.4 million; '87-'88, 2.8 million; '89-'90, 3.2 million; but down in '91-'92, 400,000. Now, in every year of the 1980's the Fortune 500 companies have reduced employment by several hundred thousand people a year in the United States. But all during the eighties that reduction was more than offset by the creation of new jobs in the small business sector, until the last couple of years. If you had to put in a sentence why this has been a jobless recovery, it's because small business job creation hasn't offset big business job losses. And that is the central challenge we face. As we take advantage of the incredible things going on now in the big and small business sector with productivity increases, with the aggregate indications that we're in an economic recovery, we have to look for ways, all of us together, to try to help to spur small business and medium-size business job growth so that we can put some jobs back into these impressive economic figures of the last quarter. Nearly two-thirds of all of our workers are employed by small businesses. And as I said, millions of jobs in the last decade were created by them, even as larger employers were downsizing, contracting out, or moving employment offshore. We cannot afford not to try to resume this trend in the 1990's. We know that if we create a reliable and secure system of credit for America's small businesses, they'll create jobs for Americans and profits for themselves. That's why we have offered incentives like investment tax credits for small employers, the new business capital gains tax, urban enterprise zones, and a network of small business community development banks. In our country you can become successful if you have a better idea that you can turn into reality. But that reality can only occur if credit is available, for most Americans. And we think we have a better idea for getting lenders and creditworthy borrowers together. What we propose does not involve any changes in legislation. These steps can be taken quickly because they have been agreed to already by the four Federal bank and thrift regulatory agencies: the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of Thrift Supervision. Today I'll outline the basics of the plan, but the four bank and thrift regulators are issuing a joint interagency policy statement today that sets out more of the details. It will be available to all of you, and most of you will understand it. I don't know if I left the implication that I didn't. What we have done, first of all, is to reexamine our examination system, a system that bankers often felt has become too excessive in the wake of the banking and savings and loan failures of the eighties. With this plan our examiners will be directed to do what they do best and not to spend endless hours on pointless paperwork. It will strengthen our oversight by shifting our regulatory attention from unproductive and repetitive procedures, redirecting our resources to better use so that bank examiners will be able to seek out the real risks in today's environment. They'll go after bad loans and troubled banks. That means improved safety and soundness. But they will reduce the credit crunch because they will reduce attention to things that do not deserve them. We will not, I will say again, we will not reduce attention to important regulation or to proper reserves for problem loans. The plan will not lower the capital requirements established in accordance with international standards. It will not cause a single bank to fail. And it will not cost the deposit insurance funds one dollar. Through a proper allocation of our regulatory resources, we will be able to focus more on examination procedures to further meaningful compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act and to promote fair opportunities for all of our people while reducing the hassles for all creditworthy loans. Above all, borrowers can go to their banks expecting fair and equal treatment and a reasonable application process. Fairness is a goal for many good reasons, including the fact that women and other minorities have been very bullish for small business and for America. Female-owned companies now employ 11 1/2 million Americans. A side effect of the savings and loan disaster was a reaction that forced many banks into a thinking mode that didn't distinguish between a good risk and a bad risk where small businesses were concerned. They were afraid to. This was a problem, especially for community bankers who frequently had to decide whether they could loan money to other members in their own community. Even if a banker could personally vouch that an applicant was a person of good character with an unblemished credit record and a good business track record, a loan might still be turned down because the banker felt his hands were tied by tight restrictions. So while we ask bankers to give the small business men and women credit, we'll give the bankers some credit too, as they consider loans to small and medium-size companies in their own communities and neighborhoods. They'll be encouraged to use their judgment to determine whether a borrower is creditworthy. And we're telling bankers that as long as their institutions and their practices are sound, they shouldn't be afraid of the regulator. If they disagree with a decision by a regulator, they'll now have a recourse, a workable and prompt appeals process. To bankers across the Nation we say, you are a pillar of our neighborhoods and communities. We know the demands of rebounding from the last decade have often been painful for many of you. Your comeback has been nothing short of amazing. But there is more work to do. And we need you to get it done. And if it gets done, there will be something to show for it, the kind of broad-based economic growth that benefits all of us. And we further say to bankers across the land that if you make sensible loans, the Government should not come down on you. That's why we're taking this action today. We want bankers to get back into the business of lending money, and we're going to work with them to make it happen. We're also making clear that taking collateral as part of a business loan should not be so burdensome or costly to discourage borrowers or lenders from making sound credit decisions. Often the only collateral a would-be borrower can offer is real estate. Of course, we learned the hard way in the eighties that we had to be careful where loans involving commercial real estate are concerned. But care has been confused with regulatory excess that has been too much of a burden for everyone. The changes we propose will strike a balance so that we can have both safety and credit availability. These changes will also address the paper crunch in getting a small business loan. It simply shouldn't be as burdensome to get a $25,000 loan as it is to get a $25 million loan. It makes no sense for a small or medium-sized business borrower, or for an individual for that matter, to be required in every case to produce a pile of paper like this one&mdash;pretty thick&mdash;when a loan can be made safely in many cases, particularly by banks who have demonstrated judgment in their business practices, with merely a promissory note and a financial statement and possibly a short credit application like this. So under the current system, the paperwork-and I expect every one of you to come back and show me your measured envelopes here. We've got to prove that the difference is what we're asserting it is today. Under the current system, the paperwork is often daunting to the applicant and discourages banks from making smaller loans. Streamlining the process will make it easier to free up credit without compromising security. This is action that everyone, conscientious regulators, community-conscious banks, and growing businesses, can embrace. With this approach we want to marry the ingredients for a thriving business climate. Right now banks are healthier than they've been in years; 1990 was a record year for bank profitability. And these profits have been used to put banks in the strongest position they've been in, in a quarter of a century. At the same time, interest rates have gone down. Just 3 years ago the average interest rate on a small business loan was 12 percent. So far the average is 8 percent. The climate for business ventures has been made even sunnier by economic growth that we've seen in the last quarter. That's a byproduct of the optimism for the growth that we are pressing for now with all the economic initiatives that are before the Congress and the country. So both supply and demand for business loans are there. And would-be small business owners are right to feel they have the wind at their backs. Now that we have banks in the strongest positions they've been in in a quarter century, they ought to be able to give us the strongest economic boost we've had for small business in a quarter century. Until now the problem has been that everyone has had to face a 10-foot wall called the credit crunch. This action that this administration is taking today should take a big chunk out of that wall. The result should be a flow of billions of dollars of economic stimulus that doesn't cost the American taxpayers one red cent. The payoff will be in new jobs and in reversing the charts that I have shown you today. At the same time, by encouraging new small business ventures, we'll be laying the groundwork for a smarter work force that can compete more effectively in the global economy. Getting financing to these businesses is absolutely essential to the future growth of America. We'll see the benefits, and so will our children. This administration is firmly and unequivocally committed to the private sector as the engine of economic growth in America. We have no illusions, no abstractions, no preoccupations; we know that this is what works in this country. In America we put people first, first by having a prosperous economy founded on a thriving private sector. What's good for America is good for business, and we are determined to make the climate for business and for growth better and better and better, beginning today where so many of you have told me for so long we ought to begin, with a real assault on the credit crunch.Thank you very much.",clinton
"Thank you very much. I want to say a special word of thanks to the people from Westinghouse who greeted me when I arrived: Gary Clark, who introduced me, Dick Linder, Gladys Green, Rich O'Leary, and Gary Eder. And thank you to all of you who made this tour possible. I want to thank the Members of the United States Congress who are here, who have worked very hard for a long time and before I became President to help to design a plan to strengthen our economy even as we reduce military spending. Your Senators, Barbara Mikulski and Paul Sarbanes, are here. Your Congressman, Ben Cardin, is here. Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico; Senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein of California; Senator Bill Cohen of Maine; Senator Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island; Congressman Martin Frost of Texas; Congresswoman Jane Harman of California; and Congressman Tom Foglietta of Pennsylvania. I think that is the entire delegation here, along with Mayor Kurt Schmoke of Baltimore and Governor Schaefer. I'm glad to see all of them. I have to note here, you can tell who the best politician is. Of all these people I've introduced, only Senator Mikulski found a seat. I'd also like to thank the members of my Cabinet who have helped to work on the statement that I will announce today who are here: the Defense Secretary Les Aspin, Labor Secretary Bob Reich, Veterans Affairs Director Jesse Brown, Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary, Commerce Secretary Ron Brown. I want to thank all of them for their work. All of you know from personal experience how much American industry has been changed by the cutbacks in defense. Defense spending peaked in 1985. And by 1997, it will have been reduced approximately 40 percent, perhaps more, from its 1985 peak. These changes have led not only to reductions in military personnel abroad and closings of bases at home but dramatic changes in military contracting that have affected companies like this one and which have affected the economies of the States of California, Connecticut, Texas, and many others. It has been said that while change is certain, progress is not. And that certainly is true when it comes to the challenge of meeting the national economic goals that we have in the face of cutbacks in military spending. As I said, these cutbacks have been made since 1985; more are to come. They are essential in a world in which we need funds to be reinvested in the domestic economy and in which the security threats we meet today, while very serious, are different and clearly less expensive than those we faced when the Soviet Union and the United States faced each other across the Berlin Wall with the barriers of the cold war and the imminent prospect of nuclear war. So these changes had to come. But if we do nothing in the face of change, we have learned the hard way that we are its victims. If we take bold action, we can be the beneficiaries of change. All of you here at Westinghouse Electronic Systems Group are proof that you can make change your friend. In 1986, just 16 percent of the work done here was nondefense. Today, it's 27 percent. By 1995, half or more of your work will be nondefense. What you have done here is what I wish to do nationally: take some of the most talented people in the world who produce some of the most sophisticated military technology and put that to work in the civilian economy. The military surveillance technology I have seen here can now be used to help commercial airlines avoid wind shears. Military security technology can now be used to help police officers on the streets and in their patrol cars to be safer and to solve crimes and to find missing children more rapidly. State-of-the-art batteries is helping here to develop an electric car which may well provide an enormous opportunity for America to become more energy-independent and to dramatically reduce the pollution of our atmosphere, at a time when we have been reminded anew that there really is a hole in the ozone layer and there really are problems with unlimited emissions of CO2. Clearly, defense conversion can be done and can be done well, making change our friend and not our enemy. But in order to do it we must act, act decisively, act intelligently, and not simply react years after the cuts occur. Last year, when a candidate for President, I outlined a plan to create new jobs in the civilian economy. Anticipating this challenge, farsighted Members of Congress appropriated approximately $1.5 billion for defense conversion last year, including ideas that literally came from the minds and the efforts of some of the Members of Congress who are here with us today. They've demonstrated aggressiveness in adapting to change. But until today, in spite of that act, none of the money appropriated by Congress was released, and there was no comprehensive plan for what to do with it. Today I want to explain how we're going to put your money to work to put Americans to work and how we're planning for the future by investing in our people, encouraging our companies, and assisting our communities. Our first priority has to be investing in our people. Keep in mind, as you all know here, when the defense budget is reduced, that affects, obviously, contracts and therefore the jobs of people who work in the private sector. It also affects the size of the military force itself, the configuration of our defense forces abroad and here at home, and the people who will be affected by the reductions. Our defense reinvestment and conversion initiative will rededicate $375 million right away to help working people affected by defense reductions with employment services, job training, and transition assistance; $150 million of that will go to Government and employer-sponsored job training programs; $112 million will help members of the Guard and the Reserves make the transition to civilian life and to provide severance pay and health benefits to civilians who are leaving Government employment. There's also initiative to provide early retirement benefits for military personnel with 15 years of service or more, to start a new program to encourage them to put their skills to work in vital areas like teaching, law enforcement, environmental restoration, and health care. Under a provision offered by Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, any member of the military who is being mustered out with 15 years or more of service can go to work in law enforcement, for example, and earn a year of military retirement for every year they were in law enforcement, so that these people who have committed their lives to the service of our country and could not reasonably have known that this reduction would occur and would affect them can still earn their military retirement by serving their country here at home. We must also recognize the ripple effect of defense adjustment and target assistance to our communities. In 1993 alone, we will triple the budget of the Defense Department's Office of Economic Adjustment. The $30 million we've committed to this task will be invested in helping our communities find the tools and the expertise to adjust to the changed nature of their local economy. It will be an investment that pays off in the long-term. In addition, through the Commerce Department, we'll invest another $80 million in a revolving loan and grant program to directly and immediately aid communities hit hardest by defense cuts. Finally, the Secretary of Defense has assured me that he will do everything he can to speed the environmental cleanup on bases that are closed so that they can be turned over either to commercial purposes or to local government at the earliest possible time so that there will be a minimum loss of economic activity in areas where bases are closed. But all the worker training in the world and all the community assistance in the word will do no good if there are no jobs for those workers and no businesses for those communities. The private sector is the engine of lasting economic growth in our system, and therefore, our plan must help our companies to make these transitions to compete and to win. We seek to go beyond the debate of the past in which some thought Government alone could do everything and others claimed Government could do nothing. In this area there are two things Government can do to aid companies like this one: promote dual use research and promote civilian use of technology that was formerly developed for military purposes. That is what you have done here. We want to speed and expand that process all across the United States. One of the success stories of the cold war was the Defense Advanced Research Agency, or DARPA. DARPA helped keep America on the cutting edge of defense research. To meet the new challenges of the new world, we're giving DARPA a new mission and restoring its old name, because before 1972 that Agency was known simply as the Advanced Research Products Agency. By going back to that name and refocusing the Agency's efforts on dual use technologies, such as that which you have demonstrated to me here today, rather than strictly military applications, we'll be better able to integrate research to strengthen defense and to promote our economic security here at home. Starting now, this Agency, ARPA, will allocate more than $500 million to technology and industrial programs like the ones we've seen here today. We'll support industry-led consortia and dual use technologies and promote efforts to break through with commercial uses of formerly defense technologies. Programs will be selected on the basis of merit and will require matching funds from the corporations affected. We're even going to set up a toll-free number to attract good ideas from good companies. And you will like this. The number is 1-800-DUALUSE. The hot line will be hooked up tomorrow, so don't call today. To help walk companies through their new opportunities, ARPA will provide them with this book, which puts together programs from the Defense Department, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Energy, NASA, and the National Science Foundation. It is a remarkable coalition of Agencies finally putting all the information together for defense technology conversion, reinvestment, and transition assistance. To further coordinate assistance, ARPA will work with four other Agencies, the ones I just mentioned. And we're going to have a series of regional outreach meetings all across this country, again, to try to mobilize other companies to get involved in this initiative so that they can save or create jobs instead of lose jobs in the face of defense reductions. We want Government-industry partnerships to help develop advanced materials. We want companies to form regional technology alliances so they can share information and develop new products and new markets. Our manufacturing extension programs will help bring state-of-the-art technology to companies in much the same way as the Agricultural Extension Service helped our farmers more than two generations ago begin to become the most productive in the world. And through the Small Business Innovation Research Program, we'll help small businesses in their efforts to develop dual use technology. But dual use technology is just the beginning. We have to explore also new opportunities in purely civilian technologies. This year alone, we'll invest $300 million in emerging nondefense technology. The Department of Energy will speed the transfer of technology to private industry from our national labs. And when Congress passes the stimulus package I have proposed, we'll have millions more to invest in research and development partnerships, in advanced technology programs, and in computer networks for schools and libraries around the country. As with every aspect of the program for change I have asked the American people and the Congress to embrace, defense conversion will require us to literally reimagine and reinvent the way Government works. I've asked the National Economic Council to take the lead in our efforts to streamline and coordinate our conversion efforts so that you don't have to deal with a big bureaucracy where all the information is in many different places and sometimes seems to be operating at cross purposes. Shifting to a civilian economy is of obvious concern to the Defense Department, but it's also the business of the Commerce Department, the Labor Department, the Energy Department, NASA, and many other agencies, including the Department of Veterans Affairs, which will have even more veterans now as people are coming out of the service and going into the civilian work force. Our National Economic Council will cut through red tape, break through turf battles, and help to deliver services to our customers quickly and efficiently. I don't pretend that this will be easy, and all of it will take some time. But the choice we face is between bold action to build a stronger and safer and smarter America, or continuing to cut defense with no appropriate response or with one that is too localized and too limited. The soldier-statesman Dwight Eisenhower once observed that the resourceful American makers of plowshares could, with time and as required, make swords as well. Our challenge is now to reverse the process. You have given us a stunning example of just how brilliantly that can be done here in this fine facility. I know today that the world's finest makers of swords can and will be the finest makers of plowshares, and they will lead America into a new century of strength, growth, and opportunity.Thank you very much.",clinton
"Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies Subject: Resolution of Puerto Rico's Status Although Puerto Rico was acquired in connection with the Spanish-American War and United States citizenship is granted to persons born on the islands, Puerto Rico's ultimate status has not been determined. Until that issue is resolved, questions remain about how United States economic and social policies should apply to the citizens of Puerto Rico. Further, although our citizens in Puerto Rico have been granted the exercise of authority on local matters similar to that of citizens of a State, they do not have voting representation in the Federal Government. All three of Puerto Rico's major political parties are based on different visions of what the options for a fully democratic status are, and what the best status would be. And all advocate a substantial change in the islands' status. The Commonwealth held a referendum on options for its future status in December 1998, including the current governing arrangement, and other recognized options, but a majority of the vote was for a None of the Above column. Much of the debate on the issue concerns what options are available to Puerto Rico, in light of the Constitution and the basic laws and policies of the United States. The elected representatives of the people of Puerto Rico have, therefore, repeatedly petitioned the Federal Government to clarify the islands' status options as well as the process by which Puerto Ricans can determine the islands' future status. The United States has a responsibility to answer such questions. Successive Presidents, and the Congress in 1998, have supported the people of Puerto Rico in determining their status preference from among options that are not incompatible with the Constitution and basic laws and policies of the United States. I have made it the policy of the executive branch to work with the leaders of the Commonwealth and the Congress to enable Puerto Ricans to choose their future status. We also have the responsibility to help Puerto Ricans obtain the necessary transitional legislation toward a new status, if chosen. To ensure that the Federal Government continues to address the fundamental question concerning the islands until it is resolved, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including Public Law 106-346, I have today issued an Executive Order establishing the President's Task Force on Puerto Rico's Status (President's Task Force) and further direct as follows: <blockquote 1. The Co-Chairs of the President's Task Force shall conduct an ongoing dialogue with the Governor and Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico's major political parties and other groups that advocate a change in the islands' status, and the Chairs and Ranking Minority Members of the House of Representatives Committee on Resources and the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. This dialogue shall focus on the options for Puerto Rico's future status and the process by which Puerto Ricans can realize such an option. It shall seek to facilitate communications among the offices that the aforementioned officials represent on matters relating to the status of the Commonwealth, and ensure official attention to, and facilitate action on, such matters. In particular, the dialogue shall seek to clarify the options for Puerto Rico's future status and enable Puerto Ricans to choose among those options. 2. The Co-Chairs of the President's Task Force shall monitor the expenditure of funds for public education on and a public choice among Puerto Rico's status options pursuant to Public Law 106-346. This monitoring shall include ensuring that educational materials are accurate, objective, and nonpartisan and that they are consistent with the standards set forth in the Executive Order entitled Establishment of the President's Task Force on Puerto Rico's Status. 3. The heads of executive departments and agencies shall cooperate with the Co-Chairs in fulfilling the assignments provided for herein and in the accompanying Executive Order. </blockquote",clinton
"Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, distinguished members of the Children's Defense Fund board, Secretary Reich, and Secretary Riley. Did you see the way Secretary Reich rushed out when they said the President of the United States? That's not true. I pushed him through the door so I could get a laugh out of it. My dear friend Marian Wright Edelman, as usual, your introduction has left me nothing to say. I will say this: I know a lot of people will come here and tell you how much they appreciate people who are children's advocates. Not very many people appreciate it enough to marry one, and I did. I also have savaged the ranks of the CDF board. My wife had to resign because she was married to a Presidential candidate. And then Donna Shalala had to resign because I gave her a job&mdash; -which on Sunday she'd probably rather swap for being chair of the Children's Defense Fund board. I am delighted to be here. I look out on this crowd and I see many old friends. You know, a lot of people ask me what it's like to be President. And I don't know if I can explain it, but it is different. People either want to walk around on tippy-toe or take a baseball bat and whack your head off. There seems to be nothing in between. The other day Hillary had a number of people into the White House on the first floor to some sort of meeting, and I got off on the floor, and I had to go someplace else. And all of a sudden, all these people were there. And I walked out into this crowd, and I started shaking their hands. And the guy who was with me said, Oh, Mr. President, I'm so sorry that you had to deal with all those people. I said, That's all right, I used to be one. I hope I will be again some day. Meanwhile, I'm going to depend on you and the American people to keep me just as close to humanity as I possibly can. I've just come from a remarkable event in Maryland with a number of Members of the Congress who are friends of the Children's Defense Fund. We were there; Secretary Reich was there with me; we flew back. And we were at a plant that belongs to Westinghouse. It used to be a defense plant, and it is increasingly becoming a domestic technology plant. And we went there to announce an economic conversion program to try to help more people who are losing their jobs from military cutbacks either in the private or the public sector find new opportunities moving toward the economy of the 21st century. This is a very important thing. We've been reducing defense since 1985, and no nation would so reduce one sector of its economy that provided so many high-wage, high-growth jobs, that was on the cutting edge of new technology-no other nation would ever have done what we've done with no clear strategy for what to do with all those resources, all those people, to try to help to build our economic base. So we will continue to reduce defense, as we must, but we're trying to plan for the future of those people and those incredible resources. I saw military technology turn into an electric car that will drive over 80 miles an hour and which may hold the promise of ending our dependence on foreign oil and cleaning up our atmosphere. I saw a police car with a computer screen with visual imaging developed for defense technology, which can now be used immediately to transmit to police officers who have it pictures of missing children, immediately, while they're in their car. I saw a plane with radar technology which just came back from dealing with the difficult incident in Waco, Texas&mdash;defense technology&mdash;another plane with a different sort of technology now which can be put on all of our commercial air flights to detect wind shears, which is one of the major causes of airline misfortunes now among commercial airlines. I say all this because everybody says, well, that's a great idea, and it's self-evident, and why haven't we been doing this? But it is simply reflective of a problem we have had in this country for some time, which is that we have undervalued the importance of increasing the capacity of our people. We have talked a lot about a lot of things in America. But when you strip it all away and you look at where we have been, sort of out of sync with many other countries and with where we have to go in the future, it is clear that on a broad range of areas, we have simply undervalued the importance of making a commitment to the idea that we don't have a person to waste, that everybody counts, and that what you can do affects not only your future but mine as well. These, of course, are the arguments that the Children's Defense Fund has been making since its inception in its struggles to get a better deal for America's children. They have become far more important arguments in the last decade. In 1985 a remarkable thing happened, a thing altogether laudatory in our country: Our senior citizens became less poor than the rest of us, a thing we can be proud of. People used to have to live in absolute agony wondering what would happen to their parents. You still do if you have long-term care problems. But most elderly people now, because of Social Security and supplemental security income and Medicare and because of the pension reforms of the last several years, can look forward to a security in their later years that 10 or 20 or 30 years ago was utterly unheard of. And it is really a testimony to the farsightedness of our country. However, at the same time, in the same decade, we began to experience a new class of poor people who were dramatically undervalued. They were little children and their poor parents, usually their single poor parents. And they had no advocates in many councils of power. If it hadn't been for the Children's Defense Fund and a few others who walked with them through life, many of the good things which have been done would not have been done. And all the things which were done were not enough to reverse the trends of the 1980's, when the elderly became less poor and the children became more poor. Now, because many of you in this room have continued this fight, and because of the decisions the American people made in the last election, we once again have a chance to invest in the hopes and the dreams of our children. I have asked the United States Congress to embrace a program that recognizes, as was said earlier, that we have two big deficits in this country. We have a huge budget deficit, but we also have a huge investment deficit. It was a cruel irony of the last 12 years that we not only took the Government debt from $1 trillion to $4 trillion, with annual deficits now in excess of $300 million projected for the next few years unless we change it, but we found a way in all of that to actually reduce our investment in our future at the national level. How could it happen? Well, it happened because of a big military buildup. It happened because of a big tax cut early. It happened because health care costs have been completely out of control. It happened because an underperforming economy didn't produce many revenues. But it happened also because there were not enough people who said we must constant]y invest in the most important thing in a modern society, the capacity of the people to be healthy and strong and good. So you have all these anomalies. The United States, the world's strongest economy, has the third worst record in the Western Hemisphere for immunizing its children against preventable childhood diseases. The United States, a country that has dominated the economy of the world for the last half a century, has higher rates of adult illiteracy and school dropout and dysfunction among adults than most of its major competitors, and the highest rate of incarceration of any country in the world, something we rank first in. That bespeaks our inability to make the diversity of our country a source of strength instead of weakness, and to deal with the stark dilemmas of poverty in ways that at least give the children a chance to do better. Well, now we have a chance. The good news is we know a lot about what works. We've known for years through clear studies that, though not perfect, Head Start and WIC and immunizations really do make a difference. We know that if you give children a better life and you strengthen their families, you make the economy stronger and you free up money to be spent on things like that economic conversion program I just visited today. We know that if we focus on people and their capacities, it really does work. That's why I was really pleased that the first bill I signed was the Family and Medical Leave Act because it will, even to those who oppose it, make their businesses more productive, not less, by securing family life and making it possible for people to be good parents. That's why the long-term economic plan and the short-term economic stimulus I asked the Congress to embrace includes funds to put our people first: for 700,000 summer jobs for young people; for the beginnings of summer Head Start programs where they don't exist; for beginning to set up the infrastructure of immunization where it isn't, so that we can start to do the work that has to be done. We have simply got to invest in our people in ways that work. Marian has already said it, but I will reiterate. This budget, if funded by the Congress, will fully fund Head Start and WIC, will create a network of immunization efforts which will permit us to finally immunize our little children against preventable childhood diseases, something that will save, over the long run, 10 bucks for every dollar we put into it. How do you explain, I mean, how can you possibly justify to anybody that our country, with the power of its economy, that produces the vast majority of vaccines produced anywhere in the world, is better only than Bolivia and Haiti in this hemisphere in immunizing our children? And you know, you have to have a certain core of immunization to make sure that there will be no outbreak of diseases. We are dangerously, perilously close to falling below that core of immunized children in many different areas. This is a big deal, folks. So I hope that we will have this attitude now that we ought to invest as we cut the deficit. The plan that I presented to the Congress reduces the deficit dramatically, has 150 specific budget cuts, starts with an example from the White House staff. We cut the staff in the next fiscal year 25 percent below the staffing levels that I found when I came. We cut $9 billion out of the administrative costs of Federal agencies. And I mean they're real cuts; they're going into the budget. They cannot be escaped. I'm glad you're clapping for that, you know, because the people that are attacking me act like anybody that wants any money from the Government just loves all that bureaucracy you have to put up with. I know better. It's good for you to clap. We also raised some tax money. I saw the proof of an article by David Stockman coming out in a magazine soon which talked about how the clear problem is that the tax base of this country was dramatically, fundamentally, and permanently eroded in 1981, that Social Security's about the same percentage of gross national product today it was back in 1981. So we have to raise some more money if we want to reduce the debt. But we also try to reverse the investment gap in things that you didn't come here to talk about, like transportation and clean water and better sewage systems, in things that will strengthen the environment and put people to work and increase our productivity, in things like community development operations to add jobs to high unemployment areas, in national service, which Marian mentioned, and in other areas that will increase the capacity of people to work, to grow, to learn, to flourish. Now, there are people, believe it or not, who, number one, don't want to pass a stimulus package at all because they say the economy's great&mdash;that's because most people in Washington are employed; talk to them about that, will you&mdash; &mdash;and who think that this program would be even better if it didn't have any new investment at all. Now, to be fair to those people, there are basically three lines of attack. You're going to the Hill. I want you to know I need your help. I need your help because there are a lot of people without jobs; there are a lot of people without adequate jobs. Most of the new jobs created in this last round&mdash;365,000 last month-hallelujah, that's great, but more than half of them were part-time jobs that don't have health care benefits for the kids and the families. You need to know what they are saying, the people against whom you must argue. They will say, number one, We can cut the deficit even more if we just didn't have any investment, or If we didn't pass any of the President's spending programs, we could cut the deficit as much and raise taxes less. The problem with that argument is those people think there is absolutely no difference between putting another child in Head Start and keeping somebody working in an agency when the job is no longer needed and can be phased out, in supporting a regulatory apparatus that bas long since lost its justification, in funding a pork barrel project that can't possibly be justified. In other words, these people think anything the Government spends is equally bad. Educating a kid to go to college is the same as continuing the subsidy for sheep or any other program; no difference. Government spending is Government spending is Government spending. There is no difference.Now, do you believe that in your own lives?Audience members. No-o-o! No. I mean, in your lives, if you take home a check every month, is it the same whether you spend it on making a house payment, making a car payment, saving money for your child's education, or just paying for an extra helping at dinner? Of course not. There are distinctions in the relative impact of how you spend your pay, how your business invests its money, and how your Government invests your money. And so when people tell you there's no difference, tell them that's wrong. And then there is a crowd that say, Well, these programs don't really make any difference. Head Start doesn't work, and there's no proof Head Start works. Now, this is an interesting argument. Most of those who think there's no proof Head Start works still believe trickle-down economics did. Until I proposed phasing in the full funding of this program, many of those who themselves objected had previously voted to expand it. To be fair, President Bush praised Head Start at every turn. A few years ago, Senator Dole introduced his own legislation to expand it. Sure, there are serious criticisms rooted in the fact that this is now not a new program. There are people who say it's not evenly good across the country. That is true. There are people who say it could be managed better. That's true. There are people who say that cognitive improvements don't always last more than 2 years after children stop attending, depending on where they are. That's true. One big deal is how strong the parents' involvement really is. There are those who say there ought to be more school-based programs or more home-based programs, and we've worked hard on that at home. All that's true. That is not an excuse not to fully fund Head Start. Our program will serve more children, but it will also strengthen the quality of Head Start and put some flexibility back into the program so that it can meet the needs of the different communities that are served. But those who choose to ignore the overwhelming evidence of the program's success have an obligation to tell us why more children with high self-esteem and better grades and better thinking skills and better predictable long-term performance is such a bad idea. I think it's a great idea. But we must, in fairness to the criticisms, become our own most severe critics. That's where you come in, because all of you live out there where these programs work. You could give a better criticism of what's wrong with most of these public programs than those who don't want to fund them. Most of you could. So tell them you know it is up to us to be our own most severe critics. I just asked the Vice President to review every program in the Government, come back to me in 6 months with all kinds of other things that we can stop doing or that we can modify or that we can push back to people at the grass roots level. If we who believe in Government don't have the courage to change it, we cannot expect those who don't to help us in our efforts. And this is just the beginning. Just 2 days ago I asked Secretary Shalala to draft a new child welfare initiative to combine family support and family preservation services, to do more to build on the work of Senator Rockefeller and Congressman Matsui and Congresswoman Schroeder and to do more for families at risk, especially those at risk of foster care placement, even as we try to strengthen our efforts to enforce child support enforcement for those who have been abandoned by one parent. Now, there is a third argument against this effort. There are those who say, Yes, Head Start's a good deal; WIC is a good deal; the immunization's a good deal. And yes, we ought to invest as opposed to consume. There is a distinction to be drawn in the way this money is spent, and investment is better, investment in our children, our fixture. But we still ought not to do it because we need even more deficit reduction. And let me say, that is an argument you must treat with respect. We have gone from a $1 trillion deficit to a $4 trillion deficit in 12 years. We have imposed a crushing burden on the present and a bigger one on the future. And if you think about it, it's really an income transfer. Now that we're spending 15 cents of every dollar you pay the Government&mdash;most of you are middle class people, and we spend 15 cents of every dollar you pay the Government paying interest on the debt. Those bonds are largely held by Upper income people. So there are now a lot of liberals in the Congress who are rethinking their old positions on things like the mechanisms by which we move to balance the budget on the theory that we're spending all this money having an income transfer from middle class taxpayers, lower income taxpayers to people who hold the bonds because we didn't have the discipline to run our budgets better. And if we don't do something about the deficit, we just keep on spending like we are, by the end of the decade your annual debt will be $653 billion a year. The interest service will be about 22 cents of your tax dollar. Twenty cents on the dollar of every dollar in America, public and private, will go to health care. So we have to change. But my answer to those who say, Well, let's just don't invest because this deficit is such a big problem, is: Number one, we got into this mess over 12 years, and we have more than 4 years to get out of it. Number two, we are reaping the benefits of the clear and disciplined and determined effort that the congressional leadership has now agreed to make with me to bring the deficit down. We have interest rates at very, very low rates. We have the stock market back up. People say, Hey, this thing is going to work. All of you can now look at whether you should refinance your home or your car. Businesses should refinance their debt. If we get all this debt refinanced in the next year, that will add $80 to $100 billion back in our economy. We are reaping the benefits of a disciplined program to reduce the deficit today. But if we do not also at the same time recognize that for 12 years we have ignored our obligations to invest in our jobs, in our people, in our education, if we don't do that, we will pay for that neglect tomorrow, just like we're paying for yesterday's neglect today. We can do both things. There's another argument you need to make&mdash;and I'm speaking for my wife now, as well as for me which is that if you just cut out all these programs that we believe in, if you just cut them plumb out, you'll still have an increase in the deficit again, starting in about 5 years, because of the explosion in health care costs. The real, ultimate answer to the deficit problem is to bring health care cost in line with inflation and provide a decent system of health care for all Americans. And we can do that. So, with discipline, with a willingness to both cut and tax, with a willingness to reduce consumption expenditures and increase investment in our future, we can do the things that we have to do. But we can't walk away from any of our challenges and expect the results America needs. If we walk away from the health care challenge, it doesn't matter what they do on all these other cuts. You'll be swallowed up in debt in 5 or 6 years again if we walk away from the health care challenge. If we walk away from the challenge to raise some more revenues and cut the spending we must, we'll lose control of our economic destiny even if we spend more money on the programs you want. You'll be raising and educating healthier, more well-educated kids to a weaker economy. But if we reduce the deficit and we forget about the fact that in the world we live in the only thing that really counts is people&mdash;every factory can be moved overseas. Three trillion dollars in money crosses national lines every day. Everything else is mobile except us. We're here. We don't want to move. All we've got's each other now in America. That's what we've got. And if we ignore that, we don't think those little kids that live in the Mississippi Delta, in my home State, many of whom never see a dentist the whole time of their childhood, need a better shot in life because of us as well as them; if we don't believe that those kids that are sitting out there in the barrios in Los Angeles, in the black community, in the Hispanic community, in the Asian-American community, waiting for the resolution of the Rodney King trial only because it stands for everything else that ever happened to them, not because of the trial but because of what it stands for; if we don't think that we need to prove that a county like Los Angeles County with people from 150 different racial and ethnic groups can live together and learn together and grow together and if they play by the rules can have the right to earn a decent living, and we don't think that affects the rest of us, we haven't learned very much in the last 12 years. And so I ask you to do this: I ask you to go to the Congress and ask them to support this program. And go with respect, because I promise you most of these people are trying to come to grips with the dilemmas of this time. And they have gotten one big message: that is that we made a horrible mistake to let the deficit get out of hand like we did in the last 12 years. And they deserve respect for getting that message. And they now have a President who will take the lead and fade some of the heat for the unpopularity of the decisions which have to be made. Go with respect for that. Say, You had to do that, and we respect that. But remind them that out in the country where you live, bringing down the deficit is important if it gives people jobs and raises people's incomes and if there are people out there who can seize the opportunities of the future. And what you represent is the future. You represent the needs of the people who will not be able to perform even with a sensible economic policy unless we do better in health care, in education, and in dealing with the needs of our poorest children. That is what you represent. None of this other stuff will amount to a hill of beans unless we put the American people first in all of these decisions. That is the message I plead with you to bring to the Congress.Thank you, and God bless you all.",clinton
"Thank you very much. Please be seated. We are honored here in the White House to be joined today by distinguished Members of the Senate and the House: Senator Biden, Senator Hatch, Senator Kennedy, Senator Sarbanes, one of Janet Reno's Senators, Senator Connie Mack. Senator Graham called me last night. He's in Florida today with the First Lady at a health care hearing. And he said he had an excused absence from the Attorney General. The Speaker and Congressman Edwards are here, and we're delighted to see all of them. I also would say we're delighted to be joined by Mr. Justice White and Mrs. White. Thank you very much for coming. Let me say that it is a great honor for me to be able to be here at this ceremony today with Janet Reno, her family, and a few of her many friends. I'd like to say a special word of thanks to Stuart Gerson, who has served ably and honorably as Acting Attorney General since the Inauguration. I think we owe him a round of applause. Somehow I don't think any of my other proposals will pass the Senate by the same vote margin&mdash; &mdash;that Janet's confirmation did. I especially want to thank Senator Biden and Senator Hatch and the members of the Judiciary Committee for waiving the normal waiting period between hearings and the confirmation vote, making this event possible today and making it possible for us to proceed immediately with the urgent tasks at hand. But more than anything else, I think it is clear that Janet Reno made her own swift confirmation possible, showing the Senate and all who followed the hearings the qualities of leadership and integrity, intelligence, and humanity that those gathered in this room have recognized for a very long time. You shared with us the life-shaping stories of your family and career that formed your deep sense of fairness and your unwavering drive to help others to do better. You showed us that your career in public service, working on the front lines in your community, fighting crime, understanding the impact on victims and on neighborhoods, mending the gritty social fabric of a vibrant but troubled urban area, is excellent preparation for carrying forward the banner of justice for all the American people. You'll help to guide the Federal Government to assist State and local law enforcement in ways that really count. You demonstrated that you will be a formidable advocate for the vulnerable people in our society and especially for our children. Most of all, you proved to the Nation that you are a strong and an independent person who will give me your best legal judgment whether or not it's what I want to hear. It's an experience I've already had, I'm glad to say. That is the condition upon which you accepted my nomination and the only kind of Attorney General that I would want serving in this Cabinet. As Janet Reno begins her work at the Justice Department, she will enter a building that symbolizes our Nation's commitment to justice, to equality, to the enforcement of our laws. On the side of that building, carved above one of the portals, is the inscription, The halls of justice are a hallowed place. With Janet Reno serving as our Nation's Attorney General, those words will have great meaning for all Americans.",clinton
"Good day, ladies and gentlemen. On this St. Patrick's Day, I am delighted to we]come Prime Minister Reynolds, called Taoiseach in his country, to the White House. We both share a love of music and a love of Ireland, and I'm looking forward to working with him in the years ahead. I accept with honor this beautiful bowl of shamrocks he has presented from the people of Ireland to the people of the United States. And it will be proudly displayed in the White House as a symbol of our shared values and common heritage. The Prime Minister's visit is an opportunity not only to recall our kinship but also to work together on issues of critical importance to both our nations. We just concluded a good meeting which covered many issues, and I benefited greatly from the Prime Minister's advice and counsel. We discussed the importance of bringing the Uruguay round to a successful conclusion. We reviewed the humanitarian relief effort in Somalia, including the generous contributions of Irish citizens working in such organizations as CONCERN and UNICEF. Let me take a moment here, Mr. Prime Minister, to extend to the families and friends of Valerie Place and Sean Devereux the heartfelt condolences of the American people over their tragic deaths and our gratitude for their service. Their dedication to the relief efforts in Somalia will serve as an inspiration to us as we seek to extend the hand of comfort to victims of strife. The Prime Minister and I also discussed the continuing tragic conflict in Northern Ireland that has cost 3,000 lives over the last 2 decades. I congratulate both the Irish and the British Governments for their joint efforts to promote the necessary dialog to bring about a just and lasting peace. And I want to underscore my strong support for that important goal. We agree that such an outcome cannot be coerced or imposed, and that those who resort to violence must not be tolerated. Violence condemns generation to harvest the seeds of bitterness, not peace. Nor can the problem be resolved by the language of victories or defeats. It must be resolved in the language and spirit of compromise and conciliation. I told the Prime Minister that the United States stands ready to do whatever we can to help in bringing peace to Northern Ireland. We are a nation of diversity. We are prepared to help in any way that we can. I think that it is important to say that the most significant thing I should be doing now is to encourage the resumption of the dialog between the Irish and the British Governments, which I think is a critical precondition to any establishment of a lasting peace. Our support for the International Fund for Ireland is an important demonstration of our commitment to encourage investment and economic growth and to advance the cause of peace and tolerance. My discussions with Prime Minister Reynolds, as with Prime Minister Major, were the first of many that I think you will see our governments having as we offer our assistance in trying to end the troubles. Let me close by saying that the ties of culture, history, and friendship between the United States and Ireland mean a great deal to me. Last night the Prime Minister and I joined together in singing When Irish Eyes Are Smiling. He did a slightly better job than I did. Today we pause to renew our ties to Ireland and the challenges ahead. Let me add that Ireland will have a friend in The White House, Mr. Prime Minister, not just on St. Patrick's Day but on every day of the year. I also want to take advantage of the Prime Minister's visit here to announce my intention to nominate as Ambassador to Ireland a distinguished individual, as Irish as Americans can be, Jean Kennedy Smith. I can think of no one who better captures the bonds between Ireland and the United States or who will work harder to advance our relationship. In many ways she's already been an unofficial international ambassador. Since she founded Very Special Arts two decades ago, she has traveled tirelessly throughout the United States and the world. Very Special Arts provides opportunities for the disabled in creative arts in all 50 States and over 50 countries, including Ireland. As a testament to her success, a play from her young playwrights program in Dublin will open shortly off Broadway. I know firsthand Jean's achievements from the Arkansas Very Special Arts program and remember well when Hillary joined her in our State for the competition to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the White House. The people of the United States will be proud of our new Ambassador. I am proud of her, and I'm glad to have a couple of her relatives, the Senator from the State of Massachusetts and Congressman Kennedy, to join with us today. And Mr. Ambassador, let me say again how very grateful we are to you and offer you the opportunity to make a few remarks and then offer Mrs. Smith. Ambassador-Designate Smith. Thank you very much. It is a great honor for me to be nominated as Ambassador to Ireland. And I'm extremely grateful to President Clinton for his confidence in me. I will do all I can to repay this confidence. It's a wonderful St. Patrick's Day. Thank you. Prime Minister Reynolds. Thank you, President. And first of all, may I take the first opportunity of saying&mdash;[at this point, Prime Minister Reynolds spoke in Gaelic]&mdash;which is congratulations to Jean Kennedy Smith to be the U.S. Ambassador to Ireland. The U.S. is proud of her. We are more proud still to welcome home Jean Kennedy Smith. She has been a regular visitor to our shores. She has done marvelous work throughout the world, as the President has just said, in relation to her work for the disabled arts. And I know she'll get plenty of opportunity to continue that creative work in Ireland. Thank you, President. St. Patrick's Day, Mr. President, is an occasion which bonds and brings together our two communities and peoples in a uniquely meaningful way. It is not simply about shamrock and symbols, important though these are; rather does it have as its core a deep, abiding, and shared belief in democracy and freedom and in the protection and extension of human rights. It was because these values were incorporated in the foundation of the American republic that Thomas Jefferson could proclaim in his first Inaugural Address what might then have seemed a paradox, and I quote: I believe this ... the strongest Government on earth. It is a day and this is a unique occasion, standing as we are here in the house which, as President Clinton remarked last night at that very enjoyable function, that this house was designed just over 200 years ago by an Irishman, James Hoban. That's one of the reasons why we are contemplating the extraordinary success of Irish America. You will have no difficulty, Mr. President, if on this day I characterize you, you yourself, as reflecting on that Irish American success story. Like John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, Andrew Jackson, Ulysses S. Grant, and other Presidents of Irish extraction before you, you have risen to the highest position in the land adopted by your ancestors and demonstrated again that the great American dream which inspired so many of your forbears is alive and well and in very good hands. The success story that is Irish America today began as one of political, economic, and social struggle in the home country. It should not be surprising therefore that when the earlier waves of our immigrants reached these shores, they were to the forefront in the American War of Independence and in the drafting and promulgation of the American Declaration of Independence, and that later waves of immigrants quickly and enthusiastically embraced that declaration, to quote just one historian, not as a tired formula, but as an ideal to be reached out for and grasped. It is against that background, Mr. President, that I have always believed that the constructive interest and support of the United States has the potential to be uniquely helpful in finding a solution to the situation in Northern Ireland, that last residual problem of a long and often sad history between Ireland and Britain. My government are determined not to allow another generation to suffer the scourge and savagery of violence or its demeaning and related manifestations: disadvantage, harassment, and discrimination. There are no immediate answers, no simple solutions, but there is a way forward. It involves courage, commitment, and imagination. It will require, above all, the letting go of all vestiges of triumphalism on every side and replacing it with a willingness and a determination to work together in partnership within new structures which will embrace and seek to reconcile the two conflicting rights and aspirations in our small country. We warmly welcome your concern, Mr. President, your commitment, and your active support as we take on this daunting but vital challenge. If we can succeed, Mr. President, in establishing in Ireland structures that achieve these goals, the benefits may not just be for Ireland alone. In a world where deeper ethnic divisions have assumed a new and violent prominence, it may well be that the model we create in Ireland will have application in similar conflict situations around the world. So in conclusion, Mr. President, may I thank you again for the hospitable American reception you have given us here today at the White House. In so doing, you acknowledge and honor the contribution of the millions of fellow Irish who have made their homes and built their dreams in this great land. You make us all proud. As we travel together now for a gathering on Capitol Hill hosted by another outstanding Irishman, Speaker Foley, may I extend to you, Mrs. Clinton, and your family our warmest best wishes on this very special day for all of us and convey our sincerest wish for the success of your administration. I hope Americans of all ethnic backgrounds have a wonderful St. Patrick's Day. And what a day in which to celebrate it here with one of us as President, another, Albert here on my right, and the Kennedy family that are a legend in Ireland, the United States, and throughout the world. That was such an outstanding performance, I think the Prime Minister should have to answer all the questions. Northern Ireland # Have you decided, Mr. President, whether or not to send a peace envoy or to send a fact-finding mission to Northern Ireland? And could you give us some idea of a time frame for that action, please? No, I discussed it with the Prime Minister. And we decided after our consultations that that is certainly an option that I should leave open, both of those options, and have under serious consideration. As you know, talks began last year and then were suspended. I'm very hope fid that the British and the Irish Governments will get back together and begin a serious dialog soon. I think that is a precondition, as I said, for the other talks proceeding. And I'm going to stay in touch closely with Prime Minister Reynolds. We're going to talk frequently, and I expect to have an Ambassador in Ireland pretty soon. And I'll make those decisions at what seems to me to be the appropriate time. I have not made them now, and I don't think it would be appropriate to make a final decision on that at this time. # Can we ask the Prime Minister if he likes the idea of a special envoy, opposes it, or would like to&mdash; Prime Minister Reynolds. I think we had a very long and fruitful discussion, both the President and myself. I gave him a fairly quick synopsis of the whole situation: the relationship between the two Governments that are excellent, between Dublin and London; the talks that took place last year; the progress that was made there; the suspension of the talks. And I think the objective of both of us, and indeed, the British Government included, would be to get those talks resumed at an earlier stage. We fully appreciate the keen interest and support of President Clinton in this regard and of his burning desire to have those talks recommenced. And he will keep in close consultation with all parties concerned so that we can get those talks resumed at the earliest possible date. # You don't think that a special envoy at this point would be helpful? Prime Minister Reynolds. As you have heard, the President just confirmed that both of those options are left open, and he will consult widely in the days and weeks and months ahead in relation to that. At the end of the day, it will be his decision. # Mr. President, have you taken on board the unionists' concerns about&mdash;in Northern Ireland&mdash;the suggestions that you might send somebody who would attempt to mediate the peace situation? President Clinton. Well, I don't think the United States can make peace in Northern Ireland, and I don't think that the unionists, the nationalists, anyone else would expect that. I think that we have a deep concern about the future of Ireland. We have a deep concern about ending the violence and the abuses of humanity which have been there. And I want to do whatever I can to support that process. I do believe, I'll say again, I do believe that the dialog that was opened not all that long ago between these two Governments in Ireland and Great Britain offer the real chance of producing a framework within which peace could occur. And I am going to continue to stay on top of the situation, involved in it. I'll make those decisions at a later time when I think they are appropriate. I think it is inappropriate now for me to do more than just to say that I think the Governments should in earnest embrace the opportunities that are before them. And I will be as supportive as I can. And whenever there seems to be something else I eau do by taking further action, then I will do it. I don't want to do anything to undermine the peace process. I want to do something that will support it and reinforce it. Secretary of Defense Les Aspin # Mr. President, what about Secretary Aspin's health? Do you have to now consider, at least consider, baring a new Secretary of Defense? No, people get pacemakers all the time. No. As far as I know he's just doing fine. Northern Ireland # Mr. President, do you still support the McBride principles which you said in your meeting with Irish leaders in New York&mdash;Yes, I do.What did you say about Ray Flynn? Mayor Raymond Flynn of Boston # Aren't you concerned the country may be losing one of its better mayors?Yes, I am. Press Secretary Myers. Thank you. It was a difficult decision for that reason. I think he's one of the best mayors to serve in the United States in my lifetime. # Why did you offer him the job? Because I need him and because I think he'll do a great job in a whole wide range of areas. And he was willing to serve, and I want him in the administration.Thank you.",clinton
"Last night I went to bed early&mdash;at 1:15 a.m.-for you, and I was taking odds on how many of you would actually be here this morning at 8:30 a.m. This may be a greater test of loyalty than the votes yesterday. I want to say to you, Mr. Speaker, a special word of thanks, and in his absence, to Mr. Gephardt, to whom I talked last night sometime after midnight. I want to thank you, David Bonior, for your work. And I want to say a special word of thanks for the southern-drawled discipline of Butler Derrick, the fine job he did. I love to listen to Butler talk. He makes me sound like a Yankee. I'd also like to thank the other leaders up here on the platform but especially the two chairs who are here, Mr. Natcher and Mr. Sabo, for the work they did. And I want to thank, of course, most of all, all of you for what you did yesterday. And I want to thank your constituents, the people who made this possible. If it hadn't been for the American people voting for a change in direction in this country, communicating that to you, and telling you that they would stay behind you if you made the tough decisions, none of this would have been possible. Yesterday was a great day of victory for ordinary Americans and for the proposition that this Government can work for them again, that we don't have to be mired in gridlock, that we don't have to spend all of our time posturing and dividing and running for cover instead of moving into the future. It was a wonderful beginning. I think it's important to remember that it's just a beginning, that you now have to encourage your colleagues on the other side of the Capitol to act and that we all have to continue to stay in touch with the people who sent us here. When I leave you today, I'm going to Atlanta to try to continue my dialog with the American people and to say we still have a great deal of work to do to create the jobs and invest in our people and reduce the deficit. But people know that it's working. You know, this last week I have had to take a good deal of time off to deal with the foreign policy responsibilities of the President. But one of the most interesting things that happened during the last week is that every world leader with whom I met at some point during the conversation said that America seems to be on the move again, that it's exciting to see so much happening here. I just want to say on behalf of all of you who were working last night, who missed the White House correspondents' dinner, I'll give you a list of my jokes on the way out&mdash; &mdash;but you won't have to endure them again. We are looking forward, the Vice President and I and all of our family, to working with you as we complete this work. This can be a historic year for this country. You acted with unbelievable dispatch. I don't think that a budget resolution has ever been passed so quickly and one has ever been this comprehensive and acted on this quickly. It is a wonderful beginning but is just the beginning. And let's, all of us, determine that we're not going to quit until our job is done. Let's urge the people, as I said, in the Senate to join hands with us and move forward quickly now. And let's stay in touch with the folks back home and tell them what we're really doing is giving the Government back to them. Thank you very much, and God bless you.",clinton
"Let me say, as all of you know, I received a letter not long ago from Justice White expressing his intention to resign from the Court at the end of this term and saying that be wanted to give me this much notice so that hopefully I could announce my intention to nominate someone and all the hearings could be concluded in time to really prepare someone to serve at the beginning of the October term of the Court. I called Justice White just a few moments ago and had a fine conversation with him. I've known him for nearly 20 years, and I thanked him for his service to our country. He's had a truly remarkable life. And I appreciate the fact that he cared enough about the Court as an institution to offer me a significant period of time to deliberate and still to have plenty of time to have a nominee considered by the Senate and then confirmed well in advance of the beginning of the Court's next term. So I will begin work on this tomorrow in earnest. and I will attempt to be faithful to my Constitutional duties and appoint a truly outstanding American in a timely fashion. Potential Supreme Court Nominees # [Inaudible]&mdash;you once mentioned Governor Cuomo before. I don't want to get into personalities now. This is Mr. Justice White's day. And as I said, I never will forget sitting in the Supreme Court as a young attorney general and having had him already tell me that the quality of representation by the States was pretty poor. And then I had worked very hard with a lawyer from my State who was making the argument, and he sent me a note, which I still have in my personal files 16 years later, saying that we were doing better. So that's what I'm going to try to do every day. # Do you have a long list of possible nominees? No. The list may get longer; it may get shorter. I did not anticipate having the opportunity to make an appointment at this early stage, so we don't have a big bank of potential nominees. I'll go to work on it tomorrow. I don't want to discuss any individuals at this point. I will do my best to pick a truly outstanding person just as soon as I can. Bosnia # [Inaudible]&mdash;is to get people out of Bosnia. Are you going to be able to comply with that request? President Mitterrand and I talked the other day, and he told me he was going to give some helicopters, which, as you know, he's done. And this morning was the first I have been informed of that. So we're going to discuss that today and make a decision. Abortion # Is abortion a litmus test for a Supreme Court nominee? Is that the whole issue? Now, the question as you ask it contains a thousand questions. And I wouldn't say no, and a thousand questions no. Do I believe that there is a constitutional right to privacy? Yes, I do.Thank you.",clinton
"I want to say good afternoon to members of the press. We have just finished a very lively discussion about the massive task before us in health care. Vice President Gore and I made a strong commitment to the American people during the last election that we would present to the United States Congress, within 100 days, a plan that would take strong action to control health care costs in America and to begin to provide for the health care needs of all Americans. As I traveled across the country last year, no stories moved me more than the health care stories. As I think all of you know, many of the people in our Faces of Hope luncheon last week during the Inaugural were people who were struggling to overcome incredible adversity occasioned by their health care problems. We've met elderly people choosing every week between medicine and food; we've met people forced to leave their jobs to get on public assistance to deal with children with terrific problems; we've met countless people who can't change their jobs because they or someone in their family have had health care problems. You will all remember, at the economic conference that we sponsored in Little Rock, perhaps the overwhelming concern of the business people there, of all sizes, was doing something about the cost and the availability of health care. When the Vice President and I met with the big three auto makers and the president of the United Auto Workers, once again they said, if you want to do something to help rebuild the auto industry, do something to control health care costs. And as Mr. Panetta just said again in a rather plaintive way before you came in, there is no way we will ever get control of the Federal budget deficit unless we do something about health care. The message is pretty simple. It's time to make sense of America's health care system. It's time to bring costs under control and to make our families and businesses secure. It's time to make good on the American promise that too many people have talked about for too long, while we have continued to spend more than 30 percent more of our income on health care than any other nation in the world, get less for it, and see 100,000 Americans a month losing their health insurance. As a first step in responding to the demands of literally millions of Americans, today I am announcing the formation of the President's Task Force on National Health Reform. Although the issue is complex, the task force's mission is simple: Build on the work of the campaign and the transition, listen to all parties, and prepare health care reform legislation to be submitted to Congress within 100 days of our taking office. This task force will be chaired by the First Lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and will include the Secretaries of Health and Human Services, Treasury, Defense, Veterans Affairs, Commerce, Labor, as well as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and senior White House staff members. I am grateful that Hillary has agreed to chair this task force and not only because it means she'll be sharing some of the heat I expect to generate. As many of you know, while I was Governor of my State, Hillary chaired the Arkansas Education Standards Committee, which created public school accreditation standards that have since become a model for national reform. She served as my designee on the Southern Regional Task Force on Infant Mortality, was also chair of our State's rural health committee in 1979 and 1980, a time in which we initiated a number of health care reforms that benefit the people of my State to the present day. And on the board of the Arkansas Children's Hospital, she helped to establish our State's first neonatal unit. I think that in the coming months the American people will learn, as the people of our State did, that we have a First Lady of many talents, who most of all can bring people together around complex and difficult issues to hammer out consensus and get things done. Here in The White House, Hillary will work with my Domestic Policy Adviser, Carol Rasco; my Senior Policy Adviser, Ira Magaziner; and the head of our health care transition team, Judy Feder. I've asked all of them to be as inclusive as possible. And as a part of that, we are inviting the American public to write us here at the White House with their suggestions. All of them should be sent to the Task Force on National Health Care Reform at the White House in Washington, DC 20500. We will no doubt be criticized by some for undertaking something very, very ambitious. But as I said in my Inaugural Address, we're going to have to make some tough choices in order to control health care costs, to bring them down within inflation, and to provide health care for all. In order to preserve the vitality of the American private sector, in order to keep the American people's budget here at this national level from going totally bankrupt, we are going to have to make some tough choices. Powerful lobbies and special interests may seek to derail our efforts, and we may make some people angry. But we are determined to come up with the best possible solution. And in my lifetime, at least, there has never been so much consensus that something has to be done. We have a plan from the American Nurses Association, from the American Academy of Physicians, from the American Academy of Family Practice, from the health insurance industry itself. We have a plan uniting business and labor. There is an overwhelming knowledge that we have to move and move now. We are going to do our best to reform our system. We are going to do our best to meet the human needs of the people of this country. There are all kinds of problems that have to be dealt with that we haven't even discussed yet: access to care in inner cities and rural areas, coverage for little children, dealing with the AIDS crisis adequately, still unmet needs in the area of women's health care, the problem of the veterans in this country who don't have access to care, even as their own network goes broke. All these issues will be dealt with in this task force. This is going to be an unprecedented effort. And let me just say, in general, we're going to set up a workroom, kind of like the war room we had in the campaign, over in the Executive Office Building. And all of the departments you see here represented and leaders you see represented around this table will be represented in that room. And we are going to work constantly, day and night, until we have a health care plan ready to submit to the Congress that we believe we can pass. Finally, let me say I am committed to doing this in a partnership with the Congress. I will ask the leadership of the Congress to work with me on a bipartisan basis and to do whatever we can to make sure that as we present the plan, we have also maximized its chances of early passage in the Congress. I thank all these people for their willingness to serve and to work together. I hope the American people will see just how passionately I personally am committed to doing something about health care reform. We've talked about it long enough. The time has come to act, and I have chosen the course that I think is most likely to lead to action that will improve the lives of millions of Americans. # Mr. President, can you provide universal coverage without driving up the deficit? I think you can do it if you control the cost of health care. You have to really&mdash;let me just&mdash;I don't want to get into one of these things that provoke a lot of cartoons about my policy work weakness, but we're at 14 percent of our income on health care now. The next most expensive health care system in the world is Canada's. It's at about 9.2 percent of income. That is a huge difference, massive. And yet, every other major country with which we compete provides some basic health care to everybody, something we don't do. So the answer to your question is, in my judgment, if we do this right over the next 8 years, you're going to see huge savings in tax dollars and even bigger savings, more than twice the savings, in private dollars that will free up hundreds of billions of dollars literally between now and the end of the decade to reinvest in economic growth and opportunity. In the short run, our tough call will be, how do you take the savings and phase in universal coverage, or should there be some other way to pay for that? We've got some short-term calls to make. But there's no question that in the medium term, 5 to 8 years, you're looking at massive savings with universal coverage, in both tax dollars and private sector dollars, if we do it right. # Mr. President, do you intend to pay the First Lady for her efforts? No. No. I never have paid her for her public service efforts. I don't want to start now. # Is 100 days hard and fast, or are you willing to be flexible on that if it's not quite If it were 101 days I wouldn't have a heart attack, but I don't want to&mdash;I want it done now. I think we know what the major alternatives are. What we have to do now is something nobody's done, and that is to meld them into the best possible legislation, taking account of some of the problems that exist with every course. And let me make one acknowledgment on the front end about this. Legitimate objections can be raised to any course of action in this area. That is, there is no such thing as a perfect solution. So whatever course we choose to take, somebody can say, Well, it's not perfect for these reasons. To that, I have two answers, and I'm going to say this until I'm blue in the face for this entire year until we get action. Number one, the worst thing we can do is keep on doing what we're doing now, because more and more people are falling out of the system and the cost is becoming more and more burdensome to those who are still bearing it. So whatever course we take, we will preserve what is best about American health care, some consumer choice and the quality of care. So whatever problems we have, they won't be as bad as the ones we've got now. Number two, this is not going to be the end of the line. Whatever problems are there can be fixed later. But we will never, never get anywhere if we stand paralyzed, because there's no such thing as a perfect alternative. # What factors did you consider in giving this high-profile position to Mrs. Clinton? Of all the people I've ever worked with in my life, she's better at organizing and leading people from a complex beginning to a certain end than anybody I've ever worked with in my life. And that's what I want done here.",clinton
"This is Janie Hatton from Milwaukee, and she is the School Principal of the Year. You can tell she's from Wisconsin because Senator Kohl is here, but I have to tell you she also grew up in my hometown of Hot Springs, Arkansas. We grew up in the same town. She's younger than I am.

And Tech is an important&mdash; I think it's going to fit, don't you? That's great. Mrs. Hatton. Thank you so much, Mr. President.I'm proud of you. Mrs. Hatton. And I'm proud of you. Great things happen to great people.Thank you. Meetings With Members of Congress # Mr. President, are you building incentives to help the economy and working with Congress? Are you getting momentum having all these meetings with the Hill, with Chairman Greenspan? Well, I think so. You know, we've got a lot more meetings ahead. I'm going to have a huge number of meetings, I hope, next week with Members. I needed this first week just to kind of get our feet on the ground here and get organized and get ready. But I have held a lot of meetings with Congress, and I'll do many more next week. I'll do as many as I can leading up to the February 17 address to the joint session. And after that I'll do as many more as I can. Homosexuals in the Military # Mr. President, are you confident that you'll ever get the ban on gays in the military lifted? Well, we're working on the resolution in the Senate, as you know. And I've been working mostly on economic issues today, so I just heard from my staff. But they seem to think we're pretty close to&mdash; # Are you satisfied with 6 months down the road? I'm satisfied with what I hope the resolution will be. You'll have to come back to me when there's final language there. I think the Joint Chiefs should have 6 months to deal with the practical issues involved. This is not free of difficulty. There are certain factual problems involved. But the principle&mdash;let me answer the question Mark [Mark Halperin, ABC News] asked me this morning about the principle. The principle behind this for me is that Americans who are willing to conform to the requirements of conduct within the military services, in my judgment, should be able to serve in the military and that people should be disqualified from serving in the military based on something they do, not based on who they are. That is the elemental principle. There is actually an enormous amount of agreement on this. The Joint Chiefs agree, for example, that we should not anymore ask people about their sexual orientation when they enlist. And I believe that any sort of improper conduct should result in severance. The narrow issue on which there is disagreement is whether people should be able to say that they're homosexual&mdash;and do nothing else&mdash;without being severed. But there are a whole lot of very complicated practical questions that flow from that very narrow issue. And that's what I want to have 6 months to give them a chance to work on. So, I hope we can.",clinton
"Thank you very much, Al. And hello, ladies and gentlemen. I want to thank you for agreeing to join us on this telephone call today and through this telephone call to speak to the people in your own State and throughout the United States. One of the things that we are determined to do here in Washington is open the Government to you and never let people forget, who are here making decisions, that you and lives are at stake and that these matters that we discuss and vote upon here really do affect real people out in our country. So with that, let me just now go from one person to the next and let each of you say something about how this family and medical leave act might affect your life in the future or could have affected your life in the past or the fact that we didn't have it affected you. [At this point, the President took a series of telephone calls from people who described their personal experiences.] Ladies and gentlemen, I know I speak for Vice President Gore when I thank all of you for your courage and your support on behalf of your own children and your own families and working families all across this country. We believe that next week, the Congress and the leaders who have worked on this in both parties will help our Nation join the 72 other countries who already have family and medical leave. And if it happens, it will be because of people like you and for people like you. I think a lot of you said this, but I just want to close with this: It's easy for people to talk about family values, but it's also important for us to value families. And your Government is going to be given a chance to value the American family next week. We hope and pray they'll do it. And if it does happen, you all can claim a lot of the credit. Thank you so much for being with us today, and have a wonderful time. And keep those kids making that good noise. I like to hear it. Bless you all. Goodbye.",clinton
"Thank you very much, Senator Ford, Mr. Speaker, Majority Leader Gephardt, Senator Mitchell, Senator Dole, Representative Michel. I'd like to begin by saying I didn't get much sleep last night, and if I get through this it will be tour de force. Al Gore and I stayed up a long time talking last night about this day and this country and what we hoped that we could do. I want to say first how very grateful I am to the Congress for the exertions here to make this Inaugural Day such a meaningful and wonderful one. I would like to especially thank Senator Ford who worked so hard to make sure everything went off without a hitch. And he did. I also thank you for the wonderful gift of crystal, the letter opener, which I will treasure always, that proved that we did get enough electoral votes to be here today. And Mr. Speaker, I'm delighted to have that key. However, with all respect, I can't believe you were fully briefed about my proclivities in lobbying legislators to let me come up here without an invitation. I may be here all the time. Why, just when you said you wished me well in untangling my relationships with Congress, my head, almost as if by magic, tilted in Senator Dole's direction. I make two serious points. Once in a generation we really are called upon to redefine the public interests and the common ground. I honestly do believe much of what we have to do today is work that knows no necessary partisan label and does not fall easily within the conventional divisions of liberal and conservative or Republican and Democrat. The second point I wish to make is that I cannot succeed as President unless Congress itself succeeds and the American people like the Congress again, too. For I seek to do, and to do we have to work together and move forward together. So I would like, in gratitude and respect, to propose a toast to a new partnership in America's Government.",clinton
"Thank you very much. Thank you, Congressman Stokes, Senator Metzenbaum. I want to thank Lou Stokes and Howard Metzenbaum for the support that they have given to this administration to making a new beginning for America, to putting the American people back to work, and to giving Washington back to you. I also want to say a special word of thanks to my friend Eric Fingerhut for coming here, the leader of the freshmen in Congress and a great Representative, someone who believes in the cause of reform. I want to thank your fine Mayor, Mike White, who labored mightily to try to get some more money for jobs here in Cleveland.I wish people all over America who think that our cities aren't working would come to Cleveland and see houses being built, the stadium going up, new malls being built, and things happening. I think it is very, very impressive what is happening here under the leadership of Mike White. And I appreciate him very much. I also want to thank Congressman Hoke for coming here. I'm glad to see a bipartisan Representative. I'm trying to govern in a bipartisan way, and some of those fellows in the Senate don't want me to. But if we get together on America's problems as America, we'd do a lot better than pointing partisan fingers. Finally, I want to thank attorney general Lee Fisher and your State treasurer, Mary Ellen Withrow. And I want to say a special word of thanks to Lee for his leadership in our campaign last year. I haven't been to Cleveland since the day before the election&mdash;that's right, that's what Lou said. I have been to Ohio once since I've been President. I look forward to coming back. I want to talk to you a little today about why I came to the middle of the country in the middle of the day to reiterate what is at stake in Washington. I just walked through the Galleria here. I want to thank the people who opened it up to me and Mr. Cleary and Mr. Masters. I want to thank all the store owners who came out to see me. Some of them gave me some things and some of them sold me some things, which is, after all, the most important thing. They did a good job. I wanted to come back here to remind you that the reason I did all that work last year and came here and asked the people of Ohio and Cleveland to vote for me was not so I could live in the White House but so I could give the Government back to you. The struggles in which we are engaged now are very important ones. It may seem strange to you, but there are really people in Washington who believe the most important thing we can do is to avoid change at all costs. It may seem strange to you after years of living with a Government where the debt of this country went from $1 trillion to $4 trillion between 1980 and 1992, where unemployment went up and wages went down and we began to lose our competitive position, where we cut defense but had no plan to put our defense workers to work building the domestic economy, with all the troubles we've got, where we've got 37 million Americans with no health insurance and others in small businesses terrified they're going to lose it and people who can't change jobs because they've had somebody in their family sick and they know they can't get health insurance in a new place, it may seem strange to you, but there really are people in the Nation's Capital who say no more change. Well, I think most of you want us to do something, and I think you want us to be bold. I think you want us to try to turn this country around, and I think you would rather see us err on the side of effort than on the side of just preserving the status quo. You look at these children here, these schoolchildren, or those fine schoolchildren back there or these young naval cadets. This whole deal is about whether they are going to have the American dream, about whether people who work hard and play by the rules are going to wind up better off or worse off. We've got a lot of complicated problems. I knew when I got there it wasn't going to happen overnight. I tried to make it happen overnight. I've been criticized for doing more than one thing at once. I've always felt&mdash;can you do one thing at once? Wouldn't it be nice if all you had to do was go to work and not take care of your family? Wouldn't it be nice if you could pay your bills and not earn any money to pay them? I don't understand this whole&mdash;you can't do one thing at once. But anyway, that's what they say. We are trying to do a lot of things, but they all relate to restoring the economic vitality of this country and restoring the middle class and the values of the middle class to a central part in American life. That is what this whole economic program is about and what I came to talk to you about again today. No one said it would be easy, but it has been immensely rewarding. In about 110 days, after two vetoes, I can look back and say we signed the Family and Medical Leave Act to guarantee you don't lose your job if you've got somebody sick in your family. We have put forward comprehensive plans to use technology to generate new jobs, comprehensive plans to help move people from defense jobs into domestic jobs and to make sure that our young people who come out of the service after serving this country are not just left out in the cold because of the cutbacks. And we got a record approval of the outline of a budget that cuts the deficit of this country over $500 billion in the next 5 years with over 200 specific budget cuts and, yes, with some tax increases. Seventy percent of them fall on the upper 5 percent of the American people whose taxes went down and whose incomes went up in the 1980's. I think it's a good plan, and it will restore health to the American economy. You know, we're trying to do something no generation of Americans has ever had to do. I came into office with a record debt. And then after the election I was told the deficit was really about $50 billion higher in 3 of the next 4 years than we'd been told before. And yet, we looked around, and we saw we'd reduced our investment in education and training, reduced our investment in new technologies, had no plan to deal with people who lose their jobs because of defense cutbacks. And so we had to do something nobody had ever done. We had to try to find out how to bring the debt down and invest in our people, their jobs, and their future. I think we have got to do that. If we don't do both, we're going to be in big trouble. Now look at the result. Since the election, since it became absolutely clear that this administration was dead serious about bringing this deficit down. Interest rates in many areas have hit an all-time low, home mortgages are at a 20-year low. I know there are people in this audience who have refinanced a home mortgage in the last 5 months. I know there are people here who have lower credit card rates, lower business loan rates, lower other rates because of interest rates going down. That's going to put $100 billion back into this economy to spur investment and growth and jobs and income if we bring the deficit down. Now, we're going to go into a fight where everybody's going to say cut more spending and raise fewer taxes. And you know, what that really says is cut somebody else's spending and raise somebody else's taxes. I wish it were possible for us all to hide behind a tree and point at somebody else. But let's face it, in the last 12 years we got into this mess not overnight and we're not going to get out of it overnight. We also, whether we like it or not, got into it together. We're all in it together, and we'd better get out of it together. We're going to have to climb out of it together, march out of it together, and walk out of it together. But this plan is fair. This plan has a big increase in the earned-income tax credit to try to relieve families with income of under $30,000 of the burden of the energy tax I proposed, which will raise money and help to clean up the environment. This plan has an increase in this earned-income tax credit so much that if you work 40 hours a week and you've got a child in the home, if you will apply for the tax credit, you will be lifted out of poverty. That is an elemental principle and a fundamental departure in America. We're going to reward work and not welfare for a change. If you work and you've got kids, we're going to lift you out of poverty. This will work. It will bring the deficit down. It will be fairer to working families. It will help us to keep interest rates down. It will help us to grow the economy. And over the next 5 years, we'll have some money to invest in education and training and new technologies and jobs and trying to help all those people in those high-tech jobs that are losing them, because of defense cutbacks&mdash;they can make us strong here at home if we do it fight. But we've got to do it as a package. If everybody goes around saying, What's in it for me? instead of what's in it for us, the thing will come apart. That's what paralyzes America. Every time we've got to make a tough decision, somebody says, Let somebody else do it. There's nobody else to do it but us. We're going to have to lift our country up, and we're going to have to do it together. One of the things that I do want to do is to repeal the tax breaks that lobbyists get. There are 80,000 lobbyists in Washington making sure that I can't take care of your interests. One of the things that we also have to do, I think, is to reform the political system. I told you if you would elect me President, I'd do my best to reduce the influence of lobbyists and special interest groups to increase your influence, to make it possible for all of the Members of Congress, without regard to party, at least to feel freer to follow their conscience and their constituents and to listen to them with an open ear and an open heart. Well, there are two bills moving through the Congress now that will do just that. When I took office the first thing I did was to sign an Executive order saying that people that had top jobs for me couldn't go back into lobbying for 5 years and could never lobby for a foreign government. Then a bill was introduced into the Congress that just passed the United States Senate which, for the first time, requires all the lobbyists to register and requires them to report all the gifts they give to Members of Congress over a small amount, so you'll know. And at the end of last week we announced a new campaign finance reform bill, which will do this: It will reduce the influence of big money; it will reduce the influence of political action committees; it will reduce the influence of lobbyists; it will give political campaigns back to you. It does it by limiting the amount of money that Members of Congress can take from political action committees by reducing the maximum contribution in many areas. It does it by saying that lobbyists cannot give money or raise money for Members of Congress that they personally lobby. And by repealing the tax exemption that lobbyists get, we're going to take that money and give it to Members of Congress as communication vouchers so we can open the airwaves to honest debate, and nobody is denied the opportunity to be on the television or the radio just because they're not an incumbent or just because they're not wired to the lobbyists. It is a good plan. It will give the Government back to you, the middle class of this country, and we ought to pass it. There are some other things that I think you need to know about that we're trying to do. We've introduced our plans for national service and to make college available to all Americans, and here's how it works. But I need your help to pass it, because there are interest groups that are against it. There are interest groups against everything. This plan would say to every American family: You can borrow the money to go to college without fear of going bankrupt because you will not have to pay it back until you go to work. And when you go to work, you can pay it back as a percentage of your income. So that no matter how much you borrow, you can't be required to pay more than a certain percentage of your income; you can't be bankrupted to secure your future. The bill also will give tens of thousands of young Americans the opportunity to pay their college loan, or a portion of it, off through service to our country as teachers, as police officers, working with kids in trouble. They can earn it before they go to college, while they're in college, or after they get out. But I think people ought to be able to work to make Cleveland and Ohio a better place and pay their college loans off. And believe it or not, if we just have the courage to change the way we're financing the college loan program, we can pay for most of this, particularly in the early years. Why? Because the way the college loan programs work now, we are losing billions of dollars a year in huge transaction fees to banks and in loan defaults, because the Government guarantees 90 percent of every one of these loans. So what happens? If somebody wants to default on the loan, what incentive does the bank have to go collect it? It would cost you 10 percent to pay the lawyer. So the taxpayers pay. I say let's make the loans direct. Let's cut out all the fat fees. Let's make people pay them back at tax time so they can't beat the bill, more responsibility and more opportunity for everybody. Let me just make two other points. First of all, while I have proposed over 200 specific budget cuts to take the lead in reducing this deficit by over $500 billion, I want you to know that nothing we can do will reduce this deficit over the long run to zero, which is what we want, until we finally face the fact that the biggest culprit in Government spending today is the exploding cost of health care. If we don't have the courage to try to provide a basic system of health coverage to all Americans, to try to give security to small businesses and working families who have health insurance but are terrified that they're going to lose it&mdash;if we don't do that, then you will never get this deficit down to zero because the cost of Government health care is going up by 12 percent a year. And 100,000 Americans a month are losing their health insurance. Now there is no easy answer to this. If it were easy, somebody else would have done it already. It's hard. Why? Because we're spending too much money on health care, but it's in all the wrong places. And the question is: How are you going to move the money from where it shouldn't be, in administrative costs and extra procedures and duplicated technologies and a lot of other things, to where it should be, covering people who don't have health insurance without bankrupting small business, without imposing undue Financial burdens, without imposing new taxes on people that are already paying too much. Can it be done? You bet it can, but it won't be easy, and it will require people who have been making a killing out of the present system to accept some change. But I'm telling you, the worst thing we can do is to do nothing. When we come out with this plan everybody will say&mdash;well, whatever we say to get the money to people who don't have health insurance now or to provide health security to those who can't change jobs now, they'll call that a tax. But when we lower by millions and millions and millions of dollars a year the health insurance premiums of people who are paying too much or the paperwork burdens of the doctors and hospitals who are spending too much money filling out paper, they don't want to count that-the defenders of the status quotas an offset. We are going to have to change, folks, but most of what we have to do is to move the money from where it shouldn't be to where it should. We're already spending plenty of money, but we've got to move it around. And you ought to be able to see that not only will it cost some people some more money to have health insurance, but a lot of people who are paying too much will save. And that is what we have to do. If we don't have the courage to change, we will not get the Government budget under control. But most important, working-class families in this country and small business people will never have the health security without which it is virtually impossible to have a good life over the long run. We have got to do this. And I am determined to see that we do. Let me just close by saying this: This is a difficult time. I told somebody the other day that I was absolutely convinced after 100 days as President that all the easy decisions had already been made by somebody else. Every day I meet with my staff and I say, send me just one easy one. Let's declare a moratorium. We won't talk about anything hard today. Send me an easy one. I'm still waiting. But I want you to know that we can turn this country around; we can secure our future. It is in our power. We can bring the deficit down. We can increase our investment in education and jobs. We can meet the competitive challenges ahead of us. We can face the health care challenge. But we have got to have the courage to change. And we will win if we do that. I wish to goodness I could just say to every one of you, you don't have to do any of this. I'll just go to some other State and make them do it. But I can't. Everybody will always be able to find some fault with every comprehensive proposal like this. There's no such thing as a perfect proposal. I don't like everything about everything that we have presented in the hope of passing and securing change. But the test for this generation, the test for this whole generation is whether we are going to have the courage to make these changes, to rebuild the middle class, and to lift up the economy of this country and to lift up all these children in this audience today. I believe you have that courage, and together we're going to do it.Thank you, and God bless you all.",clinton
"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thirty-nine years ago the great grandson of a slave became the first African-American to serve on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. In 1961, amidst fierce opposition, President John F. Kennedy appointed Thurgood Marshall as only the second African-American to fill a vacancy on the U.S. Court of Appeals. In doing so, President Kennedy not only ensured that the people of the Second Circuit would be served by an excellent jurist; he also took a big step forward in America's ongoing efforts for equal opportunity in every aspect of our life, including our courts. Judge Marshall went on to become one of our Nation's most distinguished jurists, highlighted by his 1967 appointment by President Johnson as the first African-American Justice of the United States Supreme Court. President Kennedy's action was in the grand tradition of Presidents of both parties, dating all the way back to George Washington, who have used their constitutional authority to bring much-needed balance and excellence to our Nation's courts. Four of the first five African-Americans to ascend to the appellate bench were initially appointed in the same fashion that I employ today. To fill a similar gap in our judicial system, I am honored today to announce my appointment of Roger Gregory, one of Richmond's most respected trial lawyers, to fill an emergency vacancy on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. I will renominate him when Congress returns in January, and I urge the Senate to confirm him. I take this extraordinary step for extraordinary reasons. First, the people of the fourth circuit are not receiving the judicial representation they deserve. The U.S. Judicial Conference has declared this seat a judicial emergency. It has been vacant for more than a decade. In the last 5 years alone, fourth circuit caseloads have increased more than 15 percent; yet one-third of its judgeships are vacant. This has left too many citizens waiting in line for justice. It is a travesty in a nation that prides itself in the fair and expeditious rule of law. Second, it is unconscionable that the fourth circuit, with the largest African-American population of any circuit in our Nation, has never had an African-American appellate judge. As I said when I first nominated Roger Gregory, it is long past time to right that wrong. Justice may be blind, but we all know that diversity in the courts, as in all aspects of society, sharpens our vision and makes us a stronger nation. Time and again, for 5 years now, I have tried and tried to fill these gaps in justice and equality. And time and again, for 5 years now, the Senate majority has stood in the way. Third, and perhaps most important, Roger Gregory is the right man at the right time to fulfill this historic role. His life is a testament to the power and promise of the American dream. The son of factory workers, he's the first in his family to graduate from high school, let alone college and law school. He graduated summa cum laude from Virginia State University and went on to earn his law degree from the University of Michigan Law School. He returned to teach at Virginia State, where his mother had once worked as a dormitory maid. He is now one of Virginia's leading litigators and one of its most civic-minded citizens. He's earned high praise from all quarters, including the American Bar Association, religious leaders, and both of Virginia's Senators, Republican Senator John Warner and Democratic Senator Chuck Robb. I want especially to thank Senator Robb for all he has done to make this day possible, for his tireless leadership in the Senate on this and so many other issues. He worked very hard to get back here today, but the bad weather down in Texas made it impossible. But I do want to thank him. He convinced me, and when I looked into the record I saw that it was absolutely true, that Roger Gregory would make an excellent judge for all the people of the fourth circuit. In closing, let me say I have not come to this decision lightly. I have always respected the Senate's role in the appointment process. Indeed, I have made far fewer recess appointments than President Reagan did in his 8 years, and I believe that the record on that is perfectly clear. On the other hand, I am compelled by the facts and history to do what I can to remedy an injustice that for too long has plagued the fourth circuit, and that I have tried for too long to remedy in the established way. As President, it is my constitutional responsibility to see that justice for all is not just what we promise; it's what we practice. That is the principle behind my appointment of this distinguished American today. Mr. Gregory, congratulations. [At this point, Judge Gregory made brief remarks.] Thank you. I'll answer your questions&mdash;I can't resist injecting just a little bit of levity here. One of the things you want in a judge is someone who is well-organized and has a good sense of timing. His children are 18, 12, and 6. I think that ought to be evidence in the hearing on his appointment. Middle East Peace Process # Mr. President, has the Mideast peace process been set back by the Palestinian reluctance to accept your proposals for an agreement with Israel? And do you have any indication of whether Thursday's summit is going to go forward? Well, let me say first, this is the first chance I've had to comment on the substance here, so&mdash;the parties are engaged in a renewed effort to reach an agreement. Based on the months and months of discussion I've had on these final status issues, we have attempted to narrow the range of outstanding matters in a way that meets the essential needs of both sides. The whole question now is whether they agree to continue the negotiation on the basis of these ideas. We've got to bring this to a conclusion if we're going to continue. The issues are extremely difficult, but they are closer than they have ever been before. And I hope and pray they will seize this opportunity. And I think that is all I should say at this time. The less I say, the better. # Is that right&mdash;you haven't heard from them? It sounds like you have not. The Palestinian officials have been saying they cannot accept your proposals. Well, we'll see what happens. Prime Minister Barak has said that he would accept and continue the negotiations if the Palestinians would, and we'll see what happens. There's a lot of things going on now, and will be in the next several days, and I think, as I said, the less I say about them all, the better. # Have you received a response, an actual response from the Palestinians yet? I've said all I'm going to say about this today. Shootings in Wakefield, Massachusetts # Mr. President, what were your first thoughts when you saw the news of the shootings up in Massachusetts? Excuse me? # The shootings in Massachusetts&mdash;I'm wondering what your first thoughts were and what you would say to the Nation in this holiday season with that happening. Well, I feel what I always feel when tragedy befalls Americans. And I hope that they will remember that this holiday season&mdash;interestingly enough in this season is not only the Christian season of Christmas, but the great Jewish and Muslim holy days happen to coincide in the same week this year. So I hope that we will remember, amidst our celebration, to pray for all the people involved. Appointment of Roger Gregory # Mr. President, do you think the issue of minority judgeships should be brought up in the Ashcroft confirmation hearings? And was this appointment in part aimed at highlighting that issue, and could, in fact, those hearings increase Mr. Gregory's chances of a confirmation? Well, I think I should answer the second question clearly. This is unrelated. I have tried for 5 years to put an African-American on the fourth circuit&mdash;for 5 years. Now&mdash; and for all the reasons that I made in my&mdash; stated in my remarks, I think it is most unfortunate that it has not been done, and I just determined to do it. It's just time to do it. On the other question, that is something that the Senate will have to deal with. I'll be&mdash;it's not my appointment, and I won't be President, and I don't think I should say any more about it. The Senate will do what it thinks is proper there. North Korea # The President of South Korea says he thinks it is unlikely you'll visit North Korea before January 20th. Have you moved any further toward a decision, whether to send an envoy there to see if North Korea is ready to reduce its missile program? We have been in touch with the North Koreans, and I may have some more to say about that. You know I just have a limited number of days here before I leave office, and I'm trying to get as much done as I can, including on that. I may have some more to say in the next few days about it. Pharmaceuticals Legislation # Mr. President, the reimportation-of-drugs law that you signed and which today you received the letter from Secretary Shalala&mdash;some folks are wondering why you would sign a law that contained such supposed flaws as were identified by the Secretary. Do you have any plan to negate, circumvent, or seek to counteract or overturn her ruling? Well, what she&mdash;I said when I signed the law that it was deeply flawed. She is required by law to make a determination that&mdash;two things&mdash;one, that the reimportation would not weaken the safety standards that we have for Americans and their pharmaceuticals. I think she could do that. But the second was, she had to make a determination by law that this would lower prices for American consumers. And the law was so different from the one we proposed and is so full of loopholes that she could not say in good conscience that she believed that the prices for consumers would go down, which is exactly what I warned when I asked them not to do this. So what we'd like to see is a law that protects safety, that will lower consumer prices. I do think that people ought to be able to do this, and&mdash;I did before, but I will again, as soon as the Congress comes back&mdash;I'll send them a statement of the things that I believe would meet the standard of the law. I think that Secretary Shalala did what she thought the law required her to do, and since she couldn't certify that American consumers wouldn't get lower prices, she didn't want to hold out false hope and be involved in something she thought was not legitimate. So I hope we can work this out. I do think there was in the last Congress, and I think there will be in this one, a majority for allowing Americans to reimport drugs under strict safety standards at lower prices. But I think we have to do it in a way where we don't promise something that doesn't materialize. That's all, really, that was at issue here. And I think&mdash;we'll send something up in the way of clarifying language as soon as they come back next week and see what we can do. Incoming Bush Administration # Mr. President, the Bush team has said that they're going through all of your Executive orders and your administration's regulations with a fine-tooth comb, and they may undo them. Are you concerned about this, and do you think that this recess appointment could go the way some of your Executive orders might? Well, they have very different views on the environment, particularly, and on some other issues. And when they take office, you have to expect them to do what they think is right. And you have to expect the people who disagree to disagree. And democracy will work its will, and then the citizens of the country will make their judgments. All I can do is to do what I think is right. And these things that we've been doing lately are things that we've been working on for years. For example, the&mdash;let me just use one example&mdash;the medical privacy regulations, which I think are profoundly important, we tried to do that through legislation, and the Congress&mdash;to be fair to the Congress&mdash;adopted a bill which said, okay, we've got to get this work done by a certain date, but if we can't get it done, then the administration can take action. So when it became obvious that because of all the conflicting interest groups that it wouldn't be possible for them to do that, when the date elapsed, passed, we decided that we would take action, as the Congress had explicitly authorized us to do. In terms of Secretary Browner's order regarding the trucks and the fuel, diesel fuel&mdash;which I think is a very, very important part of our clean air efforts, when asthma is the number one health problem among children in our country today&mdash;we've been working on that for years. That's not some sort of eleventh-hour thing. It's just that we didn't&mdash;this is when we finished, and so we did it. And I think we should just do what we think is right, and then when they get in, they'll do what they think is right. That's what democracy is all about. And they'll either&mdash;if they want to undo these things, then they'll either be able to do it or they won't, as the process plays itself out. That's the way the system works. And I have no problem with that. They have to do what they think is right, just like we do. Presidential Pardons # Mr. President, are you still considering providing pardons for some of the Whitewater figures? I expect to do another round of pardons, but I haven't had any meetings or made any decisions about any others yet. I just expect to do some. I have done&mdash;I haven't seen the final numbers, but before the last batch at least, I had done fewer than any President in almost 30 years. And part of that, frankly, is the way the system works, something I'm not entirely satisfied with. But I think that it is appropriate for the President to do them where circumstances are appropriate. I have always thought that Presidents and Governors, when I was a Governor, should be quite conservative on commutations&mdash;that is, there needs to be a very specific reason if you reduce someone's sentence or let them out&mdash; but more broadminded about pardons because, in so many States in America, pardons are necessary to restore people's rights of citizenship. Particularly if they committed relatively minor offenses, or if some years have elapsed and they've been good citizens and there's no reason to believe they won't be good citizens in the future, I think we ought to give them a chance, having paid the price, to be restored to full citizenship. And in that sense, I think that the word is almost misused, because it's not like you&mdash;you can't erase the fact that someone has been convicted and served his sentence, in the case of those who have. But there are many people, including more people than I get their applications to my desk&mdash;many people don't have lawyers; they don't even know to ask for a pardon&mdash; but they'd like to vote at election time; they'd like to be full citizens. And they're out there working hard and paying taxes, and they have paid the price. So I would like to be in a position to do that. A lot of the folks&mdash;virtually all of them on the first list I released, 58, I think, were people that are unknown to most Americans. They're not people with money or power or influence. And I wish I could do some more of them&mdash;I'm going to try. I'm trying to get it out of the system that exists, that existed before I got here, and I'm doing the best I can. Summation Speeches # You gave wrap-up foreign policy speeches in London and in Nebraska. Do you have any other speeches, summation speeches planned for other policy areas? I expect I'll do one on domestic policy; I'm trying. We're looking for a venue, and after the first of the year, I'll probably do at least one more. Thank you all very much. # What about Gray Davis? # Are you going to take reporters on your next househunting trip, Mr. President? I hope I don't have to do any more. Thank you.",clinton
"Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President, for that wonderful introduction and for being such a great partner in the campaign of 1992 and in this administration. I think it is fair to say that Vice President Gore has already exercised a larger role in this administration than perhaps any Vice President in the history of this country. And I hope he will continue to do so. I'm honored to be here with Ralph Neas and with my longtime friend Benjamin Hooks. Don't you just love to hear Ben talk? I mean, really, I could hear him intone those poems from now until tomorrow morning, reminding me of the rhythms of my childhood and the faith of our parents. I'm proud to be here with all of you tonight not only because of what you have done for the last four decades and more but because of what together we must do now. I'm proud of your commitment to civil rights. I'm proud to be here with our Attorney General, Janet Reno, who is the embodiment of that. I thank you for the vote of the national board of the leadership conference today to support the nomination of Lani Guinier to be Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. I want to say a special word of support for Lani Guinier. I went to law school with her, and I announced at the Justice Department the other day when we announced all of our Assistant Attorneys General that she had actually sued me once. Not only that, she didn't lose. And I nominated her anyway. So the Senate ought to be able to put up with a little controversy in the cause of civil rights and go on and confirm her so we can get about the business of America. I want to say, too, how honored I am to be here with your honorees. My friend Dorothy Height: From the freedom schools in Mississippi to the Black Family Reunion, what a guiding spirit she has been to all of us.I want to take my hat off to Raul Yzaguirre for his leading voice. Over 20 years ago, I first came in contact with La Raza as a movement and a commitment. And I have watched them over these years help people all across the country with the practical problems of life which give real meaning to the idea of civil rights, when you can actually live in a decent house and have a decent job and know your kids are going to get a decent education and know that you're going to be treated fairly no matter what your race is. I want to say, too, how very much I admire Justin Dart for all the work that he's done as Chair of the President's Commission on Employment of People with Disabilities and leader in making the Americans with Disabilities Act come to life. You know, Justin, every time we went anywhere in the campaign and had a rally, we always had a section for people with disabilities. Today I went to a suburb north of Chicago, in a heavily Republican community, as it turned out, to meet with a bunch of students from the high school that I was visiting and other high schools and people in the community. And we had a big section there for the students with disabilities. And I was thinking as I was coming over here tonight, a lot of those kids are where they are today because of what you did&mdash;and you ought to be proud of that&mdash;sitting in the front of the row so they can ask the President their questions and shake hands with the President; instead of being overlooked, being uplifted. I say that to you to make one introductory point. I've been here for 100 days and a sum, fighting to break the gridlock in Washington. And sometimes I think the biggest gridlock of all is the gridlock in our minds, the hold that foolish notions have on our imaginations. I have been roundly attacked by people on the extreme right trying to make me look like some radical left-winger because I had this crazy notion that I ought to have an administration that would have some diversity and give women as well as men and people of color as well as people who look like me the chance to serve if they could meet high standards of excellence. And there are people who say, well&mdash;and I see these relentless articles in the paper&mdash;oh, that's why no appointments are being made. Well, so in 100 days I show up at the Justice Department, and I ask for the totals: Pass me the envelope, please. And it turns out that in spite of my commitment to diversity and excellence, after 100 days my predecessor had made 99 appointments, his predecessor, President Reagan, had made 152 appointments, and I'd made 173. Where are they? And I expected to see the shameless right in sackcloth and ashes, saying that we had falsely accused this poor President in promoting gridlock. But they have no shame. Let me tell you something: Today when I was in Illinois, a young, handsome, fine-looking Hispanic man stood up and said, I have joined the United States Army. And I'm proud that I'm going to serve my country. And I know we've got to cut the military budget, but I want to know if you're going to cut it so much that I can't give my whole career to my country if I want to. And I thought to myself, why doesn't somebody point out to all these people who have attacked us for trying to open the doors of opportunities that the number one, most successful institution in the United States of America for giving opportunities to women and people of color are the United States military branches. They have done it with a commitment to excellence and opportunity. And what we've got to do is to prove that the rest of us can do so as well. And we ought not to make this a partisan issue, and the guardians of gridlock should stop trying to use it to move arguments around that indicate that there's somehow something wrong with the President who believes that everybody who can serve ought to have the chance to do so. This administration is committed to the enforcement of the civil rights laws. This administration is also committed to programs like national service that give everybody the possibility of being part of a new era of civic responsibility. This administration is committed to guaranteeing that every American is entitled to a fair chance at the brass ring but even more important, to empowering people to seize those opportunities, to moving beyond the incredible gridlock in the mind of this town that you either have to give somebody something for nothing or take it all off the table. Why don't we behave in Washington the way people behave in their normal lives? We need opportunity and responsibility. Why don't we stop making these nutty arguments that imply that everything in life is an either-or proposition: We're either going to write somebody a check and bust the Government budget, or we're just going to stick it to them and walk away. That's not the way life works. You know, civil rights should embody a country that works. We don't want to guarantee everybody equal employment opportunities when there are no jobs. Does that mean that we have to sacrifice one and not the other? No, it means you should have a President who will pursue both, walking and chewing gum at the same time. That's what this is about. Is that right? We want to guarantee everybody an equal opportunity to get an education, but wouldn't it be nice if the education you're getting is also better? It's not either-or. We want to guarantee everybody the right to health care and family security through health care, but wouldn't it be nice if you live in a rural area or in the heart of a big city if there happens to be a clinic to visit? I just am amazed after 100 days to find that a lot of the gridlock that has gripped this city for so long is in the imposition of what one writer had called false choices on all of us who are supposed to make policy. It never occurred to me that I should appoint somebody who wasn't qualified to a job. You know, I don't wake up in the morning thinking, you know, I need to find some female Latino who is totally unqualified to put in a job. Or neither did it ever occur to me that every white man I appoint is going to hit a home run every day. But that is the kind of rhetoric you see running beneath so much of the characterization when we try to change 12 years of attitudes. The same people that were criticizing the previous administrations for being insensitive to civil rights immediately turned around and say, Oh, there's too much, too much attention being given to ethnicity and gender, and that's why no appointments are being made. So the record comes in, and I'm still waiting for the acknowledgement. I tell you, folks, I refuse to believe that we cannot go forward together, that we cannot set an example, that we cannot make progress. I refuse to believe that you can't be committed to civil rights and to civic responsibility. I refuse to believe that we can't create economic opportunity by empowering people to seize control of their destiny and changing the Government's policies. I think that if this leadership council should have any mission today, it should be to break through those barriers that push us all into one extreme camp or the other and make us mute in the face of reality and common sense. Surely we can bring the experience of our own lives and the lives of our fellow Americans beyond the borders of this city to the policy-making process that will dominate Washington for the next year. That is what we ought to do if we want civil rights to come alive in this country. You know, when I ran for this job I spent a lot of time in African-American churches because I always had, and because I felt at home. When I got this job and I sought to protect the religious and civil liberties of every American, it was because I wanted mine protected and because I have a sharp memory of what it was like to live in a society where half the people I knew, because of their color, were treated as second-class citizens. I also have a sharp memory of those who had the courage to try to change that position. And now that I am President, I want you to know that I'll make my mistakes from time to time, but I'm going to keep trying to move the ball forward. I believe we can make advances. I don't believe that our fights are over.I know that there are still civil rights battles to be fought, but I know that they need to be fought today in the context of making a real difference in real people's lives. And we should not be intimidated, those of us who believe in the cause of civil rights for all Americans, into thinking that somehow that can be separated from the fight for economic justice and economic progress and making our free enterprise system work better. We should not let people who basically don't care whether we make progress in civil rights think that you can separate civil rights from the fight for substantive improvements in education and for meaningful advances in health care or any other area of our national life. Let us resolve tonight that we're going to spend the next 4 years breaking down the gridlock by tearing down the artificial barriers in people's minds to bringing us together, saying we don't have a person to waste and lifting up everybody's God-given potential and doing what we can to see that they achieve it.Thank you very much, and God bless you.",clinton
"Please sit down, ladies and gentlemen. Good morning. It's great to see all of you here in the Rose Garden. I want to thank the Members of Congress who have joined us for this ceremony, and welcome all of you small business people and your families from all across America here to the White House for this important day. This is an extra special day to celebrate the winners of the small business people of the year awards, because today we're also going to have the oath of office for the new Administrator of the Small Business Administration, Erskine Bowles. I chose Erskine for a very simple reason, because he's a business person and not a politician. Too often in the past, the SBA has been the province of politics too much and business too little. This man has devoted his life to helping people start businesses, to helping them grow their businesses, to helping them reach out beyond the borders of their communities, to State and regional and national and international markets. He really understands what it's like to start and to keep going a business enterprise. His plans for the Agency include a plan to improve the management and outreach to determine what we can do to actually create more success stories in the small business community. He's already met, I know, with many of you who are here for this celebration. But that's just the beginning. I think you will see the most energetic, connected, and continuous effort to reach out to small business that the SBA has ever given to the American small business community. Now, I'd like to introduce Erskine and Judge James Dixon Phillips, Jr., of the Court of Appeals of the 4th Circuit in Durham, North Carolina, who will administer the oath of office. Erskine's wife, Grandall Bowles, will hold the Bible, and then they will take it over from there. Judge? [At this point, Judge Phillips administered the oath of office. Mr. Bowles then expressed his gratitude to the President and enumerated his priorities for SBA. ] Thank you very much. I predict that over the next 4 years, small business men and women in every State in America will come to see Erskine Bowles as the best advocate they ever had. And I assure you that he is going to have a real influence on our economic policy. Some evidence of that is the presence here today of the two other Members of my Cabinet, Ron Brown, the Secretary of Commerce, and Mickey Kantor, our U.S. Trade Representative. We are going to have a coordinated policy for small business. We have to have the Commerce Department, we have to have the Trade Office, we have to have the Treasury Department if we're going to attack all these issues. And I'm very, very proud of the team that we've got working on it. Let me just mention one or two other things about the small business economy. We have spent most of our time in the last 3 months or so in meetings in this White House talking about the economy and talking about health care and its impact on the economy. Over and over and over, we come back to a central fact of the American economy in the last 12 years. In every year of the last 12 years, the biggest companies in America have reduced employment in this country, even as they were increasing productivity, even as their profits went up, even as their stock values went through the roof and Wall Street reached all-time highs, in every year. Some of that is because of being involved in other countries in a global economy. A lot of it is just using the technology of new productivity to have machines do more work, or have people do more work, overtime, and more part-time workers. But the bottom line is, in every year employment has been reduced by the biggest businesses in this country. In every year until about 3 years ago, the reduction in employment by big business was more than offset by the increase in employment by small businesses in America and by the startup of new businesses. Then, about 3 years ago, that too came to a halt because of a national and international recession, because of the credit crunch, because of the burgeoning costs of health care on smaller businesses and all the extra additional costs of hiring one more worker, whether it's worker's comp or some other cost or the Social Security costs. The extra added costs to small business of hiring additional workers meant that, over the last 2 or 3 years, small businesses, even when they were growing, have relied more and more on overtime, more and more on temporary workers, and less on adding to the job base of America. We have talked about this endlessly in these walls here, trying to come up with policies that would address that, trying to reward the spirit, the grit, the entrepreneurialism, the creativity of you and millions of Americans like you all over this country. I have seen, I suppose, being a former Governor of a small State, as many small businesses up close as virtually anybody who ever occupied this office. I have more than a healthy respect for the fact that you now employ a majority of America's workers and create a huge majority of America's new jobs. Just a couple of days ago, as I'm sure you all know, I went out to Ohio and to Illinois. And when I finished my speech in downtown Cleveland to the City Club, before we went out to the airport, I told my entourage with no planning that I wanted to go back to a small business that I came across in the primary in Parma, which is a suburb of Cleveland, to visit a woman named Mary Poldruhi, who became a friend of mine in the election. She started a business called Parma's Pierogis. And she did it as a Polish American, and no bank would loan her any money. So she got a telephone book and called hundreds of people in the telephone book with Polish surnames until she found 80 people who agreed to put up $3,000 apiece to start her business, which she rims with her family and a couple of friends and which has done very, very well indeed. That is the sort of spirit and creativity that I'm sure&mdash;I see a lot of you nodding because you identify with that experience in your own lives. I was so impressed with this woman and her family that, literally, I was sitting there in Cleveland we just decided to go back and see her and see how the business was doing and what could be done to try to stabilize this environment and make it better. I want to talk about just two or three of the things we're trying to do. Erskine already mentioned the initiative that Secretary Bentsen organized to have the five major financial Departments of the Federal Government work on trying to simplify regulations and end the credit crunch. A lot of business people tell me that it takes a little time for the orders we issue in Washington to manifest themselves in the bank down the street. And if that's not happening, that is one of the things that Erskine Bowles is here to address. We are determined to change the environment which has led to so much withdrawing of capital when it ought to be out there plentiful now, given the economic conditions, for new loans for good prospects. Secondly, in the proposal that the Congress is now considering to bring the deficit down, there is a sweeping new proposal to provide a huge capital gains cuts for new investments and new enterprises to try to start more small businesses, and I hope it will have your support. We've also asked for an extension of the 25 percent deduction of health care costs for the self-employed, which I think is very important. Finally, we are in intense negotiations at this moment, as we speak, to guarantee that whatever comes out of the House Ways and Means Committee in the tax bill will include a substantial increase in incentives for small business people to reinvest in their own companies. So these are the kinds of things that I hope will help us to generate more jobs and will support your efforts. There is also a community development bank initiative and a big enterprise zone initiative that I think will help to spark more small businesses in distressed areas and rural communities and big cities. But over the long run, we also have to have a healthy financial climate in the country. And that means that we must pass a budget this year that takes a strong step to bring this deficit down. Ever since the election was over when the then-Secretary-designate of the Treasury, Lloyd Bentsen, went on television and said we are going to have a tough deficit reduction plan and outlined some of the elements of it, interest rates have been going down in this country. Mortgage rates are at 20-year lows. The business journals say that if we could keep interest rates down this low for another few months, over $100 billion will be released into this economy through refinancing of home mortgages and business loans and other things for new investment and new opportunities. Now, we know that someday interest rates will go up again, but we want it to happen when the economy starts to boom again. And we want the interest rates to stay down while we refinance and get as much new money as we can at low interest rates back into this economy. A year ago, only 47 percent of the American people thought, for example, that the next generation of Americans would be able to afford a new home. Just a couple of weeks ago a bipartisan poll said 74 percent of the people now think that, because we're making a strong effort to bring the deficit down to hold the interest rates down. I wish there were easy and painless ways to do that, but it requires cuts and tax increases. I'm going up to New York after I leave you today to announce at the Cooper Union that I am going to support, strongly, the proposition that we guarantee the American people two things: number one is, no tax increases without the spending cuts, and number two is, that tax increases will go to reduce the deficit, by creating a legally separate deficit reduction trust fund which will tell you where your money is going. I think that this will do as much as anything else we can do to make your lives healthier over the long run. Let me finally make one last point. We didn't get into our economic difficulties overnight nor at the hand of any particular party. There is enough blame to go around, and there will be enough credit to go around, if we work our way out of it. I want to reiterate what I have tried to say since the day I became President: I do not seek a Democratic or a Republican resolution of America's problems. I would like for us to define an American solution that goes beyond the paralyzing debates of the past. In spite of the fact that we've had a little of that here, there's also a lot of evidence that we are moving beyond it. We've passed a budget resolution in record time. The Congress passed the motor voter bill yesterday which had strong opposition, but it's a great thing, and the young people of this country are very excited because it will make it easier for them to vote. In the last election we had more young people voting than any time in 20 years, and there was a sense that we could give our political system back to the people who are the true owners of it. So I think there is every reason to hope that we can still build a sense of possibility and hope and progress among people of good faith in both parties, and I want to encourage that. And it ought to be rooted in ideas and in action, because that's really the sort of thing that brought all of you here today. I hardly ever have had what you would call a conventional political discussion with a small business person. You know, I mean, if I go in and I talk to somebody about, can you afford health care? What's your coverage? What are the options? What's the matter with the insurance coverage? How big is the pool you're in?-the words Democrat and Republican never come up. Somebody says they went down to the bank, and they couldn't get a loan, and here were the problems, and look at this stack of paper from the Small Business Administration I had to fill out. Nobody ever put a political context on it. And I hope that we can focus our attention here on our problems and ask openly what should be done about them in the same way that you and I would engage if we were just having a personal conversation in your place of business. The triumphs of the people we honor here today it seems to me, are the triumphs of America. The idea that you've got a right to take a chance. You've got a right to fail so that you have the right to succeed. You're given the opportunity in a free-market economy to bring your ideas to bear and see if people respond. I have been terribly impressed&mdash;I've read the life histories of a lot of the award winners that are here today, and not just the three that we come to recognize. And I wish I could say something about all of you who are represented. But as you know, the purpose of this ceremony is to recognize the second runner-up, the first runner-up, and the Small Business Person of the Year. I just want to say to all the rest of you, we honor your achievements, and we know that these people, in a fundamental and profound sense, are reflective of what all of you have done. For David Parker, success has been what you might call an open-and-shut case. His Pelican Products of Torrance, California, began as a scuba supply manufacturer but now is best known as a maker of suitcases and containers that are so hardy they're used in the environmental safety industry. They've even survived on a trip to Mr. Everest, something I'm not sure I could do. Now, that is a real climb to success. I want to ask David to come up here and receive our congratulations as a second runner-tip in the Small Business Person of the Year. Carol Rae was hired as a consultant to the Magnum Diamond Corporation. But in no time, she was asked to run the company. Now, I can tell you, as somebody who has fooled with a lot of consultants, that in itself is an incredible compliment. As president of the business, she's made it a leader in surgical tools for eye surgery. The Rapid City, South Dakota company has grown from 7 employees to 68 in about 4 years. That's a very impressive achievement for Carol Rae, our first runner-up. Would you please come forward and be recognized? Did you hear what she said? 'I'm one of his customers. Bill Engler, Jr., is the CEO of Kaytee Products, and that makes him the biggest employer in Chilton, Wisconsin. Kaytee is a case study of making change your friend and not your enemy. The business has been in his family since 1866 when it sold feed and grain, something I know a little about. But it wasn't until Bill took over 9 years ago that the business began a growth explosion. Kaytee now sells only wild bird and pet food, and it's gone from 64 employees to 365 workers. Sales went up from $10.6 million to more than $70 million. And for his amazing accomplishments, Bill Engler, Jr., has been chosen the Small Business Person of the Year. Let's bring him up with a hand. [At this point, the President presented Mr. Engler with the award.] I want to salute you all. I want to wish you continued success. I want to pledge you continued access to this administration. I want to ask you now as you leave here to give us the benefit of your ideas, your suggestions, your constructive criticisms and help us to bring to the White House the kind of entrepreneurial spirit that you have brought to your businesses and that we must all bring to the United States.Thank you very much.",clinton
"Thank you very much. It always seems to be a good thing for me when I'm introduced in New York by Governor Cuomo. I must confess to having mixed feelings as I sit on this revered stage with all these distinguished citizens. And President Iselin made his eloquent remarks and then your fine Mayor spoke so forcefully, and the brilliant chairman of the Senate Finance Committee brought us back to Woodrow Wilson. And then Governor Cuomo once again gave me a hard act to follow, and they all left the stage. I thought to myself, pray this is not a metaphor for the battle ahead. This is the second thing I have had in common with President Wilson. I received a fascinating letter the other day from Johnston and Murphy, the shoe manufacturers from Nashville, Tennessee. They have made shoes for every President going back to the 1850's, so they made a pair of shoes for President Lincoln. And they send you a little catalog, and you pick the shoes you want, and they send them to you with your name in them. It says Johnston and Murphy-every President served. And so I ordered these rather simple plain black shoes, and they wrote me this wonderful letter in which they said, We're from Nashville, Tennessee, and we know what's in your heart. So here's an extra pair of shoes. And they sent me a box of blue suede shoes. And then in the letter they recounted the choices of all the previous Presidents. And they said that in one way my choice was not particularly innovative, that five other Presidents had chosen the same style I did, including Harry Truman, which made me very proud. But they said, You do have the biggest feet of any President since Woodrow Wilson. So you had two sets of big feet here from the Presidents. President Wilson said in an address that Senator Moynihan quoted: I have been dealing with young men most of my life&mdash;he wasn't so gender-sensitive as he should have been-and one of the things I have tried most to impress upon them is not to stay young too long, but to take themselves seriously. Now at one level I want us all to stay young forever, but I do think the time has come for us to take ourselves and our purposes more seriously. This celebrated institution and the community of scholars and activists it embraces is the result, as President Iselin said, of Peter Cooper's determination more than 130 years ago to create an institution intellectually vigorous with free tuition, the first nondiscrimination policy in American history, and a genuine commitment to social justice. He believed you could do more than one thing at a time. Here Mr. Lincoln asked our country to confront the cost of the spread of slavery, to ask hard questions about the conditions that had plagued our Nation since its beginning. Remember it was Thomas Jefferson, not Abraham Lincoln&mdash;Thomas Jefferson the slave owner&mdash;who said, I tremble when I think of slavery to consider that God is just. There were people who knew in their hearts the truth but had denied it a long time. Lincoln said that to continue to do that threatened to tear our country apart. He knew the Nation would be destroyed if slavery spread and that unless the country's drifting stopped, the very drift would carry within it the seeds of our destruction. And so, here at Cooper Union he asked those hard questions and gave strong answers. Soon after, he won the nomination of the fledgling Republican Party and went on to win the Presidency by only 39 percent of the popular vote, receiving virtually no votes south of the Mason-Dixon line. Soon after that, the war came, and Lincoln's fight for the Union grew into a determination to abolish slavery. Several days a week I walk alone into the room in the White House where Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation and try to remember the purposes of the United States of America. The fight for the Union and the fight against slavery cost Abraham Lincoln his life, as well as the lives of hundreds of thousands of his fellow countrymen. But America prevailed in form and spirit. And America has endured in form and spirit because in times of crisis and challenge, leaders have asked the hard questions and given the strong answers. And the American people have rallied. Look at the condition of America today. How can we avoid asking those questions? To be sure, we are still the strongest Nation in the world politically, economically, and militarily. To be sure, more than anyone else in the world we have accommodated the incredible diversity of our land with remarkable harmony. When you look at what is happening, the heartbreak in the former Yugoslavia today, where there are three ethnic groups that genetically have no ethnic differences at all but call themselves ethnically different solely because of the accidents of religion and history, it is an incredible tribute that in this country, in this great city and across the country in Los Angeles and in all places in between, that we live together as well as we do with our diversity. But still we cannot avoid the hard questions. If we're so great, why are most middle class families working longer hours today than they were 20 years ago for wages that in real terms are less than they were a decade ago? Why are one in 10 of our people so impoverished they're on food stamps? Why are over 8 million of us out of work if we're in the 17th month of a recovery? Why are there over 35 million of us without health care and millions more Americans terrified of losing their health coverage, with 100,000 Americans a month losing their health insurance, and millions of others who can never change jobs under the current system because they or someone in their family has been sick and so they have a preexisting condition which makes them unemployable with health insurance elsewhere? Why? Why that half the people on welfare not get off of it as a safety net after just a few months? Why is there a whole class of new poor people, mostly young women and their little children, many of those children never born into an integrated family? Why? Why was&mdash;only 35 years ago, only 35 years ago&mdash;there conditions even in New York City in which there were three police officers on the street for every violent crime, and today there are three crimes for every police officer? Why does the Government fail to deal with the problems that this age has brought to us and engaged the American people in dealing with them? Why have we seen the Government's debt grow from $1 trillion to $4 trillion in the last 12 years, while we reduced our investment in the people of America and their promise and their ability to compete? Why in the world would we reduce all this defense spending, including jobs for engineers and scientists and factory workers, with no plan whatever to put that money back to work to create opportunities for them, cleaning up the environment or exploring the frontiers of technology here at home or helping us to compete with people all around the world? The American economy finds itself in the middle of a global marketplace, challenged on every hand by nations who have made wise investments in their people, their workers, and their technological edge. Yes, there is today a global recession which is making our problem more difficult. But if you take the long view, those who have made the investments in the eighties and those who are doing so now will be rewarded over the long run. For a decade or more, we have both expanded our debt and reduced our investment in areas key to our future. We also have in this country a crisis of belief and hope. When President Kennedy took office, younger than I was when I took office, over 70 percent of the American people fundamentally believed that their leaders would tell them the truth and that their system could succeed. Now it seems as if half the people just stand around waiting to be disappointed, waiting to be told what's wrong and who's failed and how the special interests once again have strangled the national interests and why they should go on about their business without believing things can be different. I believe that the nature of our challenge is this: We must both restore our economy and restore the confidence of our people in our democracy. And I do not believe we can do one without the other. This is a strange and, in a way, wondrous moment in our history when citizens everywhere desperately want things to change but still are wary of it and reluctant to place their faith in anyone's prescription. We must begin with the economy. We must change the way the Government works if we expect the economy to improve. And we must rebuild the confidence of the American people based on the three words which were the watch words of my campaign for President: more opportunity for all, more responsibility from all, and the clear understanding that we are a community and we're all in this together, going up or down together. Whether we like it or not, that is clearly the truth. And we must begin to act as if it were. How can we reduce the deficit? Let's start with the big problem of the debt. Well, the answer is not popular. To reduce the deficit you have to reverse what produced the deficit. What produced it? Tax cuts and spending increases. Doing what people like. The most popular thing in the world is for me to cut your tax and write you a check. And that was what was done by Government for the American people for 12 long years. I'll cut your tax and I'll write you a check&mdash;that's a good deal. It used to be known as a free lunch when I was a kid. We have to begin to reverse this process. And because Government has been at fault, first you should ask Government to change. So I have asked in Washington that we begin with significant spending cuts below the budget that was adopted last year to reduce the deficit and to free up resources for targeted investment in the future of our economy and of the young people here present in this hall. We should look at every program for possible savings, including ones that Democrats have favored for a long time. And there should be no tax increase, not a dollar, without the spending cuts. That is the meaning of the budget resolution that was passed a few weeks ago in record time. It contains the largest deficit reduction proposals in history, over $500 billion in deficit reduction over a 5-year period with more than 200 very specific cuts in programs. Those were tough to make, but necessary in the face of a $4 trillion debt that will continue to grow until the deficit itself is reduced to zero. That deficit is robbing us of our ability to invest in our future. More and more of our money just goes to pay interest on the debt. If we don't change it, by the end of the decade over 20 cents on every dollar you pay in taxes will go just to service the debt. Now, that is also a redistribution of wealth away from middle class taxpayers to the upper income people who hold the debt, instead of to invest in the jobs and the education and the infrastructure of the future of New York and the rest of America. We made cuts in Medicare, a thing that is difficult to do. We asked upper income Social Security recipients to pay tax on more of their incomes, a thing that is difficult to do. In spite of the fact that I value public service greatly and I believe public employees too often have been used as whipping boys for the difficulties and frustrations of the moment, still I asked the public employees of the United States of America to have a pay freeze for a year and to keep their wage increases below inflation and cost of living allowances for each of the next 3 years. I come from a rural State, heavily electrified by the Rural Electrification Agency, but I asked that the subsidies to the REA be reduced. I asked that certain programs that benefit cities but that don't have the accountability of the normal budgeting process also be reduced. All these were not easy. But it seems to me essential, if we're going to ask the American people to sacrifice, that the Government take the lead and show the way. We're also fighting, however, to do something no Government has done before, to both reduce the deficit and increase targeted investments in areas that are designed to secure the future of this country, in the ones Governor Cuomo mentioned: in Head Start; in the program to get children off to a healthier start in life with immunizations and nutrition; in better programs for apprenticeship training for our work force: in opening the doors of college education to all Americans through reforming the student loan process and a program of national service; in new incentives for our industries to develop new technology. These are things which other countries do as a matter of course and take for granted and which lead to huge increases in productivity. The case for them should be plain in America once inessential spending has been cut. The cuts, however, must be credible. And credibility is difficult to come by in Washington today. They must be legally enforceable. They must be plain to the American people. After 12 years of rising deficits and Americans feeling deceived about the issue, I don't blame the people of this country for being distrustful about what they hear from Washington when it comes to bringing down this deficit. That is why I have decided today to propose that we establish a deficit reduction trust fund and put every penny of new taxes and the budget cuts proposed in my budget into the trust fund so the American people know that it has to go to deficit reduction. There are several members of the New York congressional delegation here today. I thank them all for being here, and I thank especially Congressman Schumer for his leadership on this issue. I thank Senator Moynihan for his support of this issue. Senator Moynihan said on the way up here that he thought we ought to do it to win a victory for the clarity of our determination to reduce the deficit. Senator Bradley had an op-ed piece in the paper today endorsing the idea. The time has come to prove that when we say we're going to do something with the people's money, we actually do it. Let me repeat what this means. We will create a trust fund in which every dollar that is raised will go to deficit reduction and in which all the net budget cuts which have been approved will do so also. This is very important. This seriousness, however, should not relieve us of our obligation to recognize that over the long run we must also bring down the investment deficit in this country. I am as dedicated to that as I ever have been. I know that long-term economic growth depends on high-quality and comprehensive education and training, converting the workers and the investments from defense that is being cut to new technologies which must be increased, establishing new and innovative partnerships with the private sector and, as I said earlier, opening the doors of college education to all Americans. But bringing the deficit down will give us the freedom to do that. This budget saves, as I said, about $500 billion. And the trust fund will ensure that we do just that. It will be a change in the way Washington does business. It has broad support. But I also want to emphasize that it will only confirm the direction on which we have embarked. The financial markets here in New York have already understood the seriousness of this administration. Look what's happened to long-term interest rates just since the election, just since the election: mortgage rates at a 20-year low, many other interest rates at record lows. All the analysts say that if this can continue a few more months in this period, we will see about $100 billion freed up for investment in America through people refinancing their home loans and business loans and taking out car loans and consumer loans at lower interest rates. This is a job stimulus program that is big and important. And bringing the deficit down so that the huge overhang of private and public debt of the 1980's can be refinanced is a great strategy to begin the economic renewal of America, and we must stick with it. More can be done. But to do more we have to actually rethink the whole way the Federal Government operates: How does it operate on its own terms? How does it relate to the States and the private sector? I asked the Congress to give me some more money for technology so I could run the White House with many fewer people than my predecessors had. I asked that we have a 14-percent across-the-board cut in the administrative costs of the Federal Government over the next few years: 100,000 reduction in the payroll by attrition, over $9 billion in savings simply by administrative changes alone. But that is just the beginning. I have also asked Vice President Gore to head a task force which will reexamine every agency of the Federal Government, every program of the Federal Government, and the whole way it is organized. Every major company in America had to go through a wrenching reexamination process in the 1980's. The Federal Government had many of its Departments cut, but the way it operated continued to be largely unexamined. It is time that we impose the same sort of reexamination process on the National Government. When we do it, we will find more savings, and more importantly, we will increase the quality of service to the American people. Finally, I want to compliment the House of Representatives last week on passing a bill with the mind-boggling title of enhanced rescission. But when you strip it away, what it amounts to is a modified line-item veto, which is enjoyed by most Governors and which will enable the President to strike out spending items that he believes are unnecessary but will give the Congress the freedom to put them back in after voting on them individually so, that the people can make their own judgment and so can the Members of Congress. These things will make the Federal Government more efficient and will set us on the path to long-term reform. We ought to also think about our partnership with the private sector and our partnership with State and local government. Mayor Dinkins mentioned it. I was gratified to see a couple of mentions in the press recently about the fact that our administration had tried to give cities more relief from unnecessary regulations and States more leeway in promoting various kinds of reform in health care. I just told Governor Cuomo that I was very excited about the health care reform package that he put forward in New York, and Hillary's task force has been very much influenced by the New York reforms. We believe that a lot of the problems of America can be solved by cities and States if the National Government will have targeted investment and then will give people their head to do what they know needs to be done. You'd be amazed how many programs have quite a bit of money in them, but most of the money, or a great deal of the money, never reaches the ultimate beneficiaries at the State or the city level because of all the layers in between. You'd be amazed. I was in Chicago a couple of days ago, and the Mayor of Chicago told me that there are one or two programs that his staff wouldn't even let him try to get for Chicago because the administrative hassle of securing the funds was so great. We're going to change that. We're going to have a new and different and vibrant process that trusts the people of New York and their elected leaders, and the State of New York and their elected leaders, and people throughout the country to have real innovation in the same way that I think we want in the private sector in the United States. But finally, let me say&mdash; &mdash;the Mayor, the lone clapper. We also have proposed to change the relationship between the Government and the private sector in a tax reform package that Senator Moynihan will soon take up if it passes the House, and I hope it does. There will be significant incentives for businesses, large and small, to increase their investment in this country and to be rewarded for it. We will have initiatives that will empower neighborhoods and give people significant incentives to go into neighborhoods in small towns and rural areas and in big cities to put real investment there to create real jobs. We'll provide people real incentives to end welfare as we know it and require them to move forward with that. We will do things that are different from what either party has done before to try to empower people to live up to their God-given potential in a new and different partnership between the United States and people in the private sector. When you strip it all away, there's still one more tough question that has to be answered. If you want the deficit brought down, we have to face the fact that in 1981, taxes were cut by 6 percent of the national income of this country, twice what President Reagan originally recommended when he was elected President. And that gap has never been made up. David Stockman, President Reagan's Budget Director, has an interview in a magazine called the New Politics Quarterly this month in which he says, I don't agree with all of President Clinton's spending plan, but at least he's telling the truth. You cannot fix the deficit without a tax program, because we cut taxes more than twice as much as we proposed to do it when we came in. We got into a bidding war. We got carried away. What we did was irresponsible. And then all the politicians since then never had the stomach to tell the American people the truth. And it was just more fun to cut taxes and pass out money than to do the reverse. Now, that is the hard truth. I really believed in the campaign that we could raise revenues modestly on upper income people, close some corporate tax loopholes, and do some other things, do the spending cuts, and bring the deficit down. After I was elected, the Government announced that the annual deficit was going to be $50 billion a year bigger in 3 of the 4 years that I would serve as President, $50 billion a year bigger, and $15 billion bigger in the fourth year. And it became clear to me that under those circumstances we could not begin by cutting anyone's taxes; that we ought to have a responsible, balanced energy tax and that most of the tax burden should be borne by those who had their taxes lowered in the eighties while their incomes went up, people in higher income groups; but that we ought to have a balanced and fair package, not to soak the rich but to share the burden, to try to say this is our job. And so I say to you, yes, I will put this money in a trust fund, but that does not mean the money does not have to be paid. If you want the interest rates to stay down, if you want the profits of lower interest rates, you must undergo the pain of the spending cuts and the tax increases, because that's the only way to really bring the deficit down. Now, the question is, are we going to do this, or not? Are we going to do this, or not?Audience members. Yes, we are.I think we are. There are some who say no. Today in Washington there are 80,000 lobbyists. It's a growth industry. I'll guarantee you one thing, I created some jobs since I got to be President. But the Congress is now dealing with two bills which will help to reform the way our politics work. They just passed the motor voter bill, something young people of America really wanted and which I'm very proud of, which I hope and pray will continue the trend of increased voter participation. But now Congress is dealing with two tough other issues. The United States Senate passed last week a bill&mdash;finally, believe it or not, in the year 1993&mdash;finally requiring everybody who actually lobbies them to register as a lobbyist and requiring that the gifts that they give to Members of Congress or the expenditures they make on trips or whatever all be reported. Believe it or not, they weren't done before now. The Congress passed that with only two dissenting votes&mdash;the Senate did. The bill is now going to the House. In addition to that, last Friday I proposed a comprehensive campaign finance reform law which will lower the cost of congressional campaigns, reduce the influence of political action committees, and open the airwaves to challengers as well as incumbents for more honest debate. It is a tough, good bill. If we can pass these bills, they will help to open the system too. People are full of hope now. We've received in 3 1/2 months more letters than the White House got in all of 1992. If you haven't gotten yours answered, I hope you'll be patient. We've got over 200 volunteers coming in just to open the mail and trying to sort it and read it. But it is a wonderful reaffirmation, the critical and the complimentary and support letters alike, that Americans really want their system to respond to them again. And we must do that. If the first issue is the economy&mdash;or in the vernacular of my old campaign sign, It's the economy, stupid&mdash;that means deficit reduction, investment for jobs and technology, and education. It means controlling health care costs and dealing with that crisis. I should tell you that no matter how much we reduce the deficit in the next 5 years, it will go fight back up again if we don't address health care costs, because that's the fastest growing part of the Federal budget deficit. It must include all these things, as well as political reform and changing the way Government works. And change is hard. It doesn't happen overnight. You have to do what Lincoln did: Ask hard questions, give strong answers, and hope the American people rally. We can move forward. We can have a whole new partnership in this country, one that goes beyond the things that normally divide us, beyond the dividing lines of party, of race, of gender, of region, of income. We can do that. Ideas and energy can replace drift and delay. We can grow in wealth and wisdom and liberty. But this requires more than good ideas and more than political energy. If I may say, if you don't remember anything else I say, I hope you'll remember this: The human condition in the end changes by faith. And faith cannot be held in your hand. The Scripture that I carry to my place of worship every Sunday says, Faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things unseen. But make no mistake about it, it is by far the most powerful force that can ever be mustered in the cause of change. Today we are seeing too much cynicism and too little faith, an obsession with the moment, an obsession with the politicians and their wins and their losses, an obsession with blame and division, an obsession with paralysis, an obsession with always pointing out the pain of change and never embracing its promise. Without faith, in the end we always wind up resorting to the easy and the immediate: Tax the other guy; cut that other program, not mine; wait for somebody to deliver the goods to me, or wait for it not to happen till I can blame somebody else for what didn't. But faith changes all that. Lincoln's cause in 1860 was to keep our house from dividing. Our cause today is to put our house in order. If a house divided against itself cannot stand, surely a house in disarray will not provide shelter and a home. Surely a house where problems are denied or blamed on someone else in the next room can never be a home for America. To preserve the American dream in our time and for your future, yes, our leaders must ask tough questions and give strong answers. But people must rally to the cause of change with faith. We have to believe again, believe through the frustrations and the difficulties of the moment, as Martin Luther King characterized them, believe through the inevitable rocks in the road to the ends of the journey. We must believe through the smallness and the spite that conflict always brings out in all of us. We must believe through that, to the spirit and generosity and courage that is America at its essence. Mr. Lincoln closed his Cooper Union speech with the following words: Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith, let us to the end dare to do our duty as we understand it. My fellow Americans, our clear duty is to revive the American dream and restore the American economy. And for as long as it takes, with energy and joy and humility, let us dare to do that duty.Thank you very much.",clinton
"Thank you very much. To Bruce and to Lew, and to all of you, I've had a wonderful time tonight. These lights are so bright. I only know half the people I've shaken hands with. It has been a wonderful time. I want to thank all the people who made this dinner possible, and I want to thank the wonderful entertainment. The choir was terrific. The group doing all the wonderful old songs from Dionne Warwick in the sixties were magnificent. I was delighted to see Barry Manilow again in such wonderful voice, and grateful for his many contributions to our common efforts. I appreciated Phil Hartman saying he voted for me, but it's not quite enough for all the abuse I've put up with in advance. And I want to say to my friend, Whoopi Goldberg: Mayor Dinkins has a telephone call for you over here if you will go over and get it. Ladies and gentlemen, all of you who made this night possible&mdash;Lew and Bruce, Bob Rose and the other committee members, Bob Barrie, Bill Boardman, Paul Montrone, George Norcross, Felix Rohatyn, Ann Sheffer, John Sweeney, and Steve Swid, thank you all. Thank you, Roy Furman. Thank you, David Wilhelm. A lot of you were here with me a long time ago. I remember once, more than a year ago, when I came to New York and there were hundreds of people here in a hotel for a fund-raiser for me. I was dropping like a rock in New Hampshire. All those experts said I was dead. I hear their call again. People who couldn't see the long road and didn't want to think of the fight as something that was bigger than any person were all preoccupied. And I just couldn't believe all these folks were even showing up for a dinner in New York. It was so dark in the campaign, I thought, well, people will go ahead and send their checks and then stay home. I imagined going into this vast ballroom and making a speech to eight people. And I was feeling pretty sorry for myself, frankly. And I told this story many times, but a man stopped me in the hall who was working at the hotel and said that he was a Greek immigrant and he was going to vote for me because his son asked him to&mdash;was only 10 years old-that if I got elected, he wanted me to do something for his son. He said, Where I come from, we were poor but we were free. Here, I make more money, but my boy's not free. He can't go across the street and play in the park without accompaniment from me. He can't even go to his school safely without my going with him. And I want you to work to help make my boy free. And it made me remember what politics was all about. I don't even remember what I said that night, but I know all of a sudden I had forgotten about me and started thinking about the rest of America. And I think that is what we ought to think about tonight. When we talk about a program, it only counts if there are people behind it. New York City, for all of the problems you may think you have, has registered the first decline in the crime rate in 36 years, because you did something about community policing. So we know now that there is a strategy which can make people freer. That's what personal safety is. And there is no excuse for not doing something about it. And that's what politics is about: focusing on the dreams and hopes and fears and needs of people. Sometimes I think that when we have these wonderful dinners, which are delightful to me, I've gotten to see some of you that I haven't even seen since the election, just to say a simple thank you to you. Remember, we all did it so that we can make a difference in people's lives. I want to say a special word of tribute here with all the people from New York and New Jersey and Connecticut, and my friend Mayor Rendell and others here from Pennsylvania, and there's even a handful of folks here from my home State. They were the ones who were clapping when Lew Katz gave his Arkansas pander, which I appreciate. I want to say a special word about one person who is here. I want to congratulate my friend Jim Florio on winning the John F. Kennedy Profiles in Courage Award, for facing the financial problems of his State, for facing the educational problems of his State and, yes, for being willing to stand up for the police officers and the people of his cities and State who wanted to be safe from crime, standing up to the gun lobby, and being for safe streets. That's why he got the award, doing real things, even if they weren't so hot in the polls at the time. Now our country is being called upon together to try to do the things that we just talked about in the campaign. Governor Mario Cuomo said again today when he introduced me at the Cooper Union that we campaign in poetry, but we must govern in prose. It's another way of saying, and a more eloquent way of saying, it's a lot easier to talk about change than it is to do it. I was overwhelmed today to have the opportunity to speak on the same spot where Abraham Lincoln spoke at the Cooper Union in 1860. And I went back and read large portions of Mr. Lincoln's speech. He came to the Cooper Union and catapulted himself into the nomination of the Republican Party, into the Presidency, and into the history and hearts of America. He did it by saying this is a difficult time, we have to ask hard questions and give strong answers. He said that we could not allow slavery to continue to expand; and that if we did, it would destroy the United States. He said in many other places that if the house is divided against itself, it could not stand. Lincoln went on to become President, and he expanded his vision, and he eventually signed the Emancipation Proclamation abolishing slavery. In the White House we have a painting called Waiting for the Hour, of black slaves watching a clock at 5 minutes to 12, waiting for the stroke of midnight, January 1st, 1863, for the Emancipation Proclamation to become effective. Several times a week, often late at night, I go alone into the room where Lincoln signed that proclamation, and I remembered what the Presidency is really for: to help the American people move forward. It is for us now to put this house in order. And the beginning is to stop denying our problems and to accept some common responsibility for solving them. The first thing we have to do is to prove that the Government can be trusted with your money by passing a budget that will bring the deficit down. Look what has happened. Look what has happened just since the election, because finally the country has an administration trying to do that: long-term interest rates going down very low, 20-year low; billions of dollars, tens of billions being recycled into this economy, giving people the opportunity to make new starts. We have got to do that. We also have to deal with this health care crisis. You know, so many of you said nice things about Hillary tonight, and I want to say I appreciate it, because about every third day she stops speaking to me because I asked her to run the health care project. It is the most complex, the most daunting task in our domestic life. But it is also perhaps the most urgent. If we cannot give working families the security of knowing they're not going to lose their health care, if we can't give businesses the security of knowing that health care doesn't have to go up at 2 or 3 times the rate of inflation, if we can't provide coverage to the 35 million Americans which don't have it, if we can't face the crises of AIDS and the lack of health care in rural areas and big cities, and if we can't invest in research in those things that we have not come to grips with in health care, what can we do as a country? Every other nation has done a better job of many of these things than we do, and so we must. They say, well, you should only do one thing at a time. You can't walk and chew gum at the same time in Washington, that's what they say. But I say we will do one thing at a time, but we have to honestly put it all out there. If you want to bring the deficit down, you have to do health care. The only purpose of bringing the deficit down is to make the economy healthy. You have to invest in new technologies and give people incentives to create opportunity for others. It is not so simple as to say, well, just think about this and let another idea cross your mind a year or two from now. We have got to be about the business of rebuilding America. And we can do that if we keep our eyes on the whole picture: bring the debt down, invest in our future, deal with the health care crisis, deal with the special problems of special people in special areas that have been left out and left behind. I believe we can do these things. I also have to tell you here at this magnificent fund-raiser tonight that I am so humbled that so many of you have helped me for so long and asked for nothing in return, and others have done it in spite of the fact that many of the changes that I have advocated are not in your personal, immediate, short-term interest. You ought to be proud of that, because I'm proud of you. One of the problems that has just killed this country is that all of us have had our blinders on and we've been able to see about 6 inches in front of our eyes. And all of Washington for too long has been dominated by that: 80,000 lobbyists, because of the absence of a compelling national public vision, each picking apart the public interest. Now I think we have to follow through also on our commitment to political reform, to campaign finance reform, to lower the cost of campaigns, reduce the influence of PAC's, and open the airwaves to challengers. It'll also be nicer for you if you could only go to one dinner a year instead of four or five. It's a good thing. We should do it. I also believe that we have to continue on this whole reform track. We passed a modified line-item veto in the House of Representatives. The Senate ought to pass it and let the President take the heat for controlling unnecessary spending. We ought to continue to work to open up the political process. Hallelujah, the gridlock was broken yesterday, and the United States Congress passed the motor voter bill to open up the political process to young people all across the country. These are things that can make a difference. We have to begin to think about America in terms of what's in it for all of us together so that we can move forward together. Let me just mention one or two things tonight. A couple of days ago I was in Cleveland, and on the way out of town, I went by a little pierogi place started by a wonderful young woman who wanted to start her own restaurant, couldn't get a bank loan. She came from a big Polish family, so she just took the Cleveland phone book and called hundreds of people with Polish surnames and asked them to invest in her business until she got 80 folks who'd give her $3,000 apiece, and she's doing real well now. They're the kind of people that we ought to be fighting for. When I got to another one of my meetings, I saw a woman who had six children and was supporting these children all by herself, making a handsome salary that she had to give up because one of her children was so desperately ill the only way she could afford the child's health care was to become eligible for Government assistance, because we don't have a health care system. And she was there in my speech with her beloved child and their $100,000-amonth medical bills. They're the people who are worth fighting for. I received a letter yesterday from a wonderful young man and his wife who became friends of mine in New Hampshire and had a desperately ill child who had troubles at birth. And he lost his health insurance and he had to choose between working and not working to get on public assistance, and he struggled on. And the letter says that he just had to file for bankruptcy, but he hasn't given up on himself or his family or his country, and he wants me to keep fighting to make the economy better. That's what this whole effort is all about. There are real people and lives and dramas worthy of the greatest admiration behind so many stories in this room, so many stories in this country. I ask you for your continued support. I ask you to support the suggestion I made today that we're going to put all this money we're trying to raise into a deficit-reduction trust and say to the American people, every dollar of the tax will go to reduce the debt, and none of the taxes will be raised without the spending cuts. Tell the Congress that we ought to do it, instead of just fooling around with it and talking about it. But I ask you, finally, to remember that the atmosphere in which we labor, you and I, is still heavily laden with cynicism and skepticism. People have been disappointed on and off for 20 years. I was looking the other night at a little bit of history, an account of the Kennedy administration, reminding me that when President Kennedy was elected, the same sort of time, the same sort of moment, except that over 70 percent of the American people, when he went in, believed that leaders told the truth to the American people and believed they could trust their leaders to do the right thing. We don't have that today. One of the things that those of you who had some personal contact and personal involvement in this administration can do is to help to restore the sense of faith that the American people used to take for granted. We simply can never succeed, ever, if every step along the way is burdened with people who are denying their own responsibility, waiting for someone to deliver them while making no effort, waiting for someone else to blame, letting the spite that comes out of every conflict overcome the larger vision and purposes that we are about. I am telling you, if we could do one thing tonight that would guarantee the success of everything else we're going to do, it would be all of us in our own way to walk out of here and say, let's try to put aside all of our differences and think about how we can lift up the people of this country. Let us, for a few months, suspend all of our cynicism and instead put our faith in the process that took us to the polls last November. Let us try to bring out the best in one another even in the most heated debates in the Congress. I worry from time to time only about one thing, and that is that the people who have to make these decisions will not feel the energy of the American people desperately saying, Change, have the courage to change. Challenge me, bring out the best in me. Do not give in to the pressures and the temptations of the moment but go forward to a better life. I ask all of you, too, to remember that I'm going to get up every day and go to work and work hard. Some days I work smarter than other days, but every day I'll work hard. I ask you to remember that one of the great challenges of being President is to try to devote enough time and attention to the job to get the job done and save enough time to stay among the people, selling what you've done and listening and making the proper adjustment when there is something more you need to learn. I asked so many of you back during the election not to take the election as the end but the beginning of this enterprise. And so I invite you again to be a part of this great enterprise, with your ideas as well as your spirit. We've got 4 years of work to do. We can move this country forward in great ways and in profound ways that will benefit millions, indeed all, of the people of this country. But it's going to take every last good idea, and every last ounce of will and vision, and every ounce of courage and faith. You have to be a part of that. I want you to leave here tonight knowing that I still want that just as badly as I did in the election. I did not run for this job to move into The White House, as great an honor as that is. I did not run for this job even to have the enormous privilege of standing on Harry Truman's balcony and looking at the statue of Thomas Jefferson every night. I ran for it to be faithful to the tradition they established by making your life better, and you have to help me do that.Thank you and God bless you all.",clinton
"Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Governor Romer, ladies and gentlemen. I felt pretty good sitting at that table although that's my real place over there. We had a wonderful meeting yesterday, I thought, for a long time, maybe the longest time a President has ever met with a group of Governors, but we were discussing a terribly important issue: health care. And then we also got to discuss the deficit crisis and the budget problems a little bit. I wanted to come here today, as you prepare to leave, to once again reaffirm my commitment to working in partnership with the Governors. You deal with real people in a more immediate way than, unfortunately, the President often gets to do. When I was a Governor, every day I would hear directly from people or see people who had suffered from layoffs or had their businesses closed down or who were afraid of losing their health coverage or who desperately wanted to improve their schools. As you and I learned from last year's elections, the only pattern was not a partisan one. It was a pattern of determination on the part of the American people to have their political system and their Government address their real concerns. They don't want our process divided by partisanship or dominated by special interest or driven by short-term advantage. They know things that have too often been forgotten here over the last dozen years. The values that are central to our country's character must be central to our Government: work, family, faith, opportunity, responsibility, and community. What I appreciated about this meeting is that no matter what our region or our party, we've always gotten together and tried to pay serious attention to our problems. I think the Governors have exemplified for the last dozen years the bold, persistent experimentation that President Roosevelt called for at the beginning of the Great Depression when he took office. And I'm here to tell you that I'm going to do everything I can to work with you in partnership to share ideas and resources and energy to try to do what we can to move this country forward. As we discussed health care, economic policy, and the deficit yesterday, I'd like to spend just a few moments today talking about something that many of us have been working on since the middle 1980's, the issue of welfare reform. I've often spoken with many of you about the need to end welfare as we know it, to make it a program that supports people who have fallen on hard times or who have difficulties that can be overcome, but eventually and ultimately a program that helps people to get on their feet through health care, child care, job training, and ultimately a productive job. No one likes the we]fare system as it currently exists, least of all the people who are on it. The taxpayers, the social service employees themselves don't think much of it either. Most people on welfare are yearning for another alternative, aching for the chance to move from dependence to dignity. And we owe it to them to give them that chance. In the middle 1980's, when I was a Governor here, I worked with Governor Castle, now a Member of the Congress&mdash;he and Governor Carper changed jobs, and in 6 months they're going to have a vote to see who won and who lost&mdash; &mdash;to try to work with the Congress to develop a national welfare reform program. With the support of people in the House and the Senate, with the particular help of Senator Moynihan, now the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and with the support of The White House, the Governors had an unprecedented role in writing the Family Support Act of 1988, which President Reagan signed into law shortly before he left office and which Senator Moynihan said was the most significant piece of social reform in this area in the last generation. The Family Support Act embodies a principle which I believe is the basis of an emerging consensus among people without regard to party or without regard to their traditional political philosophies. We must provide people on welfare with more opportunities for job training, with the assurance that they will receive the health care and child care they need when they go to work, and with all the opportunities they need to become self-sufficient. But then we have to ask them to make the most of these opportunities and to take a job. As all of you know, the States never had the chance to fully implement the Welfare Reform Act of 1988 for two reasons: first, because over the last 4 years the welfare rolls have exploded everywhere and health care costs have gone up as the job market has declined and the economy has grown at the slowest rate in half a century; secondly, because of the economic problems, Government revenues have been down and the Congress and the administration were never able to fully fund the education and training portion of the act. This was clearly manifested not only in the growth of welfare rolls but in the fact that last year, for the first time since the program began, 1 in 10 Americans were on food stamps. So as the weak economy left millions of more in poverty, and the welfare rolls increased 5 times greater during the last 4 years than under the previous two administrations combined, it made it more difficult to make welfare reform work. In spite of that, I think it would be a great mistake to conclude that that act was of no significance or that nothing good has occurred. Bipartisan efforts in State after State from New Jersey to Georgia, to Wisconsin, and many others all across the country, have resulted in innovative approaches to help move people off welfare rolls and onto payrolls. In our State, through the program we call Project Success, more than 17,000 people moved from welfare to work. And more importantly, at a time when the rolls were exploding, our rolls grew much more slowly than the national average. Many of you have your own successes to report, and I had the opportunity to visit, in many of the States here represented, projects that were terribly impressive to me. I say this to make the following point: The bill that is on the books will work, given the right economy and the right kind of support systems, but we need to do more than fully implement it; we need to do that and go beyond. I salute you for forming a State officials advisory group on welfare reform with Governors and legislators and health and welfare directors from 10 States. I want to tell you today that within the next 10 days I will announce a welfare reform group to work with you. I will ask top officials from The White House, the Health and Human Services, and other agencies involved to sit down with Governors and congressional leaders and develop a welfare reform plan that will work. I have asked the best people in the Nation on this subject to come and help me do this. The day I took office I promised the American people I would fight for more opportunity for all and demand more responsibility from all. And that is a commitment I am determined to keep, with your help, by putting an end to welfare as we know it. Our working group will learn from and work with State officials, business and labor folks, and leaders from every walk of life who care about this issue. On welfare reform, as on health care reform, there are no top-down, made-in-Washington solutions that will work for everyone. The problems and the progress are to be found in the communities of this country. But I do want to tell you the principles this morning that will guide my administration as we work with you to reform welfare. First, welfare should be a second chance, not a way of life. I want to give people on welfare the education and training and the opportunities they need to become self-sufficient. To make sure they can do it after they go to work, they must still have access to health care and to child care. So many people stay on welfare not because of the checks; the benefit levels, as many of you know, in real dollar terms are lower than they were 20 years ago. They do it solely because they do not want to put their children at risk of losing health care or because they do not have the money to pay for child care out of the meager wages they can earn coming from a low education base. We have got to deal with that. I believe 2 years after a training program is completed, you have to ask people to take a job ultimately, either in the private sector or in public service. There must be, in addition to the full implementation of the welfare reform act of 1988, in my opinion, a time-certain beyond which people don't draw a check for doing nothing when they can do something. And there is a lot of work out there to be done. Senator Boren and Senator Wofford have offered a bill to try to recreate on a very limited basis a pilot project that would take the best of what was done with the work programs of the thirties and try to throw them into the context of the nineties. We must begin now to plan for a time when people will ultimately be able to work for the check they get, whether the check comes from a private employer or from the United States taxpayers. Today, about half the people on welfare are just the people welfare was meant to help. They fall on hard times, and they have to have public assistance. They're eager to move on with their lives. And after 5 or 6 months or 8 months they're right back at work again, struggling to make their way in the American way. About half the people on welfare stay on for over 2 years. But one in four persons, the people that we really need to try to help to break the cycle that is gripping their children and grandchildren, about one in four stays a recipient for 8 years or longer. Those are the folks that Governor Wilder I know is now working on, that many of you have tried to address the problems of, and I want to help you with that. Second, we need to make work pay. We have to make sure that every American who works full-time, with a child in the home, does not live in poverty. If there is dignity in all work, there must be dignity for every worker. Therefore, I will propose an expansion in the earned-income tax credit which supplements the income of the working poor.We can do that. We ought to be able to lift people who work 40 hours a week, with kids in their home, out of poverty. And we will remove the incentive for staying in poverty. It will be much less expensive than to have Government direct supplements to pay people to remain idle. And it will reinforce the work ethic. If we can do that and at the same time do what we discussed yesterday, control health care costs and expand coverage so that no one has to stay on welfare just to take care of their children's medical needs, I think you will see a dramatic breakthrough in our efforts to liberate people from their dependency. Third, we need tougher child support enforcement. An estimated 15 million children have parents who could pay child support but don't. We need to make sure that they do. Parents owe billions of dollars in child support that is unpaid, money that could go a long way toward cutting the welfare rolls and lifting single parents out of poverty and money that could go a long way toward helping us control Government expenditures and reducing that debt. We're going to toughen child support enforcement by creating a national databank to track down deadbeat parents, by having the States go as far as they possibly can to establish paternity at the hospital when children are born, and if I can prevail up here, by using the IRS to collect unpaid support in seriously delinquent cases. I've said it before because it's the simple truth: Governments don't raise children, people do. And even people who aren't around ought to do their part to raise the children they bring into this world. Fourth, we need to encourage experimentation in the States. I will say again what you know so well: There are many promising initiatives right now at the State and local level, and we will work with you to encourage that kind of experimentation. I do not want the Federal Government, in pushing welfare reforms based on these general principles, to rob you of the ability to do more, to do different things. And I want to try to flesh out a little bit of the idea we discussed yesterday about the waivers. My view is that we ought to give you more elbow room to experiment. I know I was perplexed during the recent campaign when I tried to make a statement that some people in the press said reflected waffling, and it seemed to me to express the real genius of the federal system. I said that if I were President I would approve waivers of experiments that I did not necessarily agree with. And they said, You're trying to have it both ways. I said, No, I'm not. I'm trying to honor the Founding Fathers. If we didn't disagree on anything, what would be the need for experiments? That is the nature of the experiment, is that one person has an idea different from another person. So I will encourage all of us to work together to try things that are different. And the only thing I want to ask you in return is, let us measure these experiments and let us measure them honestly, so that if they work, we can make them the rule, we can all adopt things that work. And if they don't, we can stop and try something else. That's the only thing I ask of you. If we say, okay, we're going to have more waivers and you're going to be able to experiment in projects that use Federal dollars, let's measure the experiment, let's be honest about it. And if it works, let's tell everybody it works so we can all do it. And if it doesn't, let's have the courage to quit and admit it didn't. I think all of us want what most people on welfare want, a country that gives you a hand up, not a handout. We don't have a person to waste. We need the talent, the energy, the skills of every man and woman, every boy and girl in this country. Of all the problems we have with competitiveness, whether it is the deficit or the level of investment or anything else, I think all of us know in our heart of hearts America's biggest problem today is that too many of our people never get a shot at the American dream and that if all of our people were living up to the fullest of their potential, we would surely have a much easier path in solving all the issues that we constantly debate about at these meetings. Of all my moments as Governor, one I remember with the most pride occurred here at a National Governors' Association meeting during that 2-year period when we were working on welfare reform. Governor Castle and I sponsored a panel, and I think 40 Governors attended. And we had welfare recipients from all over the country come in and talk to the Governors about what it was like to be on welfare. A woman from Arkansas who was there, whom I knew but had not vetted for this conversation, started talking about her program and how she'd gone into a training program and she had gotten a job, all of that. And I did something lawyers are told never to do: I asked a question without knowing the answer. I said, Do you think this program ought to be mandatory? Should everybody have to participate in this? She said, I sure do. And I said, Why? And she said, Well, because if it wasn't, there would be a lot of people like me home watching the soaps because we don't believe we can make anything of ourselves anymore. So you've got to make it mandatory. And I said, What's the best thing about having a job? She said, When my boy goes to school, and they say, 'What does your mama do for a living?', he can give an answer. I think that moment says more than I will ever be able to say about why this is important, not just important for the poor but important for the rest of us. We must end poverty for Americans who want to work. And we must do it on terms that dignify all of the rest of us, as well as help our country to work better. I need your help, and I think we can do it. Thank you very much.",clinton
"Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President. Mr. Panetta, Ms. Rivlin, ladies and gentlemen. I'm really sorry to know that the Vice President has a lavish office in this building. If it gets any hotter over at the White House he may want to occupy it. I want to tell you how very proud I am to be here today, how grateful I am for the enormous amount of work I know all of you have been doing because of the tight timetables we have set on ourselves leading up to the February 17th address to Congress. Nobody in this country is working any harder than you are to give the promises I made to the American people a chance to take life. And I just wanted to come by here today and say a simple thank you. For years politicians have run for President and Governor and other offices by running against the Government. And to be sure, there is a lot to run against; there is a lot which needs to be changed. There are people here in this room today that know more specifically about what needs to be changed than those of us who give speeches about it. But I think it is terribly important, in the midst of all that rhetoric, not to forget that behind that Government that needs to be changed there are people who have decided to give their lives to the interest of the United States and its citizens. And they deserve to be honored. And I do appreciate that. I wanted to tell you today a little bit about why I think I got elected to this job and what I hope, together, we can do, and most importantly, what's behind the enormous and increasingly complex challenges facing this country. Let me begin by relating a simple experience I had a few months ago which affected me deeply, involving a man named Benjamin Edwards, a 52-year-old man who lived in Philadelphia. The night of the first Presidential debate, he had a viewing party at his house, but it was a highly unusual viewing party. He was out of work, and his electricity had been turned off because he couldn't pay the bills. So his neighbors brought over television sets and lamps and ran extension cords from a nearby apartment because that's the only way they could watch it. About 100 of them did. And the next day Benjamin Edwards took a bus 15 miles to attend one of our campaign rallies. As I came down the line, he grabbed my hand and told me to win the election because he had to have a job. I told him that if I won the election I'd try to get him a job. Well, he's got a job now because he became somewhat famous as a result of this incident. But there are millions and millions of other Americans who still don't. I read an article yesterday in the paper about another unemployed person who had voted for me who had only gotten a form response from the White House. And I told somebody today to pick up the phone and call him and talk to him and try to make him feel connected to his Government again. I say this to reiterate something that I think most of you already know, but it's easy to forget here working in the splendid isolation of the Capital City. Budgets are not about numbers; they're about people. They mean jobs and health care, education or training. We can't ever afford to let our people get lost in a blizzard of statistics. Since the election we've learned even more about the difficulty of the budgets and the difficulty of putting together an economic program that puts people to work in the short run and deals with the long-term problems of this economy. Just today we got the news about the economic indicators for the month of December being the best in 10 years and yet the disturbing prospect that a lot of new jobs are not being created. How could this be so? Well, partly because there's been no inflation in the economy and interest rates have been down for some while; people are now beginning to refinance their home, debts, or buy and sell new homes, so that generates a lot of economic activity. And partly because we have an inordinate number of companies in our free enterprise system who have gotten more and more productive and therefore earning more money. The problem is that a lot of them are doing what we need to do, which is to gradually downsize. A lot of them are not hiring new people, even though their incomes are going way up. Now, during the eighties that happened to the Fortune 500 companies, which reduced employment by over a couple hundred thousand a year all during the eighties. But all those jobs were made up for in the eighties by small businesses hiring new people. And yet, now small business hiring is dropping, too, as small businesses are loathe to hire new people because they can't afford to pay for health care or because they can't get credit from their local banks. So we have this anomalous situation where the economy seems to be growing but employment is not, and where more and more middle-income workers are working harder and harder every year but their wages aren't keeping up with inflation, and the costs of health care and education are outstripping inflation. So we have this perplexing dilemma. How can we build on what the free enterprise system is doing that is good, get small business growth going again, and increase investment so that we generate more high-wage jobs, so that the economy can grow, not just in the overall statistics but in the real lives of real people? That's important to you, not only because of your mission at OMB but because how you do is a reflection of how the taxpayers do, since they pay your bill. So you have an immediate as well as a long-range interest in the success of what is our economic commitment: to do something which the American people have never before had to do, to increase investment and bring down the deficit at the same time. That is our challenge. And on February 17 we're going to start anew in an effort to meet that challenge. We've got to turn this country around to build a long-term stable growth of jobs and income. We cannot go 10 more years with insufficient jobs and insufficient income growth for people who are working hard, playing by the rules, willing to become educated and trained in ever-new skills, meeting ever-new challenges. That is our challenge. And we are doing our best to meet it. Since no one has ever tried to do both these things at once, to get the job base going, which we want to do with a modest stimulus program in the beginning, increase permanently investment in people and jobs and growth, and reduce the deficit, it is not always clear exactly what specific decisions we must make. But the general path we have to follow is clear, because if we don't do something about investment, we won't have the kind of high-wage jobs that will shape a good future for ourselves and our children. If we don't do something about the deficit, it will eventually overwhelm our ability to borrow money at affordable rates and to have any money left in the public purse to take care of people in need and to invest in our future. So we have no choice but to embark on this course, but it is an uncharted course. No one has ever tried to do both things at the same time before. President Roosevelt elected to pursue investments in putting the American people back to work; deflation was so bad he didn't have to worry about the deficit. And before he had to deal with it, we were in a world war with full production and a massive deficit that then dropped dramatically as a percentage of our income for the next 35 years for the simple reason that we were growing so fast we didn't have to worry about it. Now we need a new commitment to investment, but we cannot ignore our debt. We have to remember a few basic things, I think, in putting this program together. The first is that while every American is willing to make a contribution, the contribution we ask of every American must be viewed against what happened to them in the 1980's. In the 1980's, the middle class paid the bill while the wealthiest Americans enjoyed the fruits of their labors. Taxes went up on middle class Americans while their real incomes went down. Taxes went down on upper income Americans while their real incomes went up. The expansion of Government services, the expansion of all the public programs was basically done on the backs of the people who weren't having any income growth. That means before we ask them to do more, we have to demand that Government do everything it can to do with less. Before I ask working Americans to work harder and pay more, I will ask the economic elite, who made more money and paid less in taxes, to pay their fair share. We have to literally be about the business, as Vice President Gore said first, of reinventing Government. I have been very careful, I will say again, to honor the contribution of public employees. I know that to a major degree, I cannot succeed as President unless you and the people who work in all these other departments believe in our common mission. I know that for every subject I could bring up that I want do do something about, there are 10 employees in this city of the Federal Government who know more about the details of what ought to be done than I do. I need your ideas and your energy. When I say we're going to reinvent Government, we're going to downsize some things; we're going to stop doing other things. We're going to do it in a way that lifts up the influence, the energy, and values the ideas of our best employees, not that grinds them down or uses them as political footballs. I have no interest in doing that to you or to anybody else. I think the American people know you want a change, too. But let me just give you two or three examples. When I took office, the Labor Department had a nice executive dining room for its Secretary but not enough money to train unemployed workers. I'm going to propose a stimulus package that has some more money to train unemployed workers, and the Secretary of Labor is now eating in the dining room with the employees. When I took office, the White House had a telephone system that had been there since President Carter and a switchboard that has been there since the 1960's. They talk about jamming the White House switchboards&mdash;you can do it tomorrow if you want to; it's not hard. I could not have a conference call in my office on my telephone, except an unwanted one. Anybody in the central office could punch a lighted button and listen to what I had to say. The American people, I think, would be pretty surprised and disappointed that after a dozen years of people who promised to run the Government like a business&mdash;they meant a business in the 1950's, not for the 21st century. So we are committed to making the kinds of structural changes that every major organization in this country has had to make in order to survive. It is not right for us to spend taxpayers' money on antiquated communications systems, on unjustifiable perks, and on a system that cannot be, cannot be justified to the American people, given the times that they're having and the sacrifices we're going to ask of them. In the next several days, I will be finalizing and announcing plans which will demonstrate a substantial reduction in spending at The White House, reversing many years of growth in services and personnel provided to the President. We're going to rely more on help from people in the departments to run the Government and on a new partnership to move the country forward. And we're going to set an example by saving money for the taxpayers, which will then have to be followed by everybody else in the executive branch and I hope in the legislative branch as well. Second, I'm going to ask, as I said, those who made more money in the eighties and paid fewer taxes to pay their fair share before I ask anyone in the working middle class to pay more. But we have to recognize that together we have to find a way to change the mix of Government spending away from so much consumption toward more investment and, at the same time, to reduce the deficit so we can bring interest rates down and bring up long-term living standards. We have no right, frankly, to continue to finance a Government budget that is 20 percent debt-financed, and will be more debt-financed in the years ahead, and leave it to our children to figure out how to live with lower incomes than they otherwise would have. And believe me, it isn't just our children. We're going to be living with the consequences in the very near future. And I might add something that all of you who work on budgets know, which is that one of the huge dilemmas we face&mdash;and that can't be resolved today in this speech, but I just want to lay it out there&mdash;is one that all of you know. And that is we are spending 14 percent of our income on health care. No other country except Canada spends more than 9, and they're just a little above 9. And every day we read in the paper another expert, just like there's one today, saying, well, you certainly can't save any money on health care costs in this country. God forbid that you should put any of that in there; you can't do that. If we can't do that, we can't fix the deficit; we can't fix the economy; we can't turn America around. And if we could lower the rate of health care spending increase, we would save more than twice as much money in the private sector and in the public sector, unleashing more money for investment than anything we can do in terms of tax cuts, spending increases, or anything else to turn this economy around. So there's plenty for us to do. What I want you to know is that I do not believe our problems are insoluble. And one of my major goals is to leave the next President with a new set of things to worry about. I'm getting bored reading the same problems in the paper, decade after decade. I want people to have to deal with new problems. I am asking you today to do two things: First of all, to personally invest yourself in this great mission. It is our job in this generation to deal with these problems so that the American dream can endure. Ultimately, that is why everybody should come to work for the Federal Government and why everyone's job counts. And I am asking you to remember how terribly difficult life is for many people who pay our bills and pay your salary and mine. I got an incredibly moving call the other day from a friend of mine, shortly before I took office, in which he said he had just talked to a person who worked in his office who said that&mdash;in bad grammar but compelling truth-he said, This woman came up to me and said, 'You know, it's scary to be a little people.' And it really is. I want to send a signal to this country that I may not do everything right, and I can't do everything that's just popular in the short run, but every day in every way we're trying to set an example for the people that sent us here. We don't want the people to sacrifice their income before the Government sacrifices everything it can. We don't want the people who bore the burden in the eighties to make any contributions before people who reaped the benefits of the eighties do their fair share, and that together we really believe we can make a difference. If you help me and we work together, I'm confident that we can.Thank you, and bless you all.",clinton
"Thank you very much. Congressman Emerson and distinguished guests at the head table; to my friend Reverend Billy Graham and Ruth; and to all those who have given such moving presentations. This has been a wonderful morning, I think, for all of us. When I heard Wentley Phipps recounting our first, rather awkward meeting, I thought that I would admit to being Governor of Alabama just to hear him sing. My mind has been full of memories this morning. I helped to start the first Governor's prayer breakfast in my State; it became a very important part of our life there. And every year I had the pleasure of delegating two Arkansans, one a clergyman or -woman and one a citizen, to come to this wonderful event. I thought about the first time I ever saw Billy Graham&mdash;appropriate to mention now. He came in the 1950's, in the heat of all our racial trouble, to Arkansas to have a crusade. And the white citizens council tried to get him, because of the tensions of the moment, to agree to segregate his crusade in the fifties in the South. And he said, If I have to do that, I'm not coming. And I remember I got a Sunday school teacher in my church&mdash;and I was about 11 years old&mdash;to take me 50 miles to Little Rock so I could hear a man preach who was trying to live by what he said. And then I remember, for a good while thereafter, trying to send a little bit of my allowance to the Billy Graham crusade because of the impression he made on me then. I am honored that all of you are here not for a political purpose. We come here to seek the help and guidance of our Lord, putting aside our differences, as men and women who freely acknowledge that we don't have all the answers. And we come here seeking to restore and renew and strengthen our faith. In this town, as much as any place on the face of the Earth, we need that. We need faith as a source of strength. The assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things unseen, the Scripture says. What it means to me is that here, if we have enough faith, in spite of all the pressures to the contrary, we can define ourselves from the inside out, in a town where everybody tries to define you from the outside in. We need our faith as a source of hope because it teaches us that each of us is capable of redemption and, therefore, that progress is possible&mdash;not perfection, for all the reasons Reverend Graham said, but progress. We need our faith as a source of challenge because if we read the Scriptures carefully, it teaches us that all of us must try to live by what we believe or, in more conventional terms, to live out the admonition of President Kennedy that here on Earth God's work must truly be our own. But perhaps most important of all for me, we need our faith, each of us, President, Vice President, Senator, Congressman, General, Justice, as a source of humility, to remember that, as Bishop Sheen said, we are all sinners. St. Paul once said in an incredibly moving Scripture in the Bible, The very thing which I would not do, that I do, and that which I would, that I do not. And even more, not only because we do wrong but because we don't always know what is right. In funerals and weddings and other important ceremonies, you often hear that wonderful verse from Corinthians cited: Now abideth faith, hope, and love, but the greatest of these is love. But the important thing is often left out, which is the verse above. Why is the greatest of these love? Because now I see through a glass, darkly ... now I know only in part. None of us know all that we need to know to do what we need to do. I have always been touched by the living example of Jesus Christ and moved particularly by all the religious leaders of His day who were suspicious of Him and always trying to trap Him because He was so at ease with the hurting and the hungry and the lonely and, yes, the sinners. And in one of those marvelous attempts to trick Christ, He was asked, What is the greatest Commandment? And He answered, quoting Moses, You shall love the Lord, your God, with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. And then He added, as we should add, This is the great and foremost Commandment. And the second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. Just 2 weeks and a day ago, I took the oath of office as President. You know the last four words, for those who choose to say it in this way, are so help me God. And the Chief Justice was giving me the oath, and I was trying to remember the words. And I said, you know, when I get to the end I'm going to think of the ringing voice of Washington and Jefferson and Lincoln and the Roosevelts and Kennedy and all the other great Presidents through the ages, and I will say so help me God with all the strength at my command. And I did. But deep down inside I wanted to say it the way I was thinking it, which was, So, help me, God. So today my prayer for you as we begin this great new adventure, and I pray that your prayer for me, will be that God will help us to have the strength to define ourselves from the inside out, not the outside in, to have the hope that it takes never to give up and the determination it takes always to make progress in an imperfect world and the humility to walk by faith and not by sight.Thank you very much.",clinton
"Good evening. Thank you. I know we're not really, but it feels like it's nice to be back in New Jersey. And I'm glad to have you here in the Nation's Capital. You may or may not be able to see this, but on the way in tonight, Bill Faherty gave me a New Jersey tie, which I have proudly donned. They even had a mirror outside for me to be able to tie it in a straight and appropriate fashion. I want to tell you how very glad I am to be here tonight with the State chamber, how much I want to welcome you to our Nation's Capital. I've just been here as President 2 weeks and a day, and I'm already hoping we can keep an infusion of people from the heartland coming in to keep us in touch with reality. I'm glad to see all the Members of the House here. Senator Bradley and Senator Lautenberg are voting tonight as the United States Senate attempts to work out the family leave bill. I do want to say a special word of appreciation to both of them in front of their constituents for not only the support they have given me but for the genuinely good advice across a whole wide range of issues. I have the sort of relationship with them which I really respect and which I hope the Members of Congress here will take to heart. Either one of them is liable to call me at any time of the day or night from places unknown. Always all fight places, but&mdash; &mdash;I mean, when they're around, you know. And I'm very, very grateful to both of them not only for their support in the recent election but for their involvement in the great issues of this time. I've been working hard for the last 2 weeks to try to be worthy of the trust of the voters of this country who gave me a chance to become President, including the people of New Jersey who voted for a Democrat for the first time in 28 years. I know you haven't always been able to tell it from the news, but I spent virtually all of my time working on the economy, the jobs issues, the deficit, meeting in long periods with my staff, with people from around the country who know about these matters, with Members of the United States Congress, working with people in both parties to try to end the gridlock and to reach agreement so that we can move forward. We've had, as all of you know now, an economic upturn in the last few months, and we hope that we are coming out firmly of the longest recession we've had in a good long while. There is much to be encouraged about in two or three areas. First of all, interest rates have been down for a good long while now, and millions of Americans have refinanced their homes or been able to buy new homes in ways that have generated significant economic activity. Second, and even more encouraging over the long run, there has been a big increase in the productivity of American businesses and workplaces. That is, after all, the key to our economic future. And finally, beginning in December with a little bit in November, but a big increase in December in consumer confidence, which has strengthened the consumer market in our country, something we hope will carry through for the next few months. Still, there are clear challenges before us. With all these good numbers coming in, very few new jobs have been created in America yet in this recovery. Most big businesses that are doing better are still downsizing; it's a part of their productivity. That happened all during the 1980's, when in every year of the 1980's the Fortune 500 companies reduced employment in total by more than a quarter of a million in the United States. But throughout much of the eighties, that reduction was more than offset by the creation of jobs in the small business sector. In the last couple of years and regrettably even in the last few months, small business is not taking up the slack because of the crushing burden of health care costs and because of the credit crunch, which is much more severe in some States and regions than others but which is a very serious problem for our economy. We also have a deficit that next year is projected to be $50 billion bigger as of December than we were told in August and is growing exponentially, even though the Congressmen who are here can tell you that they made a good faith effort in 1990 to rein the deficit in with spending cuts and tax increases they thought would do it. It didn't happen because the taxes didn't bring in as much money as they thought, but even more importantly because health care costs have continued unabated, rising at breathtaking rates. So that at the end of this year&mdash;those of you who pay health insurance will know this&mdash;but we now, alone of all the advanced countries in the world, are spending 14 percent of our income on health care. No other country except Canada is over 9. That is a terrific competitive disadvantage. It is costing you a great deal of money not only as taxpayers, for what you pay for Government health care, but in the private sector. And the hemorrhage is such that about 100,000 Americans a month are now losing their health insurance, many of them finding their way onto the public rolls and leading to explosive increases in the Governments health care burden. So as we look ahead to our challenges and as I look ahead to this speech I have to give on February 17th to the joint session of Congress, I still believe in the fundamental themes on which I ran for President: We have to increase job growth and income growth without increasing inflation. We have to face the serious problems of our urban areas and the serious problems of the underclass in ways that liberate the ability of all people to perform at high levels in this economy if we want to continue the increase in productivity. That means that we have to shift away in the money that you give us to spend, away from consumption, more toward investment. We have to increase investment in new technologies and education and training, in infrastructure and the things that will grow this economy. It also means that we have to provide more incentives in our Tax Code for investment in the private sector. And it means we have to act at long last to bring health care costs in line with inflation. If we did that, it would do more to free up private sector dollars to invest in economic growth than any tax cut I could sign into law or any spending increase that Congress and I together can enact. So we will begin in earnest as soon as this break is over to do those things that your National Government has never had to do simultaneously before: We will attempt to increase investment and reduce the deficit at the same time. It will require an enormous amount of discipline and a willingness to try some new things and to cut some things in ways that we have not done before. I hope you will all wish us well, and I hope you will tell every Member of your congressional delegation up here, without regard to party, that you know they're going to have to cast some difficult votes in order for this country to face its problems, and if they do it in good conscience and explain to you why you did it, you will not hold it against them. That's what they were hired to do, and you'll stick with them if they can do it. You know, when I was Governor&mdash;and I did that job for a dozen years, and I had a good time doing it&mdash;there were many times when I had to cut spending five or six times in a given year. And people would be a little disconcerted at first, but we never got in debt. And I was always proud of the fact that my State had such a disciplined system. We paid a terrible price for it during the eighties when times were tough. But because we rode them out, last year we ranked first or second in job growth in virtually every month when I was off running for President, not because of anything that happened last year but because of the foundations that were laid in investments, in being competitive, and in fiscal integrity, in keeping those books balanced. Those are the kind of difficult decisions we're going to have to make now. Not so long ago, you elected a Governor who had to make some of those decisions. And let me say that, again without attempting to be too partisan, the truth is that if you live in a State, you don't get to print your own money. You can't get in the mess that your National Government is in because you can't run that long without having the brakes come on, without throwing people through the collective windshield that keeps us all in the same boat. And I have to tell you that for all the pain that the decisions made by Governor Florio and the legislature then caused him and them, the truth is that your house is in order now. New Jersey is going to have a balanced budget without a tax increase, and you even have a rainy day fund at a time when many States are going bankrupt. Sooner or later, we all have to face the music. And when we do, we are normally rewarded. So New Jersey is being rewarded. Look at your credit rating. Look at the overall health of the economy. Look at the trends in the State. I hope that together with the Senate and the House, with the Republicans and the Democrats in this great Capital of yours, we can come to grips with our problems in ways that the American people will understand and embrace, perhaps with less political fallout, but I hope in the end with the same sort of stability and success that you have achieved with Governor Florio. And I hope you're proud of it, because I am. Let me just mention one other thing. I happened to think of this&mdash;it really hadn't occurred to me, but I think I ought to mention it. I asked Governor Florio, through the Trade Ambassador, Mickey Kantor, to serve on our intergovernmental advisory committee, because there's so much relationship now between our national trade policies and the policies followed at the State and local level for growth. I think he'll do a good job on that, but I wanted to emphasize it because a big part of our economic strength is in our capacity to export. While our administration has found it necessary to take some pretty tough positions on trade issues in the last 2 weeks, I want to emphasize to you I do not take those positions in the hope of provoking a trade war or raising trade barriers in this country but only so that we can have expanded trade on fair terms for ourselves and for all nations. We cannot grow this economy, and no wealthy nation can grow, unless there is global economic growth. And I want to pledge to you that I will do my best to help all the world-class companies headquartered in New Jersey have an environment in which they can grow and flourish in the international economy, with a trade system that is constantly expanding, but expanding on terms that are genuinely fair not only to ourselves but to our trading partners as well. I ask you all without regard to your party to wish us well. And I ask you one more time to give the Members of Congress here a pat on the back at the end of the dinner tonight. We're going to have a very challenging few months ahead of us. But it is an exciting time, and it is a fabulous opportunity for us to put our house in order and to deal with these problems and to move this country ahead. We are now positioned better than we have been in more than a decade to reassert the leadership of the United States economically and politically in the world in a way that is very positive if we will ensure future growth, get job growth along with economic growth, and put our financial house in order. I think we can do it if all the American people, again without regard to party, agree generally on the goal. We will disagree on the details, but in the end we will come to the people's business with a resolution. That's what you need, and most importantly, it's what your children need. We cannot afford to permit the Government to go on out of control, leaving our children with a legacy of debt and diminished living standards, when we can do so much better now. I want to thank you for what you have done, all of you in the private sector, to restore America's productivity to the breathtaking rates we've seen in this last quarter. We're going to try to give you that kind of productivity in your National Government. Thank you very much. [At this point, the President was presented with a gift.] I just want to say, if I ever heard a chamber of commerce speech in my life, it was that. He said, This is a Parker pen; it's for your wife. It's the nicest one they make. And then he said, And this other one's for you. [At this point, the President was presented with a second gift.] Let me say, I wish she were here to thank her personally. But this is a gift for The White House, for the American people. And I hope a lot of you from New Jersey will see this when you come in and know that it is yours. We'll leave it there for all time from the people of New Jersey.Thank you.",clinton
"Today I am directing my administration to release $156 million to help low-income households throughout the Nation cope with substantial increases in home heating fuel costs. The significant and sustained rise in energy costs has posed a special burden on low-income families, in many cases forcing them to choose between food and other essentials or a bare minimum of heat in these winter months. Releasing these heating funds today will ease the burden on the Nation's low-income families by helping cover their higher home heating costs in the cold weeks and months to come.",clinton
"Mrs. Yandle, I never had a better introduction. Before we thank anyone else, I think all of us should acknowledge that it was America's families who have beaten the gridlock in Washington to pass family leave, people like this fine woman all over America who talked to Members of Congress, both Democrat and Republican, who laid their plight out, who asked that their voices be heard. When Senator Gore and I ran in the election last year, we published a book called Putting People First. I'm very proud that the first bill I am to sign as President truly puts people first. I do want to thank the United States Congress for moving expeditiously on this matter and for doing it before their first recess so that every Member of Congress who voted for this bill can go home and say, We are up there working on your problems and your promise, trying to make a better future for you. This sends a clearer signal than any words any of us could utter, that we have tried to give this Government back to the American people. And I am very appreciative that the Congress has moved so rapidly on this bill. There are many, many Members of Congress here and many others who are not here who played a major role in this legislation. Time does not permit me to mention them all, but I do want to thank the Senate majority leader for his heroic efforts in the 11th hour to make sure we passed this bill; Senator Kennedy and Senator Dodd for their passionate and years-long commitment to this effort. I want to thank the Speaker, Speaker Foley, and Congressman Ford, the chairman of the committee that had jurisdiction over this bill, and Congresswoman Pat Schroeder and all the other Democrats who worked on this bill. But I want to acknowledge, too, consistent with the promise I made in my Inaugural to reach out to members of both parties who would try to push for progress, that this bill also had passionate support among Republicans. My old colleague in the Governors' Association, Senator Kit Bond from Missouri, I thank you for your leadership. Senator Jeffords and Senator Coats I don't believe are here, but they supported this bill strongly; and Congresswoman Marge Roukema from New Jersey, her commitment on this was unwavering; Congresswoman Susan Molinari from New York and many other Republicans voted for, spoke for, and worked for this bill. I thank them, the subcommittee chairs who are here, and all the others who worked so hard to make this bill a real live promise kept for the Congress to the people of the United States. Family medical leave has always had the support of a majority of Americans, from every part of the country, from every walk of life, from both political parties. But some people opposed it. And they were powerful, and it took 8 years and two vetoes to make this legislation the law of the land. Now millions of our people will no longer have to choose between their jobs and their families. The law guarantees the right of up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave per year when it's urgently needed at home to care for a newborn child or an ill family member. This bill will strengthen our families, and I believe it will strengthen our businesses and our economy as well. I have spent an enormous amount of time in the last 12 years in the factories and businesses of this country talking to employers and employees, watching the way people work, often working with them. And I know that men and women are more productive when they are sure they won't lose their jobs because they're trying to be good parents, good children. Our businesses should not lose the services of these dedicated Americans. And over the long run, the lessons of the most productive companies in the world, here at home and around the world, are that those who put their people first are those who will triumph in the global economy. The business leaders who have already instituted family and medical leave understand this, and I'm very proud of some of the business leaders who are here today who represent not only themselves but others all across America who were ahead of all of us who make laws in doing what is right by our families. Family and medical leave is a matter of pure common sense and a matter of common decency. It will provide Americans what they need most: peace of mind. Never again will parents have to fear losing their jobs because of their families. Just a week ago, I spoke to 10 people in families who had experienced the kinds of problems Mrs. Yandle has talked about today. Vice President Gore and I talked to people all across America who moved us deeply. We were saddened to hear their stories, but today all of us can be happy to think of their future. Now that we have won this difficult battle, let me ask all of you to think about what we must do ahead to put the public interest ahead of special interest, to pass a budget which will grow this economy and shrink our deficit, and to go on about the business of putting families first. There's a lot more we need to do to help people trapped in welfare move to work and independence; to strengthen child support enforcement; to reward those who work 40 hours a week and have children at home with an increase in the earned-income tax credit so we can really say we're rewarding work instead of dependence; to immunize all the children of this country so more parents won't have to take advantage of family leave because their children will be well and strong and healthy. Let all of us who care about our families, our people, the strength of our economy, and the future of our Nation put our partisan and other interests aside and be inspired by this great victory today to have others when Congress returns to this city and we go on about the people's business.Thank you very much.",clinton
"Canada-U.S. Relations Good afternoon. I'm delighted that my first meeting as President with a foreign leader is with the Prime Minister of Canada, Brian Mulroney. On the day after I was elected, I spoke of the essential continuity of our country's foreign policy. Our steadfast relationship with Canada is an indispensable element of that continuity. Prime Minister Mulroney and the people of Canada should know that the United States is still their friend and their partner. It is worth noting that the United States and Canada share the world's longest undefended border and that we haven't had a battle between us since the War of 1812. Now having said that, Mr. Prime Minister, I will tell you that I look forward to winning back the World Series. Canada has long stood as our partner in promoting democracy and human fights around the world. Today Canada is demonstrating her international leadership for peace and freedom through her commitment of troops in peacekeeping efforts around the world, in Somalia, in Bosnia, and elsewhere. Canada is our largest trading partner. Both our nations benefit enormously from the immense river of goods and services flowing across our border, with an increase of $30 billion just since the free trade agreement went into effect. It is remarkable how relatively few disputes have attended the vigorous trading between us. Yet it is inevitable that there will be some disagreements even among close partners. And we agreed today to maintain high-level attention to that trading relationship, to ensure that the problems are addressed before they become crises. The Prime Minister and I discussed the North American Free Trade Agreement. I assured him that my administration intends to move forward with NAFTA while establishing a process to provide adequate protection to workers, to farmers, and to the environment. Canada was our partner in working with Mexico to negotiate NAFTA, and Canada will be our partner as we move forward to put it and its related agreements into effect. We've made a good start here today in setting the stage for working together. We also discussed the GATT agreement, and I reassured the Prime Minister that the United States will do what it can to secure an agreement at GATT that all the world can be proud of and can be a prosperous part of. We reviewed a broad range of global issues, including the developments in Russia and elsewhere in the former Soviet Union, the crisis in the Balkans, the situation in Somalia and Haiti. We also discussed our participation in the Group of Seven and what the United States and Canada might hope to achieve this year, and especially this summer when the G-7 meets in Tokyo, to help move the global economy out of recession and into a strong recovery. This was a very good beginning. I want to thank Prime Minister Mulroney for coming down from Canada and tell him that he'll always be welcome here. And I look forward to visiting you on your home turf soon. Prime Minister Mulroney. Thank you, Mr. President. I'll simply say that, as the President indicated, we had a very full review of quite a large number of items in the few hours we spent together and a very productive working lunch. I thought it was a very good meeting and a very good beginning of the relationship of Canada with the new administration. The President has indicated the complex issues that we've touched on, tried to deal with, principally, of course, and I think you'll understand, the relationship between Canada and the United States itself. The relationship is by far the most important one the United States has in the world. This is the biggest trading relationship ever between two nations. And at the end of the year the important thing is it tends to be in rough balance, which indicates that you can have free trade and prosper. And so we're very concerned about the GATT, and we're very concerned about trading currents generally and very reassured by the President's strong commitments and strong positions in respect of the manner in which you bring back and reenergize prosperity around the world. So we covered our bilateral arrangements, and we covered a lot of the hot spots around the world. And I'm sure that the President and I would be happy to take a few questions. [At this point, the Prime Minister repeated his statement in French.] Thank you very much, Mr. President. NAFTA # Mr. Prime Minister, what do you think of the changes the President wants to make in the NAFTA agreement? Prime Minister Mulroney. Well, Helen [Helen Thomas, United Press International], the changes that the&mdash;the President doesn't&mdash;he indicated-he will, himself, I'm sure, but the President has indicated many times that he is going to sign the NAFTA agreement as it is but that he proposes to bring in supplemental agreements with Mexico, particularly in regard to some of the points that he has mentioned, that do not impact on the NAFTA agreement as concluded. That may change. If it does, I'm sure we'll hear from the President. But our information is that, by and large, that the NAFTA agreement with those supplemental accords is something that he could promote and defend very vigorously.I think, Mr. President, that's the position. That's right. And I might add that the Prime Minister's administration in Canada has had a strong record on the environment, something that we want to try to beef up in a supplemental agreement, and that Canada would be, I think, more or less in line with the United States in terms of its impact on any supplemental labor accord we might reach. So we certainly intend to work with them. After all, this is a three-way agreement, not a two-way agreement. But I still believe, as I said many weeks ago, that we can negotiate these agreements without reopening the NAFTA itself. Bosnia # [Inaudible]&mdash;the best way to proceed is to attempt to modify the U.N. plan? And how long do you think that negotiations can be relied on before stronger action is taken? Perhaps the best way to answer your question would be to let the Prime Minister communicate his views, which he communicated to me, and then let me tell you what my response is. Shall we do that? Prime Minister Mulroney. In regard to the Bosnian situation, we think, Susan [Susan Spencer, CBS News], that the elements of an agreement-there's been a lot of constructive work done, but that there are inadequacies in it that can be corrected at the Security Council by the involvement, a greater degree of involvement by the United States in terms of the accord itself and also the involvement of President Yeltsin. We believe that the elements of an agreement, impacted by the concern of the United States and Canada in the area of human rights, in the area of war crimes, for example, can be&mdash;these amendments can be of significant substance without altering a lot of the hard and constructive work that has taken place so far by Cy Vance and David Owen. But it would be important that in this process at the Security Council there be greater involvement by Russia and by President Yeltsin. And I took the liberty of making some recommendations along those lines to the President, and he'll reflect upon them and probably have something to say. Let me answer now to just reaffirm what our present posture is. We have given the Bosnian situation urgent consideration. We have reviewed a wide range of options. We certainly will take into account what the Prime Minister has said. Our reluctance on the Vance-Owen proposals, while I applaud the effort both personally and as President, is that the United States at the present time is reluctant to impose an agreement on the parties to which they do not agree, especially when the Bosnian Muslims might be left at a severe disadvantage if the agreement is not undertaken in good faith by the other parties and cannot be enforced externally. So we are looking at that. I think one of the things the Prime Minister said is absolutely right: If there is to be a diplomatic political solution to this over the long run, we very much need President Yeltsin involved and the support of Russia. He reaffirmed to me just a few days ago in our telephone conversation his general support for the policy that we have outlined. But I'm sure you can understand why with a problem this difficult, we would like a few days longer just to seriously review this to come up with what our policy is going to be. Then we'll announce it as clearly and forcefully and follow it as strongly as we possibly can. Haiti # [Inaudible]&mdash;is it time to strengthen pressure on Haiti? Do think we should have stronger action&mdash;[At this point, a question was asked and answered in French, and a translation was not provided.] # Mr. President, the same question, please.As the Prime Minister has said, our Secretary of State met today with President Aristide and discussed a wide range of issues with him as well as what our efforts have been, the progress and the lack of progress of Mr. Caputo's efforts. We talked about where we're going with this relationship in the figure. Let me say that I am committed to restoring democracy to Haiti. I am doing my best to work through the U.N. and the OAS with Mr. Caputo. I am, frankly, disappointed that the Prime Minister in Haiti has apparently backed off a little bit of his original willingness to let us send in some third-party observers, not just to protect the petitions for refugee status but also to try to stabilize conditions leading toward a restoration of democracy there. And we're going to talk to Mr. Caputo, see where he thinks things are, and then reassess our position. But I share the Prime Minister's determination. The United States and Canada should be and are one in our commitment to restoring democracy to Haiti. And we will continue to push ahead either on the course we're now on, or if that fails, on a more vigorous course toward that end. Israel # What did you tell the President on the deportees in Israel? Prime Minister Mulroney. We touched peripherally on the Middle East because the Secretary of State is going to, I gather, to the Middle East at an early moment. The position of Canada, my own view is that we tend not to try and give Israel lessons in regard to the determinations it has to make about its own national security. Israel's entitled to make some important value judgments about itself. That being said, I congratulated the President and the Secretary of State for their leadership in bringing about the first step of the return of the hundred deportees, which I think was an excellent example of diplomacy and international leadership by the President. It's the first step. It's not the whole answer. And it's a complicated matter which I think will be resolved&mdash;where the resolution of which will be clearer after Secretary of State Christopher has had an opportunity to visit the region. But I think that we're supportive of the U.N. resolutions, but I'm always very concerned when people start to lecture Israel on the manner in which it has to look after its own internal security, because for very important historical reasons, Israel, of course, is better qualified than most to make determinations about its own well-being. Bosnia # Mr. President, on Bosnia, do you expect that there would be an American diplomatic initiative to replace what you see as the flaws in the Vance-Owen initiative? I can't say that at this time. As I say, I applaud the efforts that have been made by Lord Owen and by Secretary Vance. I think that they have done the very best they could. And I don't criticize the details so much as&mdash;it's not a criticism so much as a reluctance on the part of the United States to impose on parties an agreement which they do not freely accept themselves, particularly one that might work to the immediate and to the long-term further disadvantage of the Bosnian Muslims. But I would not rule out any option at this time. We have a wide range of options under consideration. We are working very hard on this. We will settle on a course and then do our best to consult with our allies and win broad support for it. You heard the Prime Minister say that over the long run we need President Yeltsin's involvement in this, and I agree. You heard me say that we hardly ever do anything in foreign policy that we don't have Canada's support in, and we'll need that. So we've got a lot of work to do on this. We've been working very hard and we'll try to bring it to a quick closure. # There seems to be disagreement, though, in that the Prime Minister seems to think that that can be built upon&mdash; # &mdash;come up with some agreement. I hope we can revive them. Our biggest problem in this country is the expiration of fast track authority. But we have begun a lot of talks in earnest within the administration about that. I've done my best to send a signal to our trading partners and to the parties to GATT that we very much want a successful agreement. And I'll have more to say about that in the days ahead.Thank you. Haiti [At this point, a question was asked and answered in French, and a translation was not provided.] Let me answer that also. I take it by what I believe was your French, of what then was a good translation I got, that you mean by complexity of the situation in Haiti the fact that Father Aristide was plainly elected by an overwhelming majority and is plainly still&mdash;has the support of an overwhelming majority of the people; but while, in the brief period when he was in authority, made some statements which caused people in the military and others to have fear for their security, their personal security, in ways that are inconsistent with running a democracy, which has to recognize human rights&mdash;does that present the complexity? Yes, that is the nub of the issue. We have to be able to restore democracy in a way that convinces everybody that their human rights will be respected and, for an interim period, protected. And obviously, that's what the Caputo mission is designed to do. But the complexity of the issue cannot deter us from the fundamental mission, which is to restore a democratically elected government that will not abuse the human rights of ordinary Haitians. And I agree with the Prime Minister, we certainly ought to be able to do that here in our backyard, and we're going to work hard on it.Thank you very much. Prime Minister Mulroney. Thank you very much.",clinton
"Let me say, first of all, welcome to the White House. Mayor Jackson, I saw your brother earlier today at the signing of the Family and Medical Leave Act, and he was bragging on you, said you're now as thin as he is. I assured him I would still be able to recognize you when I saw you. This has been a wonderful day here at the White House. Congress adjourned&mdash; -but only after passing the Family and Medical Leave Act. We had a great signing this morning. It was a great bipartisan effort; about a third of the Republicans in the Senate voted for it. And it was a really good, good way to start the day. I'm glad you're here. I know you've been meeting with Secretary Cisneros, who's one of your own. There are times when we meet when I can't tell whether he's changed positions or not&mdash; which I suppose from your point of view is a good thing. Most of you in this room I know well. I've spent a lot of time in your communities, and you have played a major role in my political education. I assure you that I think every day about many of the places we've been and the things we've seen and the things that I have learned from you. I think that the time I spent in our country's cities in this last election, that was in many ways the most instructive time that I spent. And one of the things that impressed me so much is that so many things, against all the odds, are being done that work. And I want you to help me now figure out how to make those things that work the rule rather than the exception in American life. I told the Governors when they came in here and spent some time with me earlier this week on the subject of health care that if somebody asked me to name my greatest failing as a Governor after 12 years, it was that I never could quite figure out a way to make the exception the rule, to take those things that worked and make them work everywhere. In that connection, I have been working with Secretary Cisneros and have sent, after working it out with him, a directive to him today to deal with a number of specific things that I know are important to all of you: First, to establish a weekly mechanism for communication with the State and local leaders of our country on issues of housing and urban development. And I hope we'll have a chance to talk about both of them because they are related, but they aren't the same. Second, to try to expedite the programs that are already there now, to unclog some $6 billion that have been inexplicably tied up in the pipeline of the Federal Government that have already been appropriated; to speed up by 3 to 4 months the processing of the over $3 billion in public housing funds that are available and to try to accelerate the real implementation of the HOME Program where there's $2.5 billion in largely unmoved funds because the administrative system of this Department has been largely paralyzed. I told Henry when I asked him to take this position that there was some risk because of the pall which had been cast over HUD and the problems of past years and because there had been a lot of rhetoric but not enough action out of the Department in recent years. We're going to do what we can to marry rhetoric and action. We don't promise to shut up, but we promise to try to do some things. I also want to tell you that I'm going to do the best I can in this upcoming stimulus and economic package to do what I said I would do: to bring down the deficit but to increase investment at the same time in ways that will make available more funds for the cities. I remember, Mayor White, when we were in Cleveland with Congressman Stokes, you said you thought we ought to increase the community development block grant funds because you could move those more quickly to create jobs. And there will be a fairly sizable increase in that in the proposed stimulus package to try to help you create jobs. Let me just make a couple of general remarks about where we are on this whole economic approach, and then I'd like to hear from you, and I'd like to just be as informal and conversational as possible. The economic news is good but mixed and incomplete. That is, starting in the last quarter we have begun to have two pieces of good economic news. One is that productivity is increasing, and that's good. Companies are making more money. They're figuring out how to compete in a tough international environment. Two is that there's a lot more economic activity around housing as low interest rates finally are letting millions of Americans refinance their home mortgages, others get into buying homes, and that's all been good. Then since the election, there have been two good pieces of economic news that I think the election can fairly claim some credit for. One is that consumer confidence started going up in November and exploded in December, and it's going to be strong in January. The second is that the financial markets generally are upbeat about the direction that our administration has outlined, which means they take us seriously that we're going to try to do what many say is impossible, which is to increase investment and reduce the debt at the same time. So, that's the good news. The bad news is that in this economy, the downsizing of big firms is continuing apace. It started in the 1980's, when every year of the 1980's the Fortune 500 together reduced employment in the United States by about 400,000 people per year, big, big reductions in employment. In most years, that was offset by job increases in small and medium-sized companies. Now that is not happening, even though this recovery is in place. So you have this strange thing where the economic indicators are going up in the last quarter like crazy, but the unemployment rate is higher than it was at the depth of the recession. And for 14 months we've had a national unemployment rate over 7 percent. Why is that? I think there are several reasons, but let me just say there are plainly three. One is that small business cannot afford to hire new workers and make up the slack from big business cuts because of the exploding costs of health care. Two is that the small businesses that want to hire workers can't get credit because of the credit crunch, which is more heavily concentrated in some places than others and particularly in California and southern Florida-Mayor Lanier, still in Texas&mdash;but generally across the country. The third is that the defense cutbacks have accelerated the loss of high-wage manufacturing jobs without any offsetting industrial strategy or conversion strategy in America, which has been particularly devastating for southern California, for Connecticut, and for one or two other places, but has been generally felt across the country. So the first thing I've got to try to figure out how to do is how to keep this economic recovery with all these big numbers going but to actually help real people out of it. How are we going to generate some more jobs? One way is to put some more money into basic construction, which would affect you. We're going to try to accelerate the funding of ISTEA, which would help you. We're going to try to put some money into this stimulus package. It will be modest because we don't want to be accused of ignoring the economic indicators, but it will be substantial to several areas. And the other is to outline a 5-year investment plan which will increase our investment in infrastructure, which will have a defense conversion plan, and which will attempt to address these very serious problems that are killing small business, namely controlling health costs and providing basic health care to all Americans and trying to break open the credit crunch. If you think about it, two best things I could do for you are both indirect. If we could bring health costs in line with inflation and get banks to lending again, economic activity would pick up among people who would then pay taxes to your local government, and you could take that money and do what you need to do. The best thing I could do for the private sector, if we could bring health costs in line with inflation between now and the year 2000, we would save the private sector 2 1/2 times as much as the public purse, freeing hundreds of billions of dollars a year to be reinvested in the economies of this country. So, what I'm going to try to do is just that. It's never been done before in this country, having to bring down the deficit and increase investment at the same time. It's going to require some very tough choices. I spent 2 hours yesterday trying to cut the budget in areas that I thought were inessential in order to free up monies that would be invested. And obviously most of our investment money goes directly back to State and local government. I'm sure that a lot of you will wish we were spending more. But let me say that it is critical, I'm convinced, that we show some discipline in bringing down this deficit, because every point we drop long-term interest rates frees up $50 billion for new investment in this economy. So I'm going to try to spend more in terms of investment and reduce the deficit, which means I'm going to have to cut consumption even more. And we're working on it. And I hope that we can work together closely, and we can do a very good job together. One of the things that I've been impressed with&mdash;Secretary Cisneros' work over at the Department-is he came back saying what a lot of our Secretaries have said. He said, This thing's not working very well when we've got all this money out there that's not even being spent. We've got $6 billion in the pipeline. We got $3.1 billion that's been approved that's going to take 4 months too long to get out there. We've got this HOME Program; nobody can access the money because of the administrative problems. So, we can keep you busy for a year or so if we just run the Department right. And we're going to do our best to do that.I think the floor is now yours. Thank you.",clinton
"Dear Mr. Chairman: In accordance with section 490(h) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (FAA), I am submitting a list of countries which, as of January 1, 1993, have been determined to be major illicit drug producing and drug transit countries. These countries have been selected on the basis of information from the March 1, 1992, International Narcotics Control Strategy Report (INCSR) and from other U.S. Government sources. The list of countries is identical to the one submitted by the Secretary of State on October 1, 1992, pursuant to the provisions of section 481(k)(3) (now repealed) of the FAA and using the definition of a major illicit drug producing country and a major drug transit country given in sections 481(i) (2) and (5) of the same law. The International Narcotics Control Act of 1992 (INCA) amended the FAA on November 2, 1992, by changing the reporting date to January 1, 1993, and by suspending the sections 481(i) (2) and (5) definitions for fiscal years 1993 and 1994. In fiscal year 1995 the section 481(i) definitions will again apply. Since the section 481(i) definitions, however, have provided a generally sound and' consistent basis for classifying major drug producing and transit countries, we will continue to use them with some practical adjustments to take into account more accurate measurement techniques and the effect on the illicit U.S. drug market. We will not add or remove countries to or from the major drug producers list until we have our own confirmation that conditions in the country so warrant. We expect to revise the list during 1993 based on information in the next International Narcotics Control Strategy Report and survey information. At this time, there are reports that there may be significant illicit cultivation of opium poppies in Vietnam and in the former Soviet Central Asian republics. When we complete the relevant surveys of these countries, we will decide whether the data justify their inclusion on the list. The following countries are subject to certification on narcotics cooperation: The Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Jamaica, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Venezuela, Afghanistan, India, Iran, Lebanon, Morocco, Nigeria, Pakistan, Syria, Burma, China, Hong Kong, Laos, Malaysia, and Thailand.Sincerely, BILL CLINTON",clinton
"Good morning. I want to make a statement this morning and then turn the microphone over to the Vice President to discuss the environmental issues. And then he will take questions on the matter. Today I am announcing the creation of a White House Office on Environmental Policy, keeping a commitment that both the Vice President and I made to the American people to bring new leadership and new energy to these issues. And I am today reinforcing my intention to work with the Congress for legislation that will make the Environmental Protection Agency a part of my Cabinet. We face urgent environmental and economic challenges that demand a new way of thinking and a new way of organizing our efforts here in the White House and in the National Government. This Office represents in action our commitment to confront these challenges in a new, more effective way, recognizing the connection between environmental protection and economic growth and our responsibility to provide real leadership on global environmental issues. We must move in a new direction to recognize that protecting the environment means strengthening the economy and creating new jobs for Americans. And we must be ready to take advantage of the absolutely enormous business opportunities that exist both here and around the world for new environmental technologies that protect the environment and increase business profits and jobs. The days of photo-op environmentalism are over. The Competitiveness Council is closed and so is the back door the polluters used to be able to use to get out from under our laws. This Office represents our commitment to the environment and to a new, more efficient and effective way to craft policies that work, policies that recognize that protecting the environment, strengthening the economy, promoting the global environment, and dealing with global environmental problems have all too often been relegated to the bottom of the agenda. These are policies that will renew for the American people a genuine commitment to their health, their safety, and their jobs. This Office will be responsible for coordinating environmental policy. The Director of the Office will participate in the National Security Council, the National Economic Council, and the Domestic Policy Council and will work with all the relevant agencies. I am pleased to announce today that Kathleen McGinty will lead this Office and its efforts. We are today changing the way Government works, replacing the Council on Environmental Quality with a new office that will have broader influence and a more effective and focused mandate to coordinate environmental policy. The American people look to us to make Government work better and more efficiently and more effectively for them. We are taking an important step in that direction today. The American people, our economy, and our environment will benefit as a result of this. And I'd like to say a special word of thanks to Vice President Gore for the work that he has done on this since the election. We have been working hard now for more than 2 months to determine exactly how we ought to reorganize our environmental efforts and how we could integrate the environment, for the first time really, into national security policy, national economic policy, and other domestic policies. I think we've taken a long step in that direction. I thank the Vice President for his leadership, and I turn the microphone over to him.",clinton
"Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to sign these Executive orders, and then I will go over to the microphone and make a statement about each one. The first order requires by attrition a reduction in Federal positions of 100,000. The second order is a reduction in the administrative costs of the present Federal Government by 3 percent per year on average leading up to 5 percent in the 4th year of this 4-year term and abolishing several boards and commissions. The third order deals with the commissions. These are memoranda to the Department heads. One deals with perks; one deals with Government vehicles; one deals with aircraft. [At this point, the President signed the documents.] Members of the Cabinet and staff, tonight I will be going to Michigan and the Vice President will be going to California to hold town meetings with American citizens to talk to them about the economic problems and the budget mess that we have inherited and the priorities and principles we intend to bring to our efforts to change the country and bring about recovery. The people demand and deserve an active Government on their side. But they don't want a Government that wastes money, a Government that costs more and does less. They voted for change. They wanted a literal revolution in the way Government operates, and now you and I must deliver. Yesterday I announced the reorganization of the White House staff that will reduce our staff by 25 percent and cut costs by $10 million per year. Today I have called you, the Members of the Cabinet, together to take the next step, to begin the overhaul of Government as a whole. The steps we're taking today will save the American taxpayer $9 billion. They won't be easy, but they will make a difference. We have an obligation and an opportunity to change the way Government works and to show that Government can do more with less. Our Government needs change. For the last dozen years I've heard our leaders call loudly for less Government while giving people more Government and, perhaps more importantly, while giving almost no attention to better or different Government, to new ways in which partnerships could be made with people in the private sector and in State and local governments. Too often in the last decade people have rushed to defend the power of the few at the top and privileges of the elite, not just in the private sector but also in Government. Too often when economic security of ordinary Americans has been threatened, Government has sat still, refused to lead; not even follow, just get in the way. That era has come to an end with our coming to office. Today the Cabinet and I are taking several steps to show that we intend to change the way that Government works. But I want to make it clear this is only a beginning, not the end of the process. First, I am ordering a reduction of the Federal bureaucracy by at least 100,000 positions over the next 4 years. At least 10 percent of these cuts must come from senior management. The cuts can come from attrition; I see no need for layoffs. These cuts will make our Government more efficient and more effective. The Government is full of dedicated people whose hard work is being choked off by our own bureaucracy. Second, I'm ordering each Federal department and agency to reduce its administrative, as opposed to its program, costs by 12 percent over the next 4 years. With better planning and innovation we can make better use of the money we already have. In many agencies overhead is too high, red tape is too thick, and the day-to-day operations of the agencies have not been reexamined in a very long time. I believe Government can both care about people and be careful with their money. Third, I am today ordering the elimination of hundreds of unproductive and duplicative advisory commissions that have spread across this Government like kudzu. I'm asking the Office of Management and Budget to eliminate at least one-third of the 700 advisory boards and commissions that were not created by Congress. From now on agencies and departments will not be allowed to create new commissions without permission from OMB. We simply cannot allow the Federal bureaucracy to beget more bureaucracy. Finally, we have to shrink the gulf between Government and the average citizen. Too often success in Washington is measured not by results but by perks. Today I've issued three directives that will begin to limit perks and privileges that have driven a wedge between Washington and the public: First, an end to widespread use of home-to-office limousines by top officials and a reduction in the limousine fleets overall by half. Second, I'm tightening the rules for using Government airplanes and ordering an inventory of the airplane fleet with an eye toward eliminating unnecessary planes. Many people believe that there are substantial savings here. Finally, I'm ordering the elimination of such perks as below-cost executive dining rooms and free membership in private health clubs. However, I do want to say to you, as I just told the Cabinet before we came in, this administration was also elected to provide a health care plan for the American people, including setting a good example. And one of the ways I want to do that is to keep people healthier. So, I will also encourage every Government agency to provide health facilities in any building of any size, as long as they are provided on equal terms to all employees from the building maintenance people to the Secretary of the Department. These Executive orders are just a beginning, but they're a good beginning. We will now move on to really try to find ways to reinvent the way Government works and relates to people: how we can empower people more and entitle them less, how we can have more effective partnerships with the private sector and with State and local government, how we can find some of the dramatic productivity innovations that have characterized our finest companies over the last few years. I'd like to now call upon a few of our Cabinet Secretaries to discuss some of the things that they have been doing in their agencies, beginning with the Labor Secretary, Secretary Reich. [At this point, Secretary Reich discussed how eliminating executive perks improves management-labor relations.] Secretary O'Leary. [Secretary O'Leary discussed the example set by staff reductions in her own office.] I also appreciate what you've done to make the building more accessible over there.Secretary O'Leary. Thank you.Secretary Cisneros. [Secretary Cisneros discussed HUD cost-cutting measures and management improvement efforts.] Secretary Babbitt. [Secretary Babbitt discussed Interior Department management improvement and elimination of perks.] Well, thank you. One of us has had a big problem to deal with in the last few days, and my impression is that he's done quite well. I'd like to ask Secretary Espy just to give a report about the crisis he's been dealing with and what his recommendation has been. [Secretary Espy discussed plans for improvement of the meat inspection program in response to reported cases of E. coli bacterial contamination.] Anybody else like to be heard? Bosnia # Mr. President, changing the subject, since Secretary Christopher is going to talk about Bosnia this afternoon, could you at least tell us are U.S. troops a part of the initiative that will be unveiled this afternoon? I think I should let Secretary Christopher give his speech first. We have all worked very hard on this Bosnia policy ever since we took office and even before, trying to find a way to do more but do it with the support of our allies and through the United Nations. I think I'll let him give his speech, and then I'll be glad to answer questions about the policies after he does. # Do you think the public I think the public will support the policy that he will outline today, yes. I think they will want us to do more and want us to do it in a prudent way. And I think that they will support this policy.",clinton
"Thank you very, very much. Thank you for coming out on this cold day to make me feel warmly welcome to Michigan. I want to say how grateful I am to be back here again. This is my first trip out of the Nation's Capital as your President. The first time I've ever been on Air Force One, I flew here to Michigan. I want to say a word of thanks to Chairman Dingell and your wonderful Congressman from this district, David Bonior, and all the Members of Congress who are here, and Senator Levin and Senator Riegle. I want to thank my good friend Governor Blanchard, who flew here with me from Washington. I want to thank all of you who are here, and I'd like to say a special word of thanks to the men and women in uniform who are here in this crowd who serve our Nation every day. I know you're grateful to them. I want to thank the people of Michigan, without whom I might well not be here as President today, for your support in November and your support in March, and, more importantly, maybe, for all the things that I learned here in Michigan. When I was a boy, the first thing I ever knew about Michigan, growing up in Arkansas, was it was sort of the land of opportunity for our people who couldn't make a living on the farm anymore. They came here and became middle class citizens by working in the auto plants or by other industries that were successful. When I came here as a candidate for President, I didn't know whether I could do very well. And after I came home the first time, I called my wife. I said, Every other person I met was from Arkansas; we're going to do all right up here. People came here because Michigan was the American dream. When I came back to Michigan in this Presidential campaign I found a different picture, not all bad by any means but much more mixed. I saw in Michigan people who were developing new industries and new technologies and new hope for the future. I saw people working together across racial lines. But I also saw industries dying on the vine and people who had worked all their lives losing jobs and losing their health care. And I saw people divided by race, too. I saw everything about America writ large here in this State: all that is best, all that is most troubling. But I saw an awful lot of hope, too. Today when I left the White House to come here, we had a crowd of folks come out on the lawn to say goodbye, and when I knew that we'd bring in some folks just from the public who were there and some people who work in The White House, many of whom had never met the President before. And I had so many people who work in correspondence who were telling me that the letters are coming in at record rates here, massive numbers of letters for me, for my wife, for my daughter, people writing us about their hopes, their dreams, their new ideas. I'm going to do a town hall meeting tonight, a televised meeting connecting four cities, not just Detroit but three others, too, and all across the country. You know, between June and November I did nine of those. But I started a year ago in New Hampshire doing them, because I believe that people like me shouldn't hide from the people who elected them. I think we ought to be accountable. There will be many difficult and challenging days ahead. But if you'll stay in touch with me, if you'll let me hear the truth of your feelings and your ideas, when you agree and when you disagree, I think we can change this country. And if you will give courage to your elected officials and tell them that that's what you voted for, for a change, that as difficult as it may be to change, staying where we are is the most expensive course of all, we can do it. You know, shortly after you elected me to President, I was given my first piece of good news and my first piece of bad news. The good news was that consumer confidence was up and people were feeling better and people thought we could change the economy; that American companies, in a tough global environment, were becoming more productive; that interest rates had come down some and people were financing their home loans. The bad news was that no new jobs were being created in our economy and that incomes were not going up and that after the election it was announced that the Government deficit was going to be $50 billion higher next year and just about that high every year thereafter during my term of office. And so I had to go back to the drawing board and figure out how we were going to put the American people first, take on the special interests, invest in jobs and incomes and deal with the health care crisis and still bring the deficit down, as I promised to do, and to do it in a way that is fair to the middle class, people who've worked hard and paid the bills for 12 years. It isn't easy, I'll tell you that. But I'm doing my best. We have spent literally hours and hours and hours, the administration people and I, and I've met with large numbers of people in Congress, many people many times, since I became President just 3 weeks ago, doing almost nothing but focusing on this economy. And I am telling you I am confident that if we'll make some challenging decisions now and put this country on the right path, we can lift this economy up, we can create jobs, we can deal with the health care crisis and have a bright future. But remember: Everywhere I went in this election I said, Do not vote for me if you're going to quit on election day. Do not come to the Inaugural and celebrate the victory unless you're going to help us make the victory good. I need your help. I didn't see a single soul all those thousands of miles I traveled on those buses, stopping on the country roads and going to the big cities, I never did see a person holding up a sign saying, Everything's just fine. Leave well enough alone. Not the first sign. Even the people who honestly disagreed with me on a whole range of issues never said they believed that we didn't have to have the courage to change. And so tonight I ask you, watch what we do closely. If you think I'm wrong, call or write and tell me. But continue to support me with your prayers and your voice and your conviction, and give the Members of Congress the courage to change. That is what the election was all about. And we are going to try to make good on it.Thank you, and God bless you all.",clinton
"Thank you very much. I would like to thank all of you ladies and gentlemen for coming here to join me today. I would like to say a special word of thanks to the leaders of various organizations and sectors of our economy who came in a little earlier for a briefing. And thanks to the members of the administration who are here, who have been working so hard for the last 3 weeks on our economic program, and to the Vice President who went all the way to California last night to do a town meeting and came in about 5 o'clock this morning. He's the only person here who's had less sleep than I have. That's what Vice Presidents are for. I have asked you to come here today because we have to meet a challenge together. Many of you have been my friends for some time, and you have worked with me in this campaign and in others. Many of you are members of the other party who love your country and care very deeply about the health of our economy. It doesn't matter. If you look at the history of our country, whenever the chips have been down, the private sector, the business community has rallied to help America meet its challenges in war and in peace. In two World Wars, business men and women were among the leaders in our great national mobilizations, putting aside narrow interests for the national interest. When our Nation faced challenges from civil rights to the energy crisis, businesses have taken the lead in coping with change. Americans are at their best answering alarm bells in the night. But I think every one of you know that today we face a crisis which, while quieter, is every bit as profound as those we have faced in our past. We risk losing the standard of living that we have taken for granted for so many years as Americans. Too many middle class Americans have already suffered through a decade or more of declining real wages and rising basic costs. Now, even though it is said we are in a recovery and the overall economic indicators are quite impressive, the job creation that normally accompanies a recovery is not in evidence. Small businesses are having trouble creating jobs because of the lack of the availability of credit or because of the costs of health care. Big businesses are continuing to restructure, not just manufacturing businesses now but service organizations, too, because of the demands of the global economy. Business people have to deal with the realities they face, and they often make annual plans and 5-year forecasts, based on the best numbers they can get. Your Government for the last several years has either not been making annual plans or 5-year forecasts, or they've been based on numbers which aren't real and plans which were never intended to be carried out. Early in my campaign for President I did what I had always done when running for Governor: I put out a plan which, as nearly as I could, set forth what I thought we ought to do as a country to increase jobs and incomes, to reduce the national debt, to restore the health of our economy, and to deal with the long-term problems we face. I wanted to increase investment, reduce consumption, restore fairness to the Tax Code and growth to the incomes of America, deal with the structural problems of this economy like health care and the credit crunch, and to do it in a context that would enable us to have long-term health by reducing the national debt considerably. I did it last year based on the numbers that were then available. I revised the plan again in late spring. In August the Government said that the deficit was going to be bigger than we had anticipated. Then, still, I thought we could do essentially what we had outlined. But after the election, the Government revised the deficit figures upward again, this time by as much as $50 billion per year in each of the next 4 years. Now I have a choice. I can do what has been done by people in both parties for the last several years and has certainly been done by administrations unwilling to give up the rhetoric of low taxes and less Government, even though costs were exploding: I can sort of deny the problem and finesse the numbers. Or I can tell you what I think is the truth. I think I should follow the latter course. I believe that given the size of this deficit, given the burden it will put on today and tomorrow in terms of higher interest rates, given the fact that we also have a plain investment deficit in the education and training of our people and the investment in our infrastructure and those things that are critical to building high-wage, high-growth jobs, we have to take even more dramatic action than I had previously thought to increase investment for jobs and incomes, restrain unnecessary Government spending, raise revenues in a fair way, and reduce the national debt so we can have long-term growth. I think if we do not do these things, we will pay for it. I think the cost of the status quo is far, far higher than facing our problems and moving forward. Business people have known for years that something had to be done about our deficit. The national debt has quadrupled since 1980. Even more disturbing, unless present trends are altered, the debt on an annual basis will explode in the years ahead with 50 percent of it coming from increases in health care costs. I want to reduce this deficit, not as an end in itself but because I think it is a critical part of a strategy to build jobs and growth for America today and over the long run. In order to do that, I need your support and your contribution. Everyone will have to pay their fair share. But if you do, we will all be better off, and the business community will be stronger in the years ahead. Government has an obligation to provide the proper environment in which business can prosper, but the private sector drives the economy. If interest rates are too high, if the financial system is in disarray, if health care costs are crushing out discretionary income which can be put into new plant and equipment or hiring additional workers, the environment in which we operate will be crippled because the private sector cannot work. I want to be a better partner than that to you so that you can do your job. Productivity has gone up at an astonishing rate in many sectors of the American economy in the 1980's and in the early nineties. This recovery, indeed, that we now see underway seems to be based on three things: home mortgages going down enough for people to refinance their homes and buy new homes; consumer confidence coming up since the election&mdash;I hope I can keep it up; but most important, dramatic increases in productivity in the private sector. Those productivity increases are not yet manifest in more jobs for the American people or higher incomes, and they won't be until we do something about health care, about the deficit, and about doing the things it takes to make our country as a whole competitive over the long run. That is what I am trying to grapple with as your President, and what I need your support beginning next Wednesday in the Congress with, so that we can make progress on these great issues. If we don't reform our economic policies, I'm convinced eventually we will fall further and further behind. Ten years from now we won't even recognize the country that we all grew up in. Ten years from now, if we don't change present policies, the following things will happen: The deficit will be $653 billion in a given year. The national debt will be 78 percent of our gross domestic product. Health care costs will take up almost 20 percent of GDP. They are at 14 percent today. Only one other advanced nation in the entire world, Canada, is above 9, and they're just a little bit above 9 today. Medicare and Medicaid costs will triple for taxpayers and people less able to bear the burden. We have got to change. The short-term pain of making changes now is so much less than the long-term cost of continuing to do things the way we're doing them. So next week I will try to propose an economic package that will give the American people fundamental change. A goal is an economy that faces the world without fear and not only meets but beats our rivals in economic competition around the world; an economy that is growing, that provides jobs to everyone willing and able to work, that does not rest until the great American middle class that built this country once again feels that people who work hard and play by the rules will be rewarded and not punished. The broad outlines of this plan are no secret, but I'd like to restate them. First, to ensure that we do not lose the momentum and the new confidence that we have seen among consumers and in the markets and to finally get sustainable job growth, I believe strongly that we need an investment-led jobs package. But all of us here know that our problems go beyond the business cycle. More importantly, we need a long-term plan to increase investment in the American people and their future. We will put in place a program of investment in the physical infrastructure that is a precondition for prosperity and productivity. Finally, we will reduce our deficit, not as an end in itself, as I said, but as a means to achieve higher incomes and more jobs. This will require tough choices from all Americans. And before I turn to the middle class for help I have to turn to people who did well in the last decade. This past week we began with the Government, where we ought to begin, setting our own house in order. Too often in recent years our Government has been on automatic pilot. And believe me, it's been a very long time since the kind of searching reexamination of the mission of Government has been undertaken that you do all the time, that you do just to survive. And so we are beginning a process of literally trying to reinvent your National Government so that we can increase its productivity, its effectiveness, and its ability to be a partner with you in the great enterprise on which we now embark. I believe that Washington has to change before we can ask America to change. On Tuesday I kept my campaign pledge to cut the White House staff by 25 percent below the level that I found it. That was a significant cut, but I want to emphasize to you I did it the way most of you would have done it. I didn't just slash the numbers. We have reorganized the White House staff, and I believe this smaller group will increase its ability to serve the American people. We now have an Economic Security Council to go with our National Security Council and our domestic policy operation. We're going to have a smaller drug policy operation, but it's finally going to have something to do with the rest of the Government. It's not going to be politics and speeches and posturing; it's going to be affecting the policies of every department of the National Government. We are going to have a smaller, but more importantly, far more productive White House. And on yesterday, we extended those measures to the entire Government, ordering a reduction in Federal bureaucracy by 100,000 people by attrition over the next 4 years, with at least 10 percent of those cuts to come from senior management, and ordering agency and department costs to be reduced by between 3 and up to 5 percent over the next 4 years, for savings in excess of $9 billion by administrative actions alone&mdash;and again, not cutting for cuts' sake but to redirect those monies to more productive purposes and leaving those departments not only leaner but more efficient than they were before. This is just the beginning. We are going to reexamine whether you're getting your money's worth. One of the people I spoke with already this morning said, I can give you some examples of things that work and things that don't in the National Government. I'll just mention one publicly because we all know it doesn't work: The Superfund has been a disaster. All the money goes to lawyers, and none of the money goes to clean up the problems that it was designed to clean up. Those are the kinds of challenges we expect to do a better job of meeting, perhaps with fewer people whenever possible, but with greater productivity. Now I ask you to do your part. We have to replace this social contract that somehow crept into our thinking in the 1980's, that somehow we had to have greater inequality in this country to get prosperity. That was the idea. Even in the years in which we created jobs, income inequality was exacerbated in America. Now I think we need a new compact. Everybody does his or her part, pays their fair share, joins our national effort, and garners the rewards of a growing economy. The plan I will offer will give a climate in which you can grow, investing in people and the best trained work force in the world, giving us the kind of flexible employees that we all need. That is Government's responsibility to work with you to do and one that we have not done a very good job of in the past. We want to lower the cost of capital through long-term reductions in the deficit. We want to provide special incentives to new enterprises with long-term capital gains treatment. We want to provide some changes in the Tax Code that will plainly reward investment as opposed to consumption in the business sector. But we also have to face the fact that the deficit will not vanish in a flash. We will cut it, and we will cut it as much as we reasonably can. And if our plan is adopted, it will be the first time since the 1940's that the Government has succeeded in dramatically slashing the debt. And I might add, it was inevitable then at the end of World War II, when the debt was running at about 120 percent of gross national product. We are going to work as hard as we can, and we desperately need your support to do it, to bring health care costs under control. I have to say this: If you want this deficit brought down, not for 4 years but for 8 or 10 years until we can do away with it, it will never, ever be done until we pass a national health plan to control costs and provide a basic health system for all Americans and to stop shifting costs onto you for people who aren't insured. It will never happen unless we do that. Fifty percent&mdash;let me reiterate&mdash;fifty percent of the projected growth in this debt between now and the year 2000 is in health care costs. And we only pay 33 percent of the national health care bill. More than two-thirds of it is being paid by you. And the same thing will happen to your cost. The best thing the President and the Congress could do for the American economy over the next decade is to bring health costs in line with inflation. It would free up hundreds of billions of dollars to reinvest in new jobs and higher incomes and greater productivity and growth. And we must not delay that. So I implore you not only to feel that you can be involved in our deliberations on what should be in the national health strategy but also to help us pass that, along with this budget, in Congress this year. I want to also do something the governments of our competitors do without apology. I think we ought to have pragmatic partnerships with the private sector to strengthen our technological leadership. Research and development resources should shift toward technologies that will translate into commercial successes. And we must work together to create a national information infrastructure. One of the things I've been determined to do in all these budget meetings we've been having for the last 3 weeks is to make sure that every dollar by which we reduce research and development in the defense budget finds itself into an increase in the domestic research and development budget of this country, and more. We have got to do that. We also should give you more incentives to invest, as I said. I want to reform the corporate tax system to ensure that it rewards and encourages those who invest in productivity: in plant, equipment, research and development, in people who will create the jobs and the markets of tomorrow. And in return, we must ask your contribution to bringing the deficit down. Let me say something I haven't said yet. We did not just cut the White House staff and the executive administrative costs of this budget. You will see there are a lot of other very real cuts in Federal spending&mdash;and they will be real, definable and measurable, not imaginary&mdash;that will be laid on the table before the Congress and the American people. Once we do that, we must ask for greater contributions to close this deficit. And we should begin with those whose taxes were reduced and whose incomes went up in the 1980's, the wealthiest Americans and corporations. I will ask for an increase, as I said in the campaign, on the income tax for the wealthiest Americans and corporations, along with the incentives that I have recommended to get people&mdash;lower their tax burden if, but only if, they make investments in this country. Our situation is worsened, and we may have to broaden the range of revenues which we seek. But we should begin by asking those who can most afford to pay to do so.I have also been persuaded by my Treasury Secretary that it is unwise, indeed impossible, to raise the individual income tax rate unless there is a corresponding increase in the corporate tax rate to avoid tax shifting. But the corporations should also have incentives to reinvest as their rates are raised. And so we have done both things in the plan we will recommend. I talked a lot in the campaign about an issue which has relatively small dollar impact but great significance to the American working people, and that is the enormously increased rate of executive compensation in the last 12 years as compared with the compensation of workers. I want to make a proposal that deals with the fact that the Tax Code should no longer subsidize excessive pay of chief executives and other high executives, excessive defined as unrelated to the productivity of the enterprise. I believe, finally, that if all of us do what we're supposed to do, if I can ask every American honestly to look in the mirror and say, What do I want this country to look like in 4 years? What do I want this country to look like in 10 years? What do I want this country to look like when my children are my age? Do I really want to let yet another opportunity go by when we just wander through a year instead of really investing in our people and our fixture, instead of really having a technology policy, instead of really having an economic strategy, instead of really doing something about the credit crunch, instead of really doing something about health care, instead of really doing something about the deficit, just because I wish I didn't have to change my ways?&mdash;I think almost every American will look in the mirror and say no, no, this year we'll pull together and do our part. If the business community leads the way, Congress will follow. I need your help. I hope you'll be there.Thank you very much.",clinton
"Thank you very much, Willie Brown. And thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for letting me join you by high-tech communications for just a few minutes. First of all, let me say how very impressed I was by the comment of the previous speaker. He may not have been in California very long, but I think his prescription for how to solve our Nation's problems, concentrating on investment and achieving consensus, is what we all have to focus on. I wish I could be with you in person today. You know, I have spent a great deal of time in California in the last 16 months talking to people about the problems and the promise of your State. I don't believe for a moment that America's economy can recover until California recovers, and I applaud what you are doing in this economic summit. I understand the economic summit that I sponsored down in Little Rock for our Nation may have been part of the inspiration for this meeting, and if so, I'm very grateful. I applaud Willie Brown and Senator Roberti and Governor Wilson for cosponsoring this, and all the rest of you who are part of it. Let me get to the point very quickly because I think that these summits work so much better when there is interaction, so I don't want to intrude on what I think is going very well. First, I want to reaffirm my commitment to the economic revitalization of California. Californians played a major role in my election as President and play a very major role in my Presidency now, people who are important to your future. Our Trade Ambassador, Mickey Kantor, has already spoken this morning; you know he's from California. The Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, is from California, and we're increasingly involving the State Department in the revitalization of the American economy. Our Budget Director, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Leon Panetta, was a Congressman from northern California and is here with me; I'm in his building as we speak today. And of course, the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, Laura Tyson, is from northern California. All of these people are in a position to bring their experience and knowledge to bear on what we in the National Government can do. In addition to that, I've already had an extensive visit with Senator Feinstein. I've talked with Senator Boxer. I've talked with many members of your congressional delegation about the issues that they have brought to my attention. And as I said, the time I spent there taught me a lot about the problems in California that are caused by reducing employment in the defense industry, by the collapse of real estate, by the problems in the financial institutions, by the general manufacturing difficulties, and by the increased costs brought on by immigration as well as the population increase generally in California. Let me say first that I'm convinced we're going to have to solve this problem by partnership. I am offering the American people a program which will reverse three big trends in our country which have affected California. We built an American dream, especially after World War II, based on increasing economic prosperity in a high-wage, high-growth economy, increasing equality among our working people, and making more and more strength out of our diversity. The economic and social difficulties we have faced in the last few years threaten to reverse all those trends. Wages are stagnant. Inequality has increased over the last decade, and our diversity has often been a source of great tension and division in California and elsewhere throughout the country. I'm convinced that in order to change this, the National Government has to take the lead, first of all in investing in our people, their jobs, their technology, and their future; secondly, in dealing with the health care crisis; thirdly, in reducing the enormous Federal debt to stabilize long-term interest rates and free up more money for investment in the private sector; and finally, by developing economic policies in partnership with the private sector which encourage more investment in the private sector and which enable us to work together to create that highwage, high-growth economy again. As that applies to California, it means we will be doing the following things: First of all, in my economic program there's a plan to jumpstart the economy, to create another halfmillion jobs in the near future. California will receive a significant number of those jobs. Secondly, I intend to follow through on the technology policy I announced in California in the last campaign. That means we'll be providing more incentives to start new enterprises and to expand existing enterprises and to build on the job-generating capacity of the technology-leading companies that are in your State. Thirdly, I want to invest in our children and their future and our educational system. I want to do what I can at the national level to alleviate some of the problems caused by the financial conditions you have there. Fourthly, I'll ask the Congress to change some of the tax rules involving passive losses in hope of alleviating some of the real estate problems in California, as well as giving industry more incentive to invest in the next couple of years. Next, Mr. Panetta and I have worked hard on trying to figure out how we can redesign some of these Federal programs so that the Federal Government can keep its commitment to the States that have been overwhelmed by immigration problems, California most of all, but also Texas and Florida and some other States who should have been helped more by the National Government because of the burdens they bear due to a national policy on immigration. Finally, let me just say, if I might harken back again to the last person who spoke before I did, California has some challenges that will have to be met by Californians. You will have to take the lead in improving your education system. I'm going to give you a good Department of Education that will help to reform the practices in education and to make education work again. But some of the premier reformers in America are right there in California now. You have to find a way to make their exceptions the rule in California education. And next, you will have to take the lead in making sure your manufacturing and production environment is at least competitive with other States in the United States, not by driving down wages but by changing the environment so that you can be competitive. I'll do whatever I can to support you. The best thing we could do here to help you with that is to solve the health care crisis: to bring health care costs in line with inflation; to make basic, affordable health care available to all; and therefore, to stop whatever incentives there are for people to move across State lines or to move their plants because they've got high embedded health care costs. But a lot of these productivity issues are going to have to be faced, and faced squarely, by the people of California and every other State. We're prepared to do our part. I'll say again: This country cannot rise again to its full potential until California is on the move again. I'm going to do what I can to help. I ask you for your support in my aggressive plan to reduce the debt and to increase investment in education and training, in new technologies, in new jobs, and in dealing with the health care crisis. I'll do what I can to support you. Together, we can turn this country around. We can lift California up, and California can once again be the beacon of hope for America and for the world. Thank you very much.",clinton
"Warm greetings to everyone celebrating Kwanzaa. One of the best ways we can shape the future is to preserve what we value of our past. The celebration of Kwanzaa is a wonderful example of this endeavor. With its focus on the values that have sustained African Americans through the centuries&mdash;unity, self-determination, collective work and responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity, and faith&mdash;Kwanzaa also emphasizes the importance of strong families and communities to our success as a nation in the years to come. African Americans have a proud history and a rich heritage. During this holiday season, as Americans of many different backgrounds remember and rejoice in their cultural and religious traditions, let us all give thanks for the diversity that is among America's greatest strengths, and let us unite around the shared dreams and values that bind us together as one nation.

"To the Congress of the United States: I hereby report to the Congress on the developments since the last report of August 3, 1992, concerning the national emergency with respect to Iraq that was declared in Executive Order No. 12722 of August 2, 1990. This report is submitted pursuant to sections 401(c) of the National Emergencies Act (NEA), 50 U.S.C. 1641(e), and section 204(c) of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), 50 U.S.C. 1703(c). Executive Order No. 12722 ordered the immediate blocking of all property and interests in property of the Government of Iraq (including the Central Bank of Iraq) then or thereafter located in the United States or within the possession or control of a U.S. person. That order also prohibited the importation into the United States of goods and services of Iraqi origin, as well as the exportation of goods, services, and technology from the United States to Iraq. The order prohibited travel-related transactions to or from Iraq and the performance of any contract in support of any industrial, commercial, or governmental project in Iraq. U.S. persons were also prohibited from granting or extending credit or loans to the Government of Iraq. The foregoing prohibitions (as well as the blocking of Government of Iraq property) were continued and augmented on August 9, 1990, by Executive Order No. 12724, which was issued in order to align the sanctions imposed by the United States with United Nations Security Council Resolution 661 of August 6, 1990. This report discusses only matters concerning the national emergency with respect to Iraq that was declared in Executive Order No. 12722 and matters relating to Executive Orders Nos. 12724 and 12817 (the Executive Orders). The report covers events from August 2, 1992, through February 1, 1993. 1. On October 21, 1992, President Bush issued Executive Order No. 12817, implementing in the United States measures adopted in United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) No. 778 of October 2, 1992. UNSCR No. 778 requires U.N. member states temporarily to transfer to a U.N. escrow account up to $200 million apiece in Iraqi oil proceeds paid by the purchaser after the imposition of U.N. sanctions on Iraq. These funds finance Iraq's obligations for U.N. activities with respect to Iraq, including expenses to verify Iraqi weapons destruction and to provide humanitarian assistance in Iraq on a nonpartisan basis. A portion of the escrowed funds will also fund the activities of the U.N. Compensation Commission in Geneva, which will handle claims from victims of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. The funds placed in the escrow account are to be returned, with interest, to the member states that transferred them to the U.N., as funds are received from future sales of Iraqi oil authorized by the United Nations Security Council. No member state is required to fund more than half of the total contributions to the escrow account. Executive Order No. 12817 authorized the Secretary of the Treasury (the Secretary) to identify the proceeds of the sale of Iraqi petroleum or petroleum products paid for by or on behalf of the purchaser on or after August 6, 1990, and directed United States financial institutions holding such funds to transfer them to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) in the manner required by the Secretary. Executive Order No. 12817 further directs the FRBNY to receive, hold, and transfer funds in which the Government of Iraq has an interest at the direction of the Secretary to fulfill U.S. rights and obligations pursuant to UNSCR No. 778. 2. The economic sanctions imposed on Iraq by the Executive orders are administered by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (FAC) pursuant to the Iraqi Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR Part 575 (ISR). The ISR were amended on September 1, 1992, to revoke section 575.603, which had required U.S. financial institutions to file monthly reports regarding certain bank accounts in which the Government of Iraq has an interest. While this information was needed during the early implementation of the regulations and for a period thereafter, it is no longer required on a monthly basis and can be obtained by FAC on a case-by-case basis as required. The amendment is in harmony with President Bush's Regulatory Initiative. 3. Investigations of possible violations of the Iraqi sanctions continue to be pursued and appropriate enforcement actions taken. These are intended to deter future activities in violation of the sanctions. Additional civil penalty notices were prepared during the reporting period for violations of the IEEPA and ISR with respect to transactions involving Iraq. Penalties were collected, principally from financial institutions which engaged in unauthorized, albeit apparently inadvertent, transactions with respect to Iraq. 4. Investigation also continues into the roles played by various individuals and firms outside Iraq in Saddam Hussein's procurement network. These investigations may lead to additions to the FAC listing of individuals and organizations determined to be Specially Designated Nationals (SDNs) of the Government of Iraq. 5. Pursuant to Executive Order No. 12817 implementing UNSCR No. 778, on October 26, 1992, FAC directed the FRBNY to establish a blocked account for receipt of certain post-August 6, 1990, Iraqi oil sales proceeds, and to hold, invest, and transfer these funds as required by the order. On the same date, FAC directed the eight United States financial institutions holding the affected oil proceeds, on an allocated, pro rata basis, to transfer a total of $200 million of these blocked Iraqi assets to the FRBNY account. On December 15, 1992, following the payment of $20 million by the Government of Kuwait and $30 million by the Government of Saudi Arabia to a special United Nations-controlled account, entitled UNSCR No. 778 Escrow Account, the FRBNY was directed to transfer a corresponding amount of $50 million from the blocked account it holds to the United Nations-controlled account. Future transfers from the blocked FRBNY account will be made on a matching basis up to the $200 million for which the United States is potentially obligated pursuant to UNSCR No. 778. 6. Since the last report, one case filed against the Government of Iraq has gone to judgment. Consarc Corporation v. Iraqi Ministry of Industry and Minerals et al., No. 90-2269 (D.D.C., filed December 29, 1992), arose out of a contract for the sale of furnaces by plaintiff to the Iraqi Ministry of Industry and Minerals (MIM), an Iraqi governmental entity. In connection with the contract, the Iraqi defendants opened an irrevocable letter of credit with an Iraqi bank in favor of Consarc, which was advised by Pittsburgh National Bank (PNB), with the Bank of New York (BONY) entering into a confirmed reimbursement agreement with the advising bank. Funds were set aside at BONY, in an account of the Iraqi bank, for reimbursement of BONY if PNB made a payment to Consarc on the letter of credit and sought reimbursement from BONY. Consarc received a down payment from the Iraqi MIM and manufactured the furnaces. No goods were shipped prior to imposition of sanctions on August 2, 1990, and the United States claimed that the funds on deposit in the Iraqi bank account at BONY were blocked, as well as the furnaces manufactured for the Iraqi Government or the proceeds of the sale of the furnaces to third parties. The district court ruled that the furnaces or their sales proceeds were properly blocked pursuant to the declaration of the national emergency and blocking of Iraqi Government property interests, but that, due to fraud on MIM's part in concluding the sales contract, the funds on deposit in an Iraqi bank account at BONY were not the property of the Government of Iraq, and ordered FAC to unblock these funds. FAC has noted its appeal of this ruling. 7. FAC has issued a total of 337 specific licenses regarding transactions pertaining to Iraq or Iraqi assets since August 1990. Since the last report, 49 specific licenses have been issued. Licenses were issued for transactions such as the filing of legal actions involving Iraqi interests, for legal representation of Iraq, and the exportation to Iraq of donated medicine, medical supplies, and food intended for humanitarian relief purposes. To ensure compliance with the terms of the licenses which have been issued, stringent reporting requirements have been imposed that are closely monitored. Licensed accounts are regularly audited by FAC compliance personnel and deputized auditors from other regulatory agencies. FAC compliance personnel continue to work closely with both State and Federal bank regulatory and law enforcement agencies in conducting special audits of Iraqi accounts subject to the ISR. 8. The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the 6-month period from August 2, 1992, through February 1, 1993, that are directly attributable to the exercise of powers and authorities conferred by the declaration of a national emergency with respect to Iraq are estimated at about $2 million, most of which represents wage and salary costs for Federal personnel. Personnel costs were largely centered in the Department of the Treasury (particularly in FAC, the U.S. Customs Service, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Enforcement, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for International Affairs, and the Office of the General Counsel), the Department of State (particularly the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs, the Bureau of Near East and South Asian Affairs, the Bureau of International Organizations, and the Office of the Legal Adviser), the Department of Transportation (particularly the U.S. Coast Guard), and the Department of Commerce (particularly in the Bureau of Export Administration and the Office of the General Counsel). 9. The United States imposed economic sanctions on Iraq in response to Iraq's invasion and illegal occupation of Kuwait, a clear act of brutal aggression. The United States, together with the international community, is maintaining economic sanctions against Iraq because the Iraqi regime has failed to comply fully with United Nations Security Council resolutions, including those calling for the elimination of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, the inviolability of the Iraq-Kuwait boundary, the release of Kuwaiti and other third country nationals, compensation for victims of Iraqi aggression, long-term monitoring of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) capabilities, and the return of Kuwaiti assets stolen during its illegal occupation of Kuwait. The U.N. sanctions remain in place; the United States will continue to enforce those sanctions. The Saddam Hussein regime continued to violate basic human rights by repressing the Iraqi civilian population and depriving it of humanitarian assistance. The United Nations Security Council passed resolutions that permit Iraq to sell $1.6 billion of oil under U.N. auspices to fund the provision of food, medicine, and other humanitarian supplies to the people of Iraq. Under the U.N. resolutions, the equitable distribution within Iraq of this assistance would be supervised and monitored by the United Nations. The Iraqi regime continued to refuse to accept these resolutions and has thereby chosen to perpetuate the suffering of its civilian population. The regime of Saddam Hussein continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, as well as to regional peace and security. Because of Iraq's failure to comply fully with United Nations Security Council resolutions, the United States will therefore continue to apply economic sanctions to deter Iraq from threatening peace and stability in the region, and I will continue to report periodically to the Congress on significant developments, pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 1703(c).WILLIAM J.

"Thank you. I love these signs: Our children's future starts today. Health care for all. No guts, no glory: Stop gridlock. The Devil's in the details. That's right, too. Divided we'll go down the tubes. We want real recovery. I love these signs, and I thank you all for being here today. Let me begin by saying how much I enjoyed flying down here with Congressman Clay and Congressman Gephardt and with Congressman Volkmer and Congresswoman Danner; they're here, too. They are part of the engine for change that you're going to see move through our Congress. I thank Bill Clay for hosting us in his district, and I want to congratulate him on the passage and this time the signing, not the veto, of the Family and Medical Leave Act. I want to say how glad I am to be back in St. Louis with your Governor, my longtime friend and early supporter. And I know that he will be a great success, and I'm going to do what I can to be his partner in Washington. I know from clear experience that we don't have all the answers, and I'll do what I can to see that we make as many decisions as possible out here in the Governor's offices where the rubber meets the road. And I thank him for being here. I want to recognize two of the groups that performed, the Fox High School Band and Harris-Stowe College Choir. Let me say a word if I might about our majority leader, Dick Gephardt. There is no way that I can convey to the people of St. Louis and Missouri how important he is to the Nation. But I can tell you this: I'm not sure we could do any of the things we have to do if it were not for his leadership. If you knew all the times that he had brought together the other Members of the House of Representatives on the Democratic side and told them they were going to have to cut spending as well as raise money, told them we were going to have to change our priorities, told them we were going to have to stick together to turn this country around, and been a force for moral leadership within the United States Congress, the heart of every person not just in his district but this whole State would swell with pride to know that you're represented by somebody like that. If you knew all the times that I heard him stick up in private for the men and women who build the cars and build the airplanes and brew the beer and provide the backbone of America, you would know that he doesn't just say things in public and then behave differently in private. He is the same everywhere. And I am very glad that he is my full partner in this crusade to change our country. You know, St. Louis is a special place for me. It's here where we ended the first of our wonderful bus trips across America and where we had a rally of about 40,000 people. It was the biggest crowd we'd had at that time in the campaign. And we started our second bus trip over in east St. Louis. And then we had the first Presidential debate here. So I think it's only fitting that I would come to my neighboring State in the heartland of America to start day one of America's new direction. I was in Missouri on the other side of the State on Labor Day, and I went to Harry Truman's home town. I guess in some ways the talk I gave to Congress last night was like one of President Truman's talks. Some of it was just off the top of my head and from the bottom of my heart. It was sort of plain spoken, and I couldn't figure out how else to say what I think is the plain truth about where we are. This is a country of enormous promise, of unlimited potential, of a great future burdened by big problems. I think everybody knows that. And we also know, I think, that some mistakes have been made in the course we have taken. The fundamental problems we have are because of big, sweeping changes in history: America being pushed into a global economy, all of us being subject to changes at a far more rapid rate than ever before. But we know that the responses we have taken have not worked. There are too many people who are unemployed. There are too many people who are underemployed. There ate too many people who have lost good jobs, that cannot get jobs at that income left. There are too many people with no health insurance and too many others terrified of losing it. There are too many people who don't have access to the education over a lifetime that they need to continually be retrained. There are too many places where we are not investing in the future. There are too many industries, like the aerospace industry in Missouri and throughout the country, that we know will produce a huge portion of the high-wage jobs of the future all over the world, and yet, they're dying on the vine here in America. These things don't make sense. What we have been doing has not worked. We need to take a new direction that will build a high-wage, high-growth, secure future where people can be educated, where there is affordable health care for all, and where Americans have a fair chance to compete and win. That's what this is all about. I want to repeat to you what I said to the Congress last night. I remember in 1981 when President Reagan said if you stacked 1,000-dollar bills on top of each other, our national debt would go 67 miles into the sky. If you did it today, it would go 267 miles into the sky. I say that not to blame him, not to blame my predecessor, not to blame anybody. Goodness knows, there's enough blame to go around, both parties and the Presidency and the Congress, but what good is it going to do us? Let us forget about blame and take responsibility for our future. Let's do it together. I don't care who gets the credit, I just want us to go forward. There are already people who are saying that we really can't make fundamental changes. There are people who are saying, Well, you can't bring the deficit down, or Well, nobody will hang in there and make these tough budget cuts the President's proposing, or Well, you can't really reform the health care system, even though we're paying more and getting less for ours than any country on the face of the Earth. I'm tired of all the nay-sayers. I think we can make some changes. But we need your help. We need your help in two ways: Number one, we need you to show up like this, and we need you to tell your Members of Congress that we will support you if you make the honest, tough, hard decisions. We know we didn't get into this mess overnight. We're not going to get out of it overnight. But we cannot keep doing the same old thing. The price of doing the same thing is higher than the price of change. The second thing you can do is to support your Members of Congress by demanding real political reform that will protect them in making courageous changes. Tell them you want a campaign finance reform bill that will limit the cost of congressional campaigns, limit the influence of special interests, and open this process to all people. Tell them you want something done to make sure all of the lobbyists in Washington have to register and report on their activities; twothirds of them don't. Tell them you support our bill to remove the tax deduction for lobbying activities. You are subsidizing interests that together undermine your future. Individually they've all got a good story to tell, but collectively they help to paralyze the political process. And you, at least, should not subsidize it with your tax dollars because you don't have comparable deductions. My fellow Americans, last night I tried to lay out to the Congress and to the American people a plan that will change the direction of this country and give us a genuine economic strategy, a plan to produce more jobs, higher income, deal with the health care crisis, provide a lifetime system of education, and reduce the national debt. We have to begin with the Government, and at the top with the President. So I have tried to set an example. I have cut the White House staff by 25 percent. That will be in my budget for the White House. I have cut the administrative costs of the executive branch in my budget 14 percent over the next 4 years, over and above the cuts in The White House, and we'll reduce employment, not by firing people but by attrition, by 100,000 over the next 4 years. That will save $9 billion. And yesterday the leaders of the House and the Senate announced that the Congress would follow our lead and cut their budgets by that much, which I think is good. There are 150 other specific cuts in this budget, including some that were very tough for me to recommend, some in programs that don't make any sense anymore. For example, do you remember when we had the Bicentennial celebration in 1976? There is still a Bicentennial Commission. Our Government's great at starting things and not very good at stopping things. So we eliminated a lot of things that ought to be stopped. The second thing we did was to reduce our investment in programs that have done a lot of good, but where the amount you're spending can't be justified anymore, including one that was really close to my heart. We recommended a reduction in the Federal subsidy to the Rural Electric Administration, something that serves a lot of people in my State and yours. But America is 100 percent electrified now, and we ought not to have the full subsidy continued from all of the rest of the people who get their electricity from someplace else. We recommended some unwarranted subsidies be eliminated because the need for the work is much less or nonexistent anymore. For example, we recommended a big cutback in a lot of programs related to the nuclear industry and the elimination of a nuclear research program that is inconsistent with our new energy future. We recommended some big changes in the environmental Superfund program: one, to make the polluters pay more and the taxpayers pay less and the second, to get the money freed up so that we can use the money to clean up pollution. It's all going to lawyer fees now, because people don't want anything to happen. We're going to try to make it work. Finally, I recommended&mdash;and this was difficult for me because I can't do anything as your President in the end without the support of the fine people in the Federal work force-but we recommended a freeze on Federal pay raises for a year and modest pay raises for the next 3, because that saves billions of dollars that we don't have to take out of the rest of the people in taxes to reduce the deficit. So there are 150 tough cuts. Now, let me say I've already heard some people on the other side of the aisle say, Well, he should have cut more. And my answer is: Show me where, but be specific. No hot air. Show me where, and be specific. And since I am here in Missouri, I think I will repeat that. Show me. And I say that not in the spirit of partisanship but in the spirit of genuine challenge. I know there is more that we can eliminate. I am honestly looking. I've just been there 4 weeks and a day, and I'm nowhere near through. And I want you to help me, and I want them to help me. Let me say also, the burdens in terms of taxes I think are imposed in a fair way. The rates of 98.9 percent of Americans will not be raised. Late in the last election, the New York Times carried a front-page story showing that 70 percent of the gains of the 1980's had been reaped by the top one percent of the people. This plan asked the top 1.2 percent of the people to have an income tax increase. This plan asked companies with incomes of over $10 million to match that income tax increase. This plan raises over 70 percent of the funds from people with incomes above $100,000. This plan raises no money from people with incomes below $30,000. And indeed, because we increased the refundable income tax credit, this plan, if it passes, will enable us to do something I would think every American would be proud of. For the first time ever, if this plan passes, we can say to the people of this country: Look, we are rewarding work and family. If you work full-time and you've got a kid in your house, you won't live in poverty because of the changes we're going to have in the tax system. People making $40,000, $50,000, in that range, will pay about $17 a month under this plan. But let me tell you, a lot of those people, many of whom are in this station today, may wind up not being out any more money for this reason: Just since the election, since I said we're going to have a tough plan to reduce this debt, long-term interest rates have gone down. If you take only the reduction in interest rates which have occurred from the election day until this day, for everybody who gets the benefit of those lower interest rates in a home mortgage, a car payment, consumer credit, you will make more in lower interest rates than you'll pay in the energy tax if we can show that we're serious about cutting spending and cutting this deficit. We've got to do it. One final thing which you'll also hear about from people who oppose this plan: I do propose to spend some more money, but not in the old way. Look at what we spend it for. We have reduced Government consumption. We have reduced inessential programs. But we increase spending on jobs: a jobs program to create a half a million jobs starting right now in building roads, repairing streets, fixing airports, cleaning up the environment with water systems and sewer systems; a million summer jobs for young people, if I could get the private sector to contribute to the 700,000 we're going to create in the Government. This program invests in opening the doors of college education to all people and giving them a chance to pay the loan back on favorable terms or to pay it back with service to our country. This plan will put 100,000 police officers on the streets of America over the next 4 years. This plan will give us a chance to invest in the new technologies that will create jobs for the people who have lost their jobs in the defense industries and in other big industries that have been downscaling. We have got to create some new jobs in this country, for goodness sakes. You can have all the other programs in the world, and unless we do it, we're going to be in trouble. And this plan will reduce the deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 5 years. And I ask you, I ask you to support it not just for you but for us, not just for narrow interest but for the national interest. I believe it will be good for virtually every American. Today as we speak, a lot of big corporate executives are endorsing this plan, even though their income tax bills will go up, their companies' bills will go up, because they want a healthy, strong, well-educated, vibrant America with an investment climate that's good, with stable interest rates, with a declining deficit, with a health care issue addressed, and with a country that can grow into the 21st century. So a lot of the people who are paying this bill are going to support it because they trust us. And let me say this: We need you to hold our feet to the fire. No raising taxes unless we cut spending. We've got to do this in a package, and we've got to do it together. I need your help. I'm delighted to see you here today. With your help we can make the spirit of St. Louis the spirit of America.Thank you, and God bless you all.",clinton
"Good morning. This week we celebrated the creation of 4 million new jobs in America since I became President on a platform to renew the American dream by restoring our economy, empowering individual Americans to compete and win in it, making Government work for ordinary citizens, and rebuilding our communities. Since we started our national economic strategy, our private sector is creating jobs nearly 8 times faster than it was 4 years ago. It hasn't been easy to make these changes. We had to make some tough decisions to put our economic house in order. We had to break the bad habits that led to mismanagement of our economy and the explosion of our deficit for more than a decade. And we had to break through all of the partisan barriers and political rhetoric that too often keeps us from doing the right thing for the American people here in Washington, DC. Today I want to talk with you about two other historic decisions that call on us to break through partisan barriers and political rhetoric again. For very soon, Congress will vote on both health care reform and the crime bill, two issues crucial to our mission of renewing the American dream. I want to talk to you about two young Americans whose stories are the best arguments I've heard for why we have to fix what's wrong with our health care system and make our country safer again for all Americans. One of those young people is Amanda Stewart from Keyes, Oklahoma. This week, I gave awards to four young people who have done heroic deeds or performed remarkable public service. Amanda was one of them. She was injured in a car wreck in 1990 and paralyzed from the chest down. This wonderful young lady could have given up on life. Instead of becoming bitter or defeated, she's devoted herself to educating other young people not to drink and drive, not to ride with people who do, and to always use seat belts. She's helping others to avoid what happened to her. I met Amanda's family. Her father is a hardworking farmer in western Oklahoma. She has a lovely mother and a wonderful younger sister. She hasn't had any significant medical costs since just after her accident 4 years ago. The Stewarts have been paying $3,400 a year for a limited health insurance policy with a high deductible. But recently they were told that this month their insurance premiums were going to be raised to $9,600 a year. Now, Amanda's father happens to be not only a farmer but a Republican. He's in a different party from me, and he made it clear to me that he doesn't want the National Government to give him anything. But he's got a family to raise, and he has no idea how he's going to keep paying for their health insurance. He said to me that if he couldn't take care of his family, as hard as he was working, something was wrong in this country. People like Amanda and her family are the reason we have to guarantee private, not Government, health insurance for every American, insurance that's always there. It's time to do what's right by those people. We're going in the wrong direction now. There are 5 million Americans just like Amanda's family who had insurance 5 years ago who don't have it today. Almost every one of them are working people and their children. We can do better, and we must. It's also time we do what's right for young people like James Darby, the 9-year-old boy from New Orleans who wrote me last April. He asked me to do something about the crime rate. He asked me to stop the killing, because he was afraid that someone might kill him. And just 9 days later, walking home from a Mother's Day picnic, little James Darby was shot in the head and killed. Well, 9 days ago, after 6 years of delay, a bipartisan committee of the Senate and the House of Representatives reconciled their differences on the smartest, toughest crime bill in the history of this country and sent the bill back to be voted on for final passage in both Houses of Congress. It took a lot of work. It's a bipartisan effort and has been every step of the way. Both Democrats and Republicans have voted for every part of it: three strikes and you're out and tougher punishments for other tough criminals; 100,000 new police officers on our streets&mdash;that's a 20 percent increase all across America; a ban on deadly assault weapons; a law that makes it illegal for minors to own and possess handguns; new prisons to keep hardened criminals in; and billions for new, effective prevention programs to give our young people something to say yes to, not just something to say no to. Nine days ago when the bill was sent to both Houses for final passage, I thought it would pass quickly and be sent to my desk for signing. But it still hasn't happened. Here's the one last hurdle: You see, before the House of Representatives can vote on a bill, it must agree on the rules for debate about the bill. There are 435 Members of the House, and they have to have some rules to limit debate. In shorthand, this is called the rule. The rule is purely a procedural matter, but it must be voted on before the final bill can pass. Unfortunately, the National Rifle Association, which is opposed to the assault weapons ban in the bill, and some other interests are trying to keep the crime bill from passing by defeating the rule. They're putting pressure on Members of Congress to kill the crime bill in a trick maneuver, because they know that once the bill itself gets to a vote, it will surely pass. You know, we had a tough fight with the NRA over the ban on assault weapons. And those of us who think they should be banned won by only two votes. But we won fair and square. No parliamentary trick should reverse that result and put the rest of that important crime bill in peril. Now, some Members of Congress honestly oppose the crime bill. They're against the assault weapons ban or they're against the capital punishment provisions of the bill or they're against spending money on prevention programs to give our kids a better future. Well, let them vote against the bill. Let them vote their conscience. But the NRA and the others should come out of the shadows. They ought to fight this bill on the merits. If they really want a shootout, we really ought to have it at broad daylight and high noon, not in the shadows of parliamentary maneuvering. No one should play any more political games with our Nation's safety. Nine days after 9-year-old James Darby wrote me saying he was worrying about his safety and pleading with his President to help, he was shot dead. Nine days ago, the House and the Senate got the crime bill. There are lots of other little James Darbys out there, and they've waited long enough. For Amanda Stewart and her fine family, for James Darby, for every American child and for all of their families and their futures, let's stop playing games with these two important issues. Let's get the job done. Thanks for listening.",clinton
"Hello. Thank you for waiting while I visited with one of your fellow citizens over there and her two children. I want to just get out and shake hands, so I won't make a long speech. But I would like to say, first, be supportive of the new candidate for the United States Senate, Congressman Bob Carr, and our new candidate for Governor, former Congressman Howard Wolpe. I'm glad to be here with Congressman Dingell and Congressman Conyers and Senator Levin and with your State officials and a lot of my friends in Michigan. I just want to make a comment or two. The lady to my left is Linda Clark. You may have read about her in the Michigan press, she and her two children. In 1993, her husband was killed in his business by five young people with previous criminal records. After he died, she received a $24,000 bill from the hospital for his medical care, even though she didn't have health insurance. Since then, she has become a crusader for health care for all Americans and for a sensible policy on crime and, specifically, a supporter of our crime and health care initiatives. I read her letter again coming in today, and I asked her and her children to come here and be with me today because in Washington, very often what we do gets all caught up in partisan political rhetoric and name-calling and stuff that is very hard for ordinary citizens to understand. And I just want to make two or three points here today. When I went to Washington as your President, I understood well that there would be forces there who would do anything, anything to fight change, to keep the established order of things, to stop us in our determination to give the American people their Government back again, to make it work for ordinary citizens, and to reawaken the American dream. But I want to ask you to look at the record, not the hype. When I became President, the deficit was going up, and the economy was going down. By the narrowest of margins, we passed our national economic strategy. It cut $255 billion worth of spending. It raised taxes on the wealthiest 1.2 percent of Americans, and all their money went to pay down the deficit. It gave a tax break to 15 million American working families. In Michigan that means 392,000 families got a tax cut; 41,000 got a tax increase. Ninety-one percent of the American small businesses were made eligible for a tax cut. We shrunk the Federal Government to its smallest size since Kennedy was President, produced 3 years of deficit reduction in a row for the first time since Harry Truman was President, and you've got 4.1 million new jobs in the United States since our administration took office. And since our administration took office, job growth in Michigan has been 3 1/2 times what it was before. It is no wonder that the other party would rather not talk about economics or crime or health care and instead are interested in other things and division and always saying no. We did not have a single, solitary vote, not one, for that economic strategy from the opposition party. And I have done everything I could to reach out to people without regard to their party and ask for a bipartisan consensus to govern America. You just remember that, folks, when Bob Carr is up here asking for your vote for the United States Senate. If it hadn't been for him, there would have been no deficit reduction, there would have been no economic recovery fueled by the first sensible economic plan we've had in more than 12 years. They want to go back; we're trying to go forward. And I appreciate your coming out here today saying you don't want to go back, you'd rather go forward, you'd rather create jobs, you'd rather grow the economy, you'd rather keep the American dream alive. Now, let me just make two other points. There's hardly a family in America that has not been affected by crime. And the Congress has passed the toughest, smartest crime bill in history in each House, but they haven't passed the same bill. There are things in that bill that are controversial. There are people who don't support the capital punishment provisions of the bill. There are people who don't support the fact that the bill bans 19 assault weapons, which are so often used by criminal gangs, even though it protects 650 hunting and sporting weapons from being banned. There are people who think we should not spend a lot of money on prevention programs to give our young people something to say yes to, instead of something to say no to. There are people who don't think it's important, but that crime bill gives 100,000 police to the streets of this country, a 20 percent increase. It makes our streets safer; it bans handgun ownership by minors; it has programs for safe schools; it has programs that will build more prisons and have three strikes and you're out for serious offenders and do more to help kids stay out of trouble. It is a good bill, and it should pass the United States Congress next week. We should stop fooling around with it. There are other families like Linda's family who deserve to have their streets safer and their futures better and brighter, and we ought to quit fooling around with it. And finally, let me say something about health care. You know, I get tickled at all these people who say that this health care bill is some big Government socialist scheme, that it's some horrible idea to take over a big part of our economy. Let me ask you something, folks. Here's a few questions, and I'd say the folks that aren't with us owe us some answers. Which country spends the most on health care? The United States. Which advanced country is the only one that doesn't provide health care coverage for everybody? The United States. Which is the only advanced country in the world where we're going in reverse, we're losing ground in health care coverage? The United States. Ten years ago, we had 88 percent of the people with insurance; now it's 83 percent. Today in America, there are 5 million, 5 million Americans, almost all of them working people and their children, who don't have insurance today who had it 5 years ago. Now, until we provide affordable private health insurance for all Americans, we are not going to be able to have a secure, stable family environment, work environment, offer people the chance to grow. What do they say about this health care plan? They say it's bad for small business. Well, let me ask you this&mdash;this is an interesting thing&mdash; why, if it's bad for small business, have 600,000 small businesses signed up to support our plan to require everybody to cover their employees and split the difference on the insurance premium? I'll tell you why, because most small businesses do provide health insurance to their employees, and they're getting ripped off today, they're paying too much for it. I met a farm family from western Oklahoma a couple of days ago when I gave their daughter an award. She's a young teenager who had a car wreck in 1990, paralyzed her from the chest down. She's spent the last 4 years trying to encourage people not to drink and drive, not to ride with drunk drivers, and always to put their seatbelts on&mdash;a marvelous girl. But the story this family told me was interesting: a Republican farmer from western Oklahoma, his wife, and their two beautiful daughters, one confined to a wheelchair. They've had almost no medical bills in the last 2 years. But they just got notice that in August, their health insurance premiums are going from $3,400 a year to $9,600 a year. And they are going to have to drop their health insurance. Now, this is not a partisan political issue. Anybody working that hard with two kids to educate, one of them with a serious illness&mdash;injury in the past, deserves affordable health insurance. The only State that has ever provided health care to all its citizens is Hawaii. For 20 years, employers and employees have had to provide health care. And you know what? Insurance premiums in Hawaii are 30 percent lower than they are in the rest of the country. We can do this. I am tired of people saying, we cannot do this, we cannot do that, we cannot do the other thing. The violent, extremist interests in this country that are trying to keep health care out of the reach of ordinary American working people are a disgrace to the American dream. Most of them have health care, and most of them have parents on Medicare. Why do they not want you to have the same thing that they have? Why? Why don't they want you to have what they can? Let them give up their health care and see how they like it. Now, folks, we're going to have to make some tough decisions here. I don't mind being a controversial figure. You didn't invite me to go to Washington to sit in the White House and warm the chair. We are changing this country. We are rebuilding the economy, we're taking on crime, we're taking on welfare reform, we're taking on health care, we're taking on the tough issues. But I cannot do it alone; you have to help. Support the Members of Congress. Tell them you want them to move on the crime bill. Tell them you want them to move on health care. Tell them a simple message: We are coming to the end of this century; we have got to keep the American dream alive. The only way to do it is to restore the economy, empower individuals to take advantage of it, and rebuild our communities and families. Let's make Government work for ordinary citizens again. That's what I'm fighting for. Thank you for being here to help me make the fight. God bless you.",clinton
"Thank you very much. I'm glad to be back in Michigan and glad to be back in Detroit. I'm glad to be on this stage with all these wonderful Democrats, and I thank them for the work they have done for your State and for your country. I also would like to say a special word of thanks to all the people of Michigan who have been so kind to me and to Hillary and to our administration, for the victory we won here in the primary in 1992 and in the general election, and since then, for all the work that has been done, including the wonderful host we had in Detroit in Mayor Archer, when we had the jobs conference here a few months ago. I thank you for that. Ladies and gentlemen, I ran for this job because I wanted to change this country. I was worried about the direction in which we were going. I thought the economy was going down, the deficit was going up, the country was coming apart, we were in danger of losing the American dream, and our Government wasn't working for ordinary people. I wanted to change all that. And after a year and a half, I can tell you that the change is well underway. A lot of people don't like it, and they've fought it every step of the way. When I try to unite people in Washington, there are always people there trying to divide us. When I try to talk in ordinary terms to ordinary people, there are always people there throwing around political hot air and divisive rhetoric. But I can tell you that we are moving forward. Since this administration took office, we have implemented a national economic strategy. We have launched a full-scale assault on crime. We have made a sweeping proposal on welfare reform. We have got bills to the floor of both Houses of Congress for the first time in the history of the United States to provide affordable health care to all Americans. And I want to point out, when I came to Michigan in 1992, people told me they wanted something done about this economy. When I offered our national economic plan to the Congress, I was told in a meeting by the congressional leaders of the other party that there would be no votes from the other party for the budget, no votes for the economic plan, that they would not help us to reverse 12 years of exploding deficits, declining investment, and a declining economy. And so, by the narrowest of margins, we passed that economic plan. And they said the sky would fall, the economy would collapse, the deficit would go up, jobs would be lost, the end of the world had come. Chicken Little was on the floor of the Senate and the House with an elephant pin on. What happened? We produced for the American people $255 billion in spending cuts, tax cuts for 15 million working families, including 392,000 working families in the State of Michigan. We did ask 1.2 percent of the wealthiest people in this country to pay more so we could pay the deficit down, including 41,000 families in Michigan, one-tenth the number who got a tax cut. We made 90 percent of the small businesses in this State and this Nation eligible for tax reductions if they invested more to grow this economy. We made 20 million Americans immediately eligible for lower interest rates and better repayment terms on their college loans. And what was the result? We're shrinking the Federal Government to its smallest point since Kennedy was President. We've got 3 years of deficit reduction in a row coming for the first time since Truman was President. We have 4.1 million new jobs, more jobs in a year and a half in Michigan than in the previous 4 years. We have a big drop in the unemployment rate, the largest number of new businesses formed in any single year since World War II. I plead guilty: We did it. I just want you to remember this: In this United States Senate race, if it had not been for Congressman Carr, the plan would have gone down. We passed it by one vote. His opponent is against what we did. He is still proud of what we did. If you like where the economy is going, elect Bob Carr to the United States Senate. Now, let me say, we're fighting for some other things. We're going to try to pass a crime bill next week. We have to get it to a vote first. The crime bill has some controversial provisions. And a lot of Americans and some Members of Congress, in good conscience, don't agree with them. But it will put 100,000 police on the street. It will give the police a better chance to compete, because it eliminates assault weapons while protecting over 650 other hunting and sporting weapons from being fooled with, which I know is important. It says minors can't own or possess handguns unless they're under the supervision of an adult, which I think is very important. It provides funds for safe streets. It provides tougher penalties for repeat offenders, money for the States to build prisons, but money for prevention programs to give our children something to say yes to, as well as something to say no to. And we need to pass it because the security of our families and our communities and our workplaces and our schools demand it. You know, I met a woman from Michigan out at the airport. She came to see me with her two children. Her husband was murdered in his workplace last year. He was taken to the hospital and died. And after he died, she got a $24,000 bill from the emergency room. And because her husband was a small business person who couldn't afford to buy insurance, they didn't have any health insurance. So there she was, a widow with two little kids and a $24,000 bill. In 1943, Congressman Dingell's father introduced the first bill to provide affordable health care to all Americans. In 1945, '47, and '49, Harry Truman tried to do it. And now, here we are in 1994. We're the only country in the world with an advanced economy that doesn't provide health care to everybody. You've got the automobile industry in Michigan losing jobs and market share because they got $1,000 in every car in health care, and they're paying for the cost of people who won't even pay their own way. There are 5 million working people in America, almost all of them working people and their children, who had health insurance 5 years ago who don't have it today. We're going in reverse. We have a clear example in the State of Hawaii, where for 20 years the employers and employees have all had to buy health insurance, where small businesses have premiums that are 30 percent below the national average. People are healthier, they're doing better, and the small business community is doing better. And we are determined to see that we do not walk away from this. Let me tell you, when we started this health care debate, there were two dozen Senators from the other party on a bill that would provide health care to all Americans. Today, there are zero there. Every time we have moved to them, they have run the other way. It is time to stop playing politics with the health care of the people of the United States of America. Now, I knew we had to make some changes in our plan, and we did. We made it less bureaucratic, more voluntary, gave bigger breaks to small business, and we phase it in over a longer period of time. That's what the bills now before Congress do. But the issue is this: Are we going to keep spending more than everybody else and getting less for it, or are we going to continue to let more and more money go to insurance companies and bureaucracies instead of to keep people healthy, or are we going to run the risk of imperiling this fabulous recovery in the auto industry and this recovery in the economy, or are we going to keep punishing the small business people who do provide health insurance? Or are we going to do what's right for the American people? That is the issue. It should not be a partisan political issue. In this election year we ought to forget about the election and remember the people who elected us in the first place and take care of their needs. And let me make one final remark to you about my friend, your nominee for Governor. For 12 years I had the honor of being the Governor of my State. It was an incredible experience. And I learned a few things about doing it. And I'll tell you, if you want to succeed over the long run, you have to recognize, number one, a lot of these problems cannot be solved in Washington. I can put in place good economic policies, good health care policies, good education policies, good anticrime policies, but still, in the statehouses and in the city halls, the shape of the future will be determined by the quality of the people who are elected. The President cannot do it; the Congress cannot do it. It matters. The second thing I want to tell you is Governors understand that partisan politics doesn't have much to do with whether kids get educated, jobs get created, streets are safer, if you're doing your job right. You need someone who can unify people; someone who believes that we don't have a person to waste, that we cannot afford to be divided; someone who will tell you hard truths but tell you hard truths in a way that will bring us together, not tear us apart; and you also need someone with an eye on the future. This man I know well. He was the first member of your delegation to endorse my candidacy. I hope that doesn't hurt him here this year. And I can tell you, he will be a Governor you can be proud of. He will unite the people of this State, not divide them. And he will always be thinking about the future. We are living in a time when the average person will change jobs seven times in a lifetime. We cannot afford people to ever, ever, ever forget about the fact that politics can never be about what works in the moment. We have to be thinking about tomorrow. So I say to you: I want you to elect him Governor. I want you to elect Bob Carr Senator. I want you to return these Members of the House delegation, without whom this economic recovery would not be underway. Every one of them will be attacked by their Republican opponents as being the same old tax-and-spend, blah, blah, blah, blah. The truth is, the crowd that was in there before in all the Reagan years and the Bush years, they cut taxes on the rich, raised taxes on the middle class, exploded the deficit, and the economy went downhill, and ignored things like what was happening to the auto industry. We have an economic strategy. It includes fair taxation, but we're bringing the deficit down, investing in education and training, building the economy, and looking toward the future. I think that's what the American people want us to do. If they know what the record is, these people will all be returned. You make sure they know. Thank you, and God bless you.",clinton
"Thank you. Thank you very much, Senator Graham. Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you'll forgive me. I have my annual August ragweed voice. If you don't have allergies and you can't tell whether ragweed has come out in Washington, DC, you just wait for me to get my sort of, you know, raspy&mdash;surely there's a role for me in the movies when I talk like this. I could be the guy that delivers the bad news, and that wouldn't be any role change I would have to take. I want to thank many people. I thank the incumbent Senators who are here, Senator Graham and the others who have worked so hard. I also want to congratulate the nominees who are here. We have an exceptionally outstanding group of people: Bob Carr, Alan Wheat, Tom Andrews, Sam Coppersmith, Jim Cooper, all from the House of Representatives, and former Congressman Jim Jontz, all of whom have real records of fighting for the interests of ordinary Americans in trying to build this country and all of whom have a real chance to be elected to the United States Senate if we work hard for them. Joel Hyatt from Ohio is not here tonight, but he and I were in law school together. He's younger than I am. Most people are these days. And those who aren't look younger now. Joel Hyatt began a program when we were in law school for undergraduates to tutor innercity kids and then went on to become famous by making legal representation available to ordinary middle class folks. The program he started when we were in law school is still operating there, a real tribute to his capacity to innovate. Richard Fisher from Texas is also not here tonight, but he is another longtime friend of mine who worked with me in the Democratic Leadership Council and tried to bring new ideas into the party. And believe it or not, in Texas, no matter how much the Republicans crow, he's got an excellent chance to win there, and we're going to work hard for him. The attorney general of Delaware is here, Charles Oberly, who&mdash;now, that's the job I used to have. That's the best job I ever had. I don't know why he wants to be in the Senate. When you're attorney general, you don't have to hire people or fire them, except your own staff; you don't have to raise taxes or cut spending; and when you do things that are unpopular, you can blame it on the Constitution. Nonetheless, he wants to leave that wonderful institution. And we were together in Delaware a few months ago. It was apparent to me, not only from what I read in the Delaware papers but from what I saw of him on the stump and the reaction of the people of Delaware, that he had an excellent chance to win that race. I also want to note the presence here of Jack Mudd from Montana who, like me, was a law professor. But unlike me, he became the youngest law school dean in America. And it hasn't seemed to do him much harm; he's here running for the Senate. Everybody I know in Montana believes that he has a great chance to win. That State went Democratic in the last election. And it's a very tightly fought State, a very closely contested one, but I think he's got an excellent chance to win. I'd like to mention three other folks who are here, two from the State legislature, Linda Kushner of Rhode Island and Ken Harper of Mississippi, and Pat Shea of Utah who used to be counsel for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a committee that I worked for when I was trying to work myself through college here in the 1960's. I have had the occasion to meet and be with all three of them over the years, and I highly recommend them to all of you. Most of you have heard me speak before. The last thing you need to hear is me give another speech, except when I'm hoarse. But I want to make a couple of points. I ran for President as an underdog, as a challenger. I was buried two or three times before the final vote came in. One of the things that I know is that you can't win a race unless you want to win for something bigger than yourself and that if you do want to win for something bigger than yourself, you have always got a chance to win. I know that you can't win in a tough time if you don't fight, but if you do fight, you're always in the race. And I know that the American people are basically ambivalent about most things in their politics today. I think it is largely because of the time in which we live. And I think it is an enormous opportunity for us to show conviction and direction. And I might say&mdash;I don't want to single out just one of the Senators here, but I am very, very proud of the conviction, direction, and strength that Chuck Robb is showing in his heroic fight to be reelected to the United States Senate from Virginia. And I want to begin with a story from one of his debates, and then I'll end with another one to illustrate what this election is all about. When I entered the race for President in late 1991, when President Bush was at 70 percent approval in the polls and most people, aside from my mother, thought I had lost my mind, I did it because I was very worried that this National Government had become more about words than deeds and that we had become addicted to seeing the Presidents always worried about how they were positioned, rather than what they were doing, and that we were moving toward the 21st century at a breathtaking pace with the economy going down, the deficit going up, the middle class being squeezed&mdash;genuinely in danger of losing our position of energy and leadership and direction in the world. It seemed to me that to keep the American dream alive, we had to do some simple things that were not being done. We had to restore the economy, empower individuals to compete and win in it, rebuild our communities and support our families, and make Government work for ordinary people again. When I started running for President&mdash;I was looking out there&mdash;Jerry McEntee came out for me fairly early, and a lot of people thought he had lost his mind, because some people said, Well, Clinton's not enough of a Democrat; he's always working with Republicans and trying to get things done. I plead guilty: I did that. I was even popular with the previous administration until I filed. I believed, you know, that we had all these problems that did not fit very neatly within the categories that the Democrats and the Republicans had used in the past, and I still believe that. But I want to tell you what the problem is and why these races are so important with two stories. I'll begin and end with one. The one I'll begin with was from Senator Robb's first debate on the Larry King show. The other three guys were just pounding, you know, and Marshall Coleman looked at him and said, You come from conservative Virginia, and you pretend to be a conservative, but you are one of the top 10 Democrats supporting Bill Clinton in the United States Senate. Chuck Robb looked at Marshall Coleman and smiled, and he said, Yep, and I was one of the top 10 Democrats supporting George Bush in the United States Senate. I do not believe the purpose of politics is to destroy the President, and I've finally got somebody who is trying to get the deficit down instead of just talk about it, and so I supported him. And I never will forget that. Now, what's that got to do with anything? You have to decide what the purpose of your public life is. Is it to do things that genuinely respond to the needs of people, or is it to posture? You remember one of the Republican House Members that's leaving the House, Fred Grandy, said the other day that his colleagues had been told not to work with us on health care. Senator Dole was quoted a few weeks ago as saying, well, he understood that some of the Republican Senators wanted to work with us on health care and work something out, but I've got a party to think of. Now, all I know is, when we showed up here, the deficit was going up and the economy was going down. And with no help from them, we passed an economic program that cut spending by $255 billion, cut taxes on 15 million working Americans, made 90 percent of the small businesses eligible for tax cuts, raised taxes on 1.2 percent of the people but devoted all the money to paying the deficit down, made 20 million Americans eligible to refinance their college loans at a lower interest rate. And not a one of them helped us. They said the sky would fall. They said the deficit would go up and the economy would go down. I never heard so much Chicken Little talk in my life as we heard a year ago this month. And they all talked about how we were the tax-and-spend party and they were against big government. You just remember this: The Democrats alone, with not a single, solitary vote from the opposition party, adopted a budget which will shrink the Federal Government to fewer than 2 million people for the first time since John Kennedy was President&mdash;something they say they're for but couldn't or wouldn't do&mdash;that will give us 3 years of deficit reduction in a row for the first time since Harry Truman was President&mdash;something they said they were for but couldn't or wouldn't do&mdash;and has produced 4.1 million new jobs in 18 months. Now, that's why I want these people to win, not because I am an abject partisan&mdash;my whole record shows that I'm always willing to work with people from the other side&mdash;but because the voters have to send a message to all of us that they expect problems to be solved. If the message they send is they'd rather have hot air than firm action to advance the cause of middle class people, then the Democrats will start behaving the same way. We must keep our eyes on doing things, and then we need to stand up and do them. Today I had the pleasure of presenting the Presidential Medal of Freedom to nine distinguished Americans, one of whom was Barbara Jordan from Texas, and I wish she were here tonight. She said, I just don't get it. You can just imagine. She said, The Democrats have a wonderful record; what they need is to fight for it. Barbara Jordan said that. We need this crime bill. It's being held up by people who know if it comes to a vote, it'll pass overwhelmingly. So they think they can beat it on a technicality&mdash;and the American people won't understand it&mdash;called a rule. It's the House equivalent of the filibuster: Beat it, but act like you're not. The Democrats have put together a bill the Republicans said they were for for 6 years but couldn't produce, that every one of us can be proud of: 100,000 more police, a 20 percent increase; tougher penalties; a ban on assault weapons; a ban on ownership of handguns by children; and billions of dollars in prevention programs to give our kids something to say yes to. We cannot walk away from it. In the health care debate, we have on the floor of both Houses of Congress, for the first time in the history of the Republic, bills that would provide health care to all Americans&mdash; never been done before, never even got on the floor before. And yes, there's a lot of controversy about it. There's a lot of information and a lot of misinformation, some genuine difference of opinion. But we do know some things about which there is no dispute. And the burden should be, therefore, on those who have no plan. We know we spend more on health care than anybody else, 40 percent more of our income. We know that even though we do that, we're the only country in the world with an advanced economy that hasn't figured out how to cover everybody. We know that we're the only country going in reverse. There are 5 million Americans today, almost all of them working Americans and their children, who don't have insurance who did have insurance just 5 years ago. That's not happening anywhere else in the world, only here. So by what reasoning is it that we say, This is good that we spend 40 percent more than anybody else, do less? We're the only ones losing ground, and we spend billions and billions on paperwork, bureaucracy, and administrative costs that no one else spends. We say we are a pragmatic people. But we know that in Hawaii, small business insurance rates are 30 percent lower than the rest of the country because everybody's covered and everybody bears some of the burden. Should we try something else? I'm willing to try something else for 4 or 5 years. I think it ought to be phased in. I think we ought to be careful. I think we ought to give the market a chance to work. But I think we also should not walk away from what we know works. The main thing I want to tell you is this: When we enter this debate, what I hope it will be about is the health care of the American people, their pocketbooks, the pocketbook of the Federal Government, the quality of care, the ability to choose your doctors, and the ability to meet the legitimate needs of middle class working people, and not politics. Last week&mdash;and this is the story I want to end with&mdash;last week I had the honor of doing something that Presidents have done for 44 years: that is to present awards every year, with the Attorney General, to four young Americans who have either shown great heroism or great public service. One of the public service winners was a young woman from Keyes, Oklahoma, who was paralyzed in 1990 from the chest down in a car accident and since then has spent her time trying to organize children not to drink and drive, not to ride with people who drink and drive, and always to wear their seatbelts. In other words, instead of being bitter, this beautiful child is trying to make sure other people don't have the experience she did. And so there I was, just totally captivated with this young woman and her little sister and her fine father and mother. And her daddy was a farmer from Keyes, Oklahoma, way out in western Oklahoma. And we just got to talking about health care. And he said, You know, I was paying $3,400 a year for a limited policy. And my daughter's bills, they were all over 2 years ago. We hadn't had any bills in 2 years. But they told me I had used up my wellness quotient, and my premium is going to $9,600 in 2 weeks. So in 2 weeks, we'll be out of insurance. And he said&mdash;he tickled me&mdash;he said, It's not a political deal. He said, I'm a Republican, Mr. President. But he said, If somebody's working as hard as I'm working and can't even have health insurance for their kids, something is wrong somewhere. And so as we begin this debate, there are legitimate differences of approach. I welcome them. Nobody's smart enough to know everything about this issue. But let us remember that farmer from Keyes, Oklahoma, and his fine wife and his two beautiful daughters and ask ourselves, how will he send them to college if he can't even pay their health insurance? And when we go into these fall elections, let us proudly say, Yes, we're Democrats. And when they attack us for being tax-and-spend, say, We cut taxes on 10 times as many people as we raised them on. You guys had a bigger Government than we're having. We're just trying to solve the problems of the people of the country. We put 100,000 police on the street without a tax increase, by shrinking the Federal bureaucracy. We can win the partisan debates if we'll fight. But the main thing we need to do is to remember that this is a difficult and confusing time for our people. The cold war is over. We're moving to a new era. It has not been defined. Every time this happens, the American people become vulnerable. At the end of World War I, we were vulnerable to the first Red scare and to the Ku Klux Klan. At the end of World War II, the same thing happened all over again. The only difference was Harry Truman gladly let his popularity drop from 80 percent to 36 percent to keep our eye on the ball, to rebuild the country and recapture the rest of the world. And in the end, the American people worked through their confusion and came back to their better nature. And they will now if we can make this election about them, not about an argument between Republicans and Democrats, not about all these rhetorical hard balls. Let's just stand up and defend what we've done, defend what we believe in, and fight for the American people. If we do, the crowd we've got in this room can win these elections in November. Thank you, and God bless you.",clinton
"Thank you very much, Secretary Rubin and Ambassador Kantor. Ladies and gentlemen, we wanted to be here today to make the clearest public case we can for the proposal which has been developed by the administration and the bipartisan leadership in Congress for dealing with the present situation. We have worked hard with an extraordinary group of people who have joined forces because all of us realize how important this proposal is, not only to the people of Mexico but also to the United States and to our workers. We are acting to support the Mexican economy and to protect and promote the interests of the American people. As Ambassador Kantor said, and as all of you know very well, we live in an increasingly global economy in which people, products, ideas, and money travel across national borders with lightning speed. We've worked hard to help our workers take advantage of that economy by getting our own economic house in order, by expanding opportunities for education and training, and by expanding the frontiers of trade, by doing what we could to make sure there was more free and fair trade for Americans. And we know, and all of you know, that those efforts are creating high wage jobs for our people that would otherwise not be there. Our goal, our vision must be to create a global economy of democracies with free market, not government-run, economies; democracies that practice free and fair trade, that give themselves a chance to develop and become more prosperous, while giving our own people the opportunity they deserve to reap the benefits of highquality, high-productivity American labor, in terms of more jobs and higher incomes. We have pursued this goal with vision and with discipline, through NAFTA, through the Summit of the Americas, through a number of other international endeavors like GATT and the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation group. But we have pursued it especially here in our own hemisphere, where we are blessed to see every nation but one governed in a democratic fashion and a genuine commitment to free market economics and to more open trade. We have to know that the future on this path is plainly the right one, but as with any path, it cannot be free of difficulties. We have to make decisions based on a determined devotion to the idea of what we are pursuing over the long run. We know that, given the volatility of the economic situation in the globe now, there can be developments that for the movement are beyond the control of any of our trading partners, themselves developing nations, which could threaten this vision and threaten the interests of the American people. Mexico's present financial difficulty is a very good case in point. Of course, it's a danger to Mexico, but as has already been said, it is plainly also a danger to the economic future of the United States. NAFTA helped us to dramatically increase our exports of goods and services. It helped us to create more than 100,000 jobs here at home through increased exports to Mexico. But over the long run, it means even more. It means even more opportunities with Mexico. It means the integration of the rest of Latin America and the Caribbean into an enormous basket of opportunities for us in the future. And we cannot&mdash;we cannot let this momentary difficulty cause us to go backward now. That's why, together with the congressional leadership, I am working so hard to urge Congress to pass an important and necessary package to back private sector loans to Mexico with a United States Government guarantee. Let me say, I am very gratified by the leadership shown in the Congress on both sides of the aisle. By helping to put Mexico back on track, this package will support American exports, secure our jobs, help us to better protect our borders and to safeguard democracy and economic stability in our hemisphere, because America and American workers are more secure when we support a strong and growing market for our exports, because America and American workers are more secure when we help the Mexican people to see the prospect of decent jobs and a secure future at home through a commitment to free-market economics, political democracy, and growing over the long term, and because we're more secure when more and more other countries also enjoy the benefits of democracy and economic opportunity, and perhaps most important over the long run, because we are more secure if we help Mexico to remain a strong and stable model for economic development around our hemisphere and throughout the world. If we fail to act, the crisis of confidence in Mexico's economy could spread to other emerging countries in Latin America and in Asia, the kinds of markets that buy our goods and services today and that will buy far more of them in the future. Developing these markets is plainly in the interests of the American people. We must act to make sure that we maintain the kind of opportunities now being seized by the Secretary of Commerce and the delegation of American business leaders who have had such a successful trip to India. If you take Mexico, just consider the extraordinary progress made in recent years. Mexico erased a budget deficit that once equalled 15 percent of its gross domestic product. It slashed inflation from 145 percent a year to single digits. It sold off inefficient state enterprises, dramatically reduced its foreign debt, opened virtually every market to global competition. This is proof that the Mexican Government and the Mexican people are willing to make decisions that are good for the long run; even if it entails some short-term sacrifice for them, they know where their future prosperity and opportunity lie. Now Mexico, of course, will have to demonstrate even greater discipline to work itself out of the current crisis. Let me say, though, it's important that we understand what's happened. And the Secretary of Treasury and I and a lot of others spent a lot of time trying to make sure we understood exactly what had happened before we recommended a course of action. It is clear that this crisis came about because Mexico relied too heavily upon short-term foreign loans to pay for the huge upsurge in its imports from the United States and from other countries. A large amount of those debts came due at a time when, because of the nature of the debts, it caused a serious cash flow problem for Mexico, much like a family that expects to pay for a new home with the proceeds from the sale of its old house only to have the sale fall through. Now, together with the leadership of both Houses, our administration has forged a plan that makes available United States Government guarantees to secure private sector loans to Mexico. The leadership in Congress from both sides of the aisle and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board developed this plan with us. It is something we did together because we knew it was important, important enough to the strategic interest of the United States to do it in lockstep and to urge everyone without regard to party or region of the country or short-term interests to take the long view what is good for America and our working people. We all agree that something had to be done. Now, these guarantees, it's important to note, are not foreign aid. They are not a gift. They are not a bailout. They are not United States Government loans. They will not affect our current budget situation. Rather they are the equivalent of cosigning a note, a note that Mexico can use to borrow money on its own account. And because the guarantees are clearly not entirely risk-free to the United States, Mexico will make an advanced payment to us, like an insurance premium. No guarantees will be issued until we are satisfied that Mexico can provide the assured means of repayment. As soon as the situation in Mexico is fully stabilized, we expect Mexico to start borrowing once again from the private markets without United States Government guarantees. The U.S. has extended loans and loan guarantees many, many times before to many different countries. In fact, we've had a loan mechanism in place with Mexico since 1941. And Mexico has always made good on its obligations. Now, there will be tough conditions here to make sure that any private money loaned to Mexico on the basis of our guarantees is well and wisely used. Our aim in imposing the conditions, I want to make clear, is not to micromanage Mexico's economy or to infringe in any way on Mexico's sovereignty but simply to act responsibly and effectively so that we can help to get Mexico's economic house back in order. I know some say we should not get involved. They say America has enough trouble at home to worry about what's going on somewhere else. There are others who may want to get involved in too much detail to go beyond what the present situation demands or what is appropriate. But we must see this for what it is. This is not simply a financial problem for Mexico; this is an American challenge. Mexico is our third largest trading partner already. The livelihoods of thousands and thousands of our workers depend upon continued strong export growth to Mexico. That's why we must reach out and not retreat. With the bipartisan leadership of Congress, I am asking the new Congress to cast a vote, therefore, for the loan guarantee program as a vote for America's workers and America's future. It is vital to our interests. It is vital to our ability to shape the kind of world that I think we all know we have to have. No path to the future&mdash;let me say again&mdash; in a time when many decisions are beyond the immediate control of any national government, much less that of a developing nation, no path to the future can be free of difficulty. Not every stone in a long road can be seen from the first step. But if we are on the right path, then we must do this. Our interests demand it. Our values support it, and it is good for our future. Let me say again that the coalition of forces supporting this measure is significant; it may be historic. The new Republican leaders in Congress, the leadership of the Democratic Party in Congress, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, why are they doing this? And I might say, I was immediately impressed by how quickly every person I called about this said, Clearly, we have to act. They instinctively knew the stakes. Now in the public debate questions should be properly asked and properly answered. But let us not forget what the issue is. Let us not read too little into this moment or try to load it up with too many conditions unrelated to the moment. The time is now to act. It is in our interest. It is imperative to our future. I hope all of you will do what you can to take that message to the Congress and to the American people. Thank you very much.",clinton
"Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary. After that kind introduction I'm loath to say what I was about to say, which is I'm afraid the headline on this story will be Reich comes out for playing hard. But I think people who work hard should also be able to play hard. I want to thank Paul Wood for his story and Marvin Clarke for his testimony in his long battle to make sure the country did something to help people so that there wouldn't be other people in the situation he finds himself in. I want to thank the steelworkers and the senior citizens groups and all the others who were mentioned by Secretary Reich. I'd like to especially thank someone who is not here, my longtime friend J.J. Pickle, who retired from the Congress and who left this as his last legacy in a long career of helping people with their own lives. I'd like to thank another longtime friend of mine who is still here&mdash;that's maybe a disability in this town, but Marty Slate has done a wonderful job at the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. I'll never forget the first time Hillary told me about Marty Slate. She said, That's the smartest guy I ever met in my life. He'll find a way to solve any kind of problem. And you have done a fine job, and we're grateful to you. And I'd like to thank someone whose name I don't know and I've been trying to find out before this moment. I'd like to thank the person in the Richmond debate in 1992 who asked President Bush and Ross Perot and Bill Clinton about the problems of underfunded pensions and first got my attention on this issue. I wish&mdash; I don't know who that person was, but I am deeply indebted, and now so are several million other Americans, to that person for bringing this issue personally to me in a very direct way. Two years ago from tomorrow, I became President, with a commitment to try to restore the American dream for all Americans and to make sure that we enter the next century as the strongest country in the world, a force for peace and freedom and democracy, but most important of all, as one which in a very different world would keep the American dream alive for all of our people. When I signed the Retirement Protection Act into law last month, it was almost completely unnoticed because at the end of the year it had to go through in the comprehensive legislation that involved the passage of the GATT trade agreement. And we wanted to do this today because this act was so profoundly important to so many millions of Americans and it says a lot about what we are trying to do here in Washington. This is part of a new economic policy designed to help the American people stay ahead in a world economy that is changing so rapidly that, while it offers vast new benefits to people, it also is very frightening to a lot of people and causes too much insecurity and unsettling for people who have worked hard and done the right things all their lives. It gives the American taxpayers a more effective, more efficient, and more disciplined Government. And this bill furthers what I have called my own contract with America, the New Covenant. It says that people who act responsibly should be rewarded. The Retirement Protection Act says that people deserve a pension system that they rely on. They deserve employers who take actions to be worthy of their own trust and the labor that they give them, year-in and year-out. They deserve a Government that will protect them and stand by them, a Government that is their partner. It says to employers that they can no longer gamble with the retirement savings of their own employees, allowing pension plans to become dangerously underfunded, expecting taxpayers to bail them out. It means that responsible businesses with well-funded plans will no longer have to carry an unfair share of the burden of the insurance costs for businesses who do not do the same. As a result of the new law, the funding level of large, underfunded pension plans will be increased dramatically so that the benefits can be paid as they were promised. The National Pension Insurance System will remain secure. Employees will get better information warning them when their plans could be at risk. In stabilizing the Federal insurance system, we used the power of Government to avert a potential crisis, protecting millions of retirees, corporate pension plans, and the taxpayers from huge potential losses. Today we can be grateful that the security of our pensions are strong and growing stronger, thanks to the Retirement Protection Act and the work of all of you in this room who did so much to make it happen. Thank you very, very much.",clinton
"Good morning, everyone. I'm delighted to be joined this morning by Senator Nickles, Senator Ford, Senator Lieberman, Senator Grassley, and Senator Glenn and by Congressman Armey, Congressman Fazio, Congressman Shays, Congressman Gutknecht, and also by former Congressman Dick Swett and former Speaker Foley, who were instrumental in supporting this legislation in the previous session of the Congress where it passed the House but not the Senate. Let me say that I am extremely pleased, and I think the American people are extremely pleased, that we are beginning the new year with a reform that requires Congress to live under the laws it imposes on the American people. I'm encouraged that we've begun this year with the White House and Congress, with Republicans and Democrats working together on a reform that has long been needed. Most Americans are actually surprised when they learn that some of our most basic laws don't apply to Congress and their staffs. This legislation ensures that we'll change that. It guarantees that the cafeteria workers and the police who work in Congress and who help millions of tourists every year will have the same rights as all Americans do to a safe environment, to collective bargaining, to civil rights protection. It does something else that's very important. Over the years, Washington has too often isolated itself from the everyday experience of ordinary Americans. It's become remote from the consequences of the actions Congress takes. I want to end this. Congress clearly wants to end this. Now when Congress passes a law, it will immediately know the consequences of the law if it affects private employers as well. This will help us reconnect Government to the lives of ordinary Americans. That's why I supported this change when I ran for President and why I have supported it as President. It will help us to do what we must do to continue to fight to bring a reality check to Washington. That's why I worked to cut the White House staff, to eliminate the executive dining rooms, to cut back the widespread use of Government limousines, to reduce the deficit, to shrink the Federal bureaucracy to its smallest size in 30 years. I'll admit that last year when this reform didn't pass I was disappointed. But I am very happy today. I want to thank all the Senators who are here, Senators Lieberman, Glenn, and Grassley, Senator Nickles, for what they all did. I thank Congressman Shays and Congressman Hoyer, who is not here, and the other Members of the House for all the work that they did. And again I say, I thank those who worked on this last year when it passed the House. Already this year, Congress has enacted other important reforms, like reducing the staff and the number of committees. I want to congratulate the Members of Congress on these steps and, in particular, Majority Leader Dole and Speaker Gingrich, the Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle, and the House Democratic leader, Dick Gephardt. These changes I hope are the beginning of something that will continue for the next several years. We must use this impetus to make much deeper changes in the culture of Washington that has too often disconnected it from ordinary Americans. The American people, for example, know that lobbyists frequently get access to Congress they can never hope to get. They know the voices of special interests still sometimes ring too loud. They know too much of what goes on here goes on behind closed doors. Congress should ban the practice of gifts and meals and travels and entertainment from lobbyists. It should pass the strongest possible version of the line-item veto, lobby disclosure reform, and real comprehensive campaign finance reform. I want to discuss these matters in detail tomorrow evening, but this is a job we must finish. This bill demonstrates the common resolve of people here that those in power should not lose touch with those who sent them here. Now we've got to go on. We must make this system more open, more fair, and less elitist. That's the goal we all share. I look forward to working with all of the Members here and all the Members of the Congress in both parties to achieve that goal. Now I want to get on with signing the bill.",clinton

"On behalf of the American people, it is my honor to congratulate Muslims around the world on the occasion of the Eid Al-Fitr. Whether native-born or immigrants from Africa, the Middle East, Asia, or Europe, Muslims now represent an increasingly important element in the tapestry of American society. Because of the growth of Islam in our country, American citizens of all faiths are coming to appreciate the significance of Ramadan as Muslims fast, pray, and rededicate themselves to the teachings of the Qur'an. United in faith, America's Muslims are also united in their commitment to building a society rich in diversity and grounded in mutual respect. I believe America is made stronger by the core values of Islam&mdash;commitment to family, compassion for the disadvantaged, and respect for difference. There is special significance this year as the three Abrahamic faiths all celebrate holidays in the span of the same week. As Jews celebrate Hanukkah, Christians celebrate Christmas, and now Muslims celebrate Eid Al-Fitr. The Qur'an, the Bible, and the Torah all call on believers to love one's neighbors and to welcome strangers. The Qur'an tells us that we are all People of the Book and that we share a common humanity and dignity. As the appearance of the new moon brings to a close this holy month, we all pray that it will usher in a year of reconciliation and peace. The First Lady and I wish all Muslims a blessed celebration of the Eid Al-Fitr and peace, health, and prosperity in the years ahead. Eid mubarak. BILL CLINTON",clinton
"<centerBy the President of the United States of America<br<bA Proclamation</b</center Thurgood Marshall, an African-American born and reared in segregated America, was a fundamental force of change in this Nation. Perhaps no other American lawyer has had more impact on the current meaning and content of the U.S. Constitution. As the leading attorney for the N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense and Education Fund, Justice Marshall's twenty-nine victories before the U.S. Supreme Court breathed life into the text of the Fourteenth Amendment and guaranteed all Americans equality and liberty in their individual choices concerning voting, housing, education, and travel. As an appeals court judge, the Solicitor General of the United States and, finally, Supreme Court Justice, he worked tirelessly to expand and protect his vision of justice for America. As our Nation begins to chart its course for the next century, it is fitting that we pause to honor and remember the courageous, purposeful life of Thurgood Marshall.As a mark of respect for the memory of Thurgood Marshall, former Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, I hereby order by the authority vested in me as President of the United States of America by section 175 of title 36 of the United States Code, that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff upon all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and Possessions until his interment. I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same length of time at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations.In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day of January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-three, and of the Independence of the United States of American the two hundred and seventeenth.<img src=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/images/signatures/42.jpg<brWILLIAM J.

I ask that every American help as we attempt, in the words of the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope and transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood.We must always remember that the essence of our democracy is the recognition that we are united in a common purpose, working toward a common good.In renewing our commitment to fellowship throughout our great Nation, we recall the spirit of Thomas Jefferson, who said on the occasion of his first inaugural address, Let us, then, fellow citizens, unite with one heart and one mind. Let us restore to social intercourse that harmony and affection without which liberty and even life itself are but dreary things.Now, Therefore, I, William J. Clinton, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 22, 1993, a National Day of Fellowship and Hope and call upon the citizens of this great Nation to reflect on their obligations to their fellow Americans and look forward to the challenges of the new year with a spirit of hope.In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred seventeenth.<img src=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/images/signatures/42.jpg<brWILLIAM J.

"Thank you very much. Let me, first of all, thank Prime Minister Blair, First Minister Trimble, Deputy First Minister Mallon, for their strong leadership and their kind and generous remarks today. I am delighted to be with them, Cherie, Mrs. Trimble, my longtime friend John Hume; Senator George Mitchell, who is here; the Members of the Parliament in Northern Ireland; the Members of the United States Congress and the American delegation over here to my right. I thank Chris Gibson of the Civic Forum and many others who helped to make this day possible. Hillary, Chelsea, and I are delighted to be back in Northern Ireland, and here. I also can't help noting that this magnificent new arena is new since I was last here in '98&mdash; a new team, a new sport, a new facility, a new Northern Ireland. I want to thank the Belfast Giants for letting us use the arena tonight. I understand they don't treat their opponents as kindly as me, and I thank them for that. Thank you. Believe it or not, I actually read in the press this reference that said that since I'll be out of work soon&mdash;&mdash;that if I can skate and shoot and I'm not very expensive, the Giants would consider offering me a position. Well, I'm used to absorbing blows, but that's about the only qualification I have. Senator Mitchell, however, comes from Maine, where they play hockey all the time, and I think you should consider offering him a position. He is very well suited for it. Let me say to all of you, I have been honored to be involved in the quest for peace here for almost 8 years now. It has been not a passing interest but a passion for me and my administration and, as many of you know, for my family as well. And I want to say a special word of thanks to my wife and to the women here in Northern Ireland who have worked with her through the Vital Voices program and other things to try to make a contribution to the peace. I came here 5 years ago for the first time. Now I am back on my third visit. No other American President can say that. I want you to know that I'm here not just because I have Irish roots, like millions of Americans, and not simply because I love the land and the people. I believe in the peace you are building. I believe there can be no turning back. I believe you are committed to that. And I think it's very important that people the world over see what you are doing and support you along the way. Some of you may know, I left Dublin yesterday, and I had to drive to Dundalk for this rally we had last night&mdash;and there were one or two people there. We had this vast crowd of enthusiastic supporters of the peace. And because the weather was too bad for me to helicopter there and I drove, apparently, some people thought I was going to drive from there to Belfast. So I want to give a special word of thanks to the thousands of people in Armagh who waited along the road. I'm sorry I wasn't there. If I'd known you were there, I would have been there. But thank you for supporting the peace process. Let me say to the leaders who are here and the others who were involved with the development of the Good Friday accord back in 1998, I remember it very well. I remember how hard Prime Ministers Blair and Ahern, and George Mitchell, and all the leaders here worked on the Good Friday accord. I remember time and time again being called, saying that this or that problem had arisen and maybe the agreement couldn't be reached. And just before dawn on Good Friday, when the final momentum was building, one of your leaders said to me in a very tired voice&mdash;I'll never forget it&mdash;This is a life-and-death meeting. And then he added, But we'll make it happen. When they did, I remember saying to that person, Go and claim your moment. That is what I have to say today. After the Good Friday accord was reached, the people of Northern Ireland sealed it in an overwhelming vote for peace. And so I say, it is still for you to claim your moment. Look what has happened: a local government representing all the people; everyday problems addressed by local ministers who answer to local citizens&mdash;across party lines, I might add, as I have personally witnessed; an Executive that has adopted a budget and a program of government; and along the way, all the sort of messy squabbles and fights that you expect in a democracy. I mean, look at us; we've been doing it in America for 224 years, and as you might have noticed, we still have these minor disagreements from time to time. I ask you to remember this. The difficulties of sharing power in a free, peaceful democratic system are nothing compared to the difficulties of not having any power at all or of living with constant insecurity and violence. It's easy to overlook that. When people are in war, they measure the progress by counting victims. When people are involved in peaceful endeavors, it's easy to forget to measure, because the measurement is in pain avoided. How many children are alive today in Northern Ireland because deaths from sectarian violence are now a small fraction of what they were before the Good Friday accords? How many precious days of normality have been&mdash;&mdash; [At this point, there was a disruption in the audience.] Tell you what, I'll make you a deal: I'll listen to you, if you let me finish. Thank you. Thank you. [The audience interruption continued.] I think he rejected the deal. I'll tell you what. I'll make you a deal. I'll ignore him if you will. Thank you. How many days of normality have you gained because the checkpoints on the border aren't there anymore, because honest people can go to a pub or a school or a church without the burden of a search or the threat of a bomb? You have spent so many years mourning your losses. I hope you will now celebrate with pride and defend with passion the progress you have made. Just look at this arena here. Ten years ago I'm not sure you could have gotten the investment necessary to build this arena or to revitalize the entire Laganside area. But over the 5 years just passed, as hopes for peace have grown, the economy has grown, manufacturing up 27 percent, foreign investment almost 70 percent, the number of American firms growing from 40 to 100, 22,000 new jobs there alone, more people coming in than moving out. Once, President Kennedy said that happiness is, I quote, the full use of your powers along lines of excellence. Today, more and more young people have a chance to fully use their powers along lines of excellence here at home. Of course, there are still challenges, to spread opportunity to the most disadvantaged, to integrate into the mainstream those who have turned their backs on violence. But bitter, old divisions are falling away. A few months ago, students from St. Joseph's College and Knockbreda High School, who study a half-mile apart, met for the very first time and toured the sights of Belfast. One of them said, I always just saw their school badge but never talked to them. But when we met, we got on brilliant. Students from both schools are working with their counterparts from Mullingar Community College in the Republic to promote local recycling efforts. They're all taking part in Civic Link, an initiative supported by the Department of Education in the United States. Give them a hand there. This initiative we have supported through the Department of Education, and under your good friend Secretary Dick Riley, it has already brought together some 2,000 students and over 70 schools to break down barriers, build good will, and live lives based on tolerance and mutual respect. So I thank the ones, the students who are here, and I hope more will participate. Now, amidst all this momentum, why are we having this meeting, and why are all you showing up here? Because we've still got problems and headaches. And I just went through a whole lot of meetings about it. Two years ago George Mitchell said that implementing the Good Friday agreement would be harder than negotiating it. Why? Well, first, because the devil is always in the details, and second, because human nature being what it is, it's always easier to talk about high-minded change than it is to pull it off, or even to feel it inside. In spite of the overwhelming support for the Good Friday agreement and the evident progress already brought, opponents of peace still try to exploit the implementation controversies, to rub salt in old wounds, and serve their own ends. And others, for their own purposes, still stand on the sidelines watching and just waiting for something to go wrong. Well, I wanted you all to come together, first to show the world that the great majority of the people of Northern Ireland are still on the side of peace and want it to prevail; second, to say again to the proponents of violence that their way is finished; and third, to reaffirm, even in this great arena, that peace, unlike hockey, is not a spectator sport. No one can afford to sit on the sidelines. The progress that the leaders have made has only been possible because they knew when they took risks for peace they were acting on the yearning of the people for peace. For years you have made your view clear: Violence is not the answer; peace is the path to justice. The Good Friday accords define that path. Last week's tragic killings are a brutal reminder of a past we all wish to leave behind, that is not completely gone and a sober reminder that failing to move forward risks slipping backward. As the promises of the Good Friday accords are fulfilled or deferred, trust between the parties will rise or fall. We have seen that when trust rises and people work together, peace grows stronger, and when trust unravels, peace is made more vulnerable. The people of Northern Ireland must be clear and unequivocal about your support for peace. Remember, the enemies of peace don't really need your approval. All they need is your apathy. I do not believe you want Northern Ireland ever again to be a place where tomorrow's dreams are clouded by yesterday's nightmares. The genius of the Good Friday agreement still remains its core principles of consent, equality, justice, respect for each other and for law and order. These ideas are big enough to embody the aspirations, hopes, and needs of all the people of Northern Ireland. As I said before, your progress in putting these principles into practice has truly been remarkable. But again, we all know there is still much to do before the agreement's vision is fully and finally realized. We know, for example, there must be a full and irrevocable commitment to effecting change only through peaceful means, through ballots, not bullets. That means putting all arms fully, finally, and forever beyond use. Last week's IRA statement on this topic was a welcome development; the followthrough will be even more so. We welcome the contribution of those paramilitaries observing a cease-fire. Those who reject peace should know there is no place for them to hide. Based on my conversations with Prime Minister Ahern in Dublin yesterday and with Prime Minister Blair today, I want to say that the United States will intensify its cooperation with British and Irish authorities on counterterrorism, to combat groups seeking to undermine the Good Friday accords through violence. We are going to get experts from the three nations together in the near future, and the United States will continue to work in a systematic way to do whatever we can to help to root out terrorism and to make this peace agreement take hold. Now, we also know that real respect for human rights must be woven into the fabric of all your institutions. The light this will cast is the best guarantee that political violence will disappear. That's why it is so important to have a police force that inspires pride and confidence in all the people. Just before our gathering here, I met with victims of the violence, quite a large number of them who lost their children, their husbands, their wives, their limbs, their livelihood. Among them was the widow of an RUC officer and the sister of a slain defense attorney. Together, they offer the best testimony to the need to honor those who unjustifiably sacrificed their lives, their health, or their loved ones. We should honor those who have done their duty in the past while making a fresh start toward a police service that will protect, serve, and involve everyone equally in the years to come. Finally, and maybe most important of all, for the vision of the Good Friday agreement to be fully realized, all sides must be fully engaged with each other, understanding that they must move forward together or not at all, that for one community to succeed, the whole community must succeed. Over the last several hours today, I have talked to the parties. I'm convinced they do all genuinely want this peace process to work. They know how far it has come. They know how irresponsible it would be to permit it to fail. On the basis of our discussion, it is clear to me that's what must happen to move the process forward. First, the Patton Report must be implemented, and on that basis leaders from every part of the community must commit to make the new police service work. There must be security normalization, and arms must be put beyond use. This will lead to a reduction of fear and mistrust on all sides. And somehow these processes must take place together, giving practical effect on the ground to the rhetorical promise of peace. I think we can do this. Of course, it will be difficult. But I urge the parties, the political parties here, the British and Irish Governments, the communities themselves, to work out the way forward in the coming days and weeks. And we will do all we can to help. I have said before to all of you&mdash;I did 2 years ago when I was here&mdash;how profoundly important peace in Northern Ireland is to the rest of the world. This morning, when I got up, I saw the Prime Minister of Ethiopia on television, discussing the agreement the United States helped to broker there, between Ethiopia and Eritrea. I have been heavily involved in the Middle East for 8 years now and in many of the tribal conflicts in Africa, in a little-understood border conflict in the Andes, and many other places. And let me tell you, you cannot imagine the impact of the Good Friday agreement in Northern Ireland on troubled regions of the world&mdash;in Africa and the Middle East, in Latin America, and, of course, in the Balkans, where the United States has been heavily involved in my time. Peace continues to be challenged all around the world. It is more important than ever to say, but look what they did in Northern Ireland, and look what they are doing in Northern Ireland. In the end, there has to be a belief that you can only go forward together, that you cannot be lifted up by putting your neighbor down. You know, I think&mdash;and I talk in the United States about this a lot&mdash;our children will live in a completely different world than the one we have known. Just for example, because of the human genome project, which is going to give us cures for many kinds of cancers&mdash;Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and more important, will give mothers bringing little babies home from the hospital, roadmaps of their children's genetic makeup and future&mdash;very soon, life expectancy in places with decent health systems will be over 90 years. And the lives of the young people in this audience, I am convinced, average life expectancy will rise to 100 years. You will see new sources of energy tapped and new conservation technologies developed that will enable human beings for the first time both to increase wealth and to reduce energy use and global warming, ensuring a longer future on this planet for the great-grandchildren of the youngest people in this audience today. You will be able to, you young people, travel farther and faster through outer space and cyberspace even than people can today. The world will be so different for you. Now, I think the children of Northern Ireland deserve their fair chance to be a full part of that future. I believe the people of Northern Ireland want that for their children, and that means the leaders of Northern Ireland must find a way to do what is necessary to give that future to your children. You know, this is the last chance I will have as President to speak to the people of Northern Ireland. Let me say to all of you that I have tried to be pretty straightforward today in my remarks and not nearly as emotional as I feel. I think you know that I have loved this land and love the work I have tried to do for peace. But the issue is not how I feel; it's how your kids are going to live. I say to all of you, it has been a great honor for me; it has been an honor for the United States to be involved in the cause of peace in a land that produced the forbearers of so many of present-day America's citizens. I believe that the United States will be with you in the future. I know I will be with you in the future in whatever way I can. But in the end, I will say again, what really matters is not what America does, and what really matters is not even all the encouragement you give to people around the world. What really matters is what you do and whether you decide to give your children not your own yesterdays but their own tomorrows. Thank you, and God bless you.",clinton
"Thank you all for being here today, for your friendship and support, for giving me the opportunity to serve as your Governor for 11 years, for filling my life full of blessings beyond anything I ever deserved.<PI want to thank especially Hillary and Chelsea for taking this big step in our life's journey together. Hillary, for being my wife, my friend, and my partner in our efforts to build a better future for the children and families of Arkansas and America.

It is what we've devoted ourselves to here in Arkansas. I'm proud of what we've done here in Arkansas together. Proud of the work we've done to become a laboratory of democracy and innovation. And proud that we've done it without giving up the things we cherish and honor most about our way of life.

For the Soviet Empire never lost to us on the field of battle. Their system rotted from the inside out, from economic, political and spiritual failure.<PTo be sure, the collapse of communism requires a new national security policy. I applaud the President's recent initiative in reducing nuclear weapons. It is an important beginning. But make no mistake - the end of the Cold War is not the end of threats to America. The world is still a dangerous and uncertain place. The first and most solemn obligation of the president is to keep America strong and safe from foreign dangers, and promote democracy around the world.<PBut we cannot build a safe and secure world unless we can first make America strong at home. It is our ability to take care of our own at home that gives us the strength to stand up for what we believe around the world.<PAs governor for 11 years, working to preserve and create jobs in a global economy, I know our competition for the future is Germany and the rest of Europe, Japan and the rest of Asia. And I know that we are losing America's leadership in the world because we're losing the American dream right here at home.<PMiddle class people are spending more hours on the job, spending less time with their children, bringing home a smaller paycheck to pay more for health care and housing and education. Our streets are meaner, our families are broken, our health care is the costliest in the world and we get less for it.<PThe country is headed in the wrong direction fast, slipping behind, losing our way...and all we have out of Washington is status quo paralysis. No vision, no action. Just neglect, selfishness, and division.<PFor 12 years, Republicans have tried to divide us - race against race - so we get mad at each other and not at them. They want us to look at each other across a racial divide so we don't turn and look to the White House and ask, why are all of our incomes going down, why are all of us losing jobs? Why are we losing our future?<PWhere I come from we know about race-baiting. They've used it to divide us for years. I know this tactic well and I'm not going to let them get away with it.<PFor 12 years, the Republicans have talked about choice without really believing in it. George Bush says he wants school choice even if it bankrupts the public schools, and yet he's more than willing to make it a crime for the women of America to exercise their individual right to choose.<PFor 12 years, the Republicans have been telling us chat America's problems aren't their problem. They washed their hands of responsibility for the economy and education and health care and social policy and turned it over to fifty states and a thousand points of light. Well, here in Arkansas we've done our best to create jobs and educate our people. And each of us has tried to be one of those thousand points of light But I can tell you, where there is no national vision, no national partnership, no national leadership, a thousand points of light leaves a lot of darkness.<PWe must provide the answers...the solutions. And we will. We're going to turn this country around and get it moving again, and we're going to fight for the hard-working middle-class families of America for a change.<PMake no mistake - this election is about change: in our party, in our national leadership, and in our country.<PAnd we're not going to get positive change just by Bush-bashing. We have to do a better job of the old-fashioned work of confronting the real problems of real people and pointing the way to a better future. That is our challenge in 1992.<PToday, as we stand on the threshold of a new era, a new millennium, I believe we need a new kind of leadership, leadership committed to change. Leadership not mired in the politics of the past, not limited by old ideologies...Proven leadership that knows how to reinvent government to help solve the real problem of real people.<PThat is why today I am declaring my candidacy for President of the United States. Together I believe we can provide leadership that will restore the American dream - that will fight for the forgotten middle class - that will provide more opportunity, Insist on more responsibility and create a greater sense of community for this great country.<PThe change we must make isn't liberal or conservative. It's both, and it's different. The small towns and main streets of America aren't like the corridors and backrooms of Washington. People out here don't care about the idle rhetoric of left and right and liberal and conservative and all the other words that have made our politics a substitute for action. These families are crying out desperately for someone who believes the promise of America is to help them with their struggle to get ahead, to offer them a green light instead of a pink slip.<PThis must be a campaign of ideas, not slogans. We don't need another President who doesn't know what he wants to do for America. I'm going to tell you in plain language what I intend to do as President. How we can meet the challenges we face - that's the test for all the Democratic candidates in this campaign. Americans know what we're against Let's show them what we're for.<PWe need a new covenant to rebuild America. It's just common sense. Government's responsibility is to create more opportunity. The people's responsibility is to make the most of it.<PIn a Clinton Administration, we are going to create opportunity for all. We've got to grow this economy, not shrink it. We need to give people Incentives to make long-term investment in America and reward people who produce goods and services, not those who speculate with other people's money. We've got to invest more money in emerging technologies to help keep high-paying jobs here at home. We've got to convert from a defense to a domestic economy.<PWe've got to expand world trade, tear down barriers, but demand fair trade policies if we're going to provide good jobs for our people.

We need more than photo ops and empty rhetoric - we need standards and accountability and excellence in education. On this issue, I'm proud to say that Arkansas has led the way.<PIn a Clinton Administration, students and parents and teachers will get a real education President.<POpportunity for all means pre-school for every child who needs it, and an apprenticeship program for kids who don't want to go to college but do want good jobs. It means teaching everybody with a job to read, and passing a domestic GI Bill that would give every young American the chance to borrow the money necessary to go to college and ask them to pay it back either as a small percentage of their income over time, or through national service as teachers or policemen or nurses or child care workers.<PIn. a Clinton Administration, everyone will be able to get a college loan as long as they're willing to give something back to their country In return.<POpportunity for all means reforming the health care system to control costs, improve quality, expand preventive and long-term care, maintain consumer choice, and cover everybody. And we don't have to bankrupt the taxpayers to do it. We do have to take on the big insurance companies and health care bureaucracies and get some real cost control into the system. I pledge to the American people that in the first year of a Clinton Administration, we will present a plan to Congress and the American people to provide affordable, quality health care for all Americans.<POpportunity for all means making our cities and our streets safe from crime and drugs. Across America, citizens are banding together to take their streets and neighborhoods back. In a Clinton Administration, we'll be on their side with new initiatives like community policing, drug treatment for those who need it, and boot camps for first-time offenders.<POpportunity for all means making taxes fair. I'm not out to soak the rich. I wouldn't mind being rich. But I do believe the rich should pay their fair share. For 12 years, the Republicans have raised taxes on the middle class. It's time to give the middle class tax relief.<PFinally, opportunity for all means we must protect our environment and develop an energy policy that relies more on conservation and clean natural gas so all our children will inherit a world that is cleaner, safer, and more beautiful.<PBut hear me now. I honestly believe that if we try to do these things, we will still not solve the problems of today or move into the next century with confidence unless we do what President Kennedy did and ask every American citizen to assume personal responsibility for the future of our country.<PThe government owes our people more opportunity, but we all have to make the most of it through responsible citizenship.<PWe should insist that people move off welfare rolls and onto work rolls.

And when they don't, their children pay forever and so do we.<PAnd we have got to say, as we've tried to do in Arkansas, that students have a responsibility to stay in school. If you drop out for no good reason, you should lose your driver's license. But its important to remember that the most irresponsible people of all in the 1980s were those at the top...not those who were doing worse, not the hard-working middle class, but those who sold out our savings and loans with bad deals and spent billions on wasteful takeovers and mergers - money that could have been spent to create better products and new jobs.<PDo you know that in the 1980s, while middle-class income went down, charitable giving by working people went up? And while rich peoples incomes went up, charitable giving by the wealthy went down. Why? Because our leaders had an ethic of get it while you can and to heck with everybody else.<PHow can you ask people who work or who are poor to behave responsibly, when they know that the heads of our biggest companies raised their own pay in the last decade by four times the percentage their workers' pay went up? Three times as much as their profits went up. When they ran their companies into the ground and their employees were on the street, what did they do? They bailed out with golden parachutes to a cushy life. That's just wrong.<PTeddy Roosevelt and Harry Truman and John Kennedy didn't hesitate to use the bully pulpit of the Presidency. They changed America by standing up for what's right. When Salomon Brothers abused the Treasury markets, the President was silent. When the<Prip-off artists looted our S&L's the President Was Silent. In a Clinton Administration, when people sell their companies and their workers and their country down the river, they'll get called on the carpet. We're going to insist that they invest In this country and create jobs for our people.<PIn the 1980s, Washington failed us too. We spent more money on the present and the past and less on the future. We spent $500 billion to recycle assets in the S&L mess, but we couldn't afford $5 billion for unemployed workers or to give every kid in this country the chance to be in Head Start. We can do better than that, and we will.<PA Clinton Administration won't spend our money on programs that don't solve problems and a government that doesn't work. I want to reinvent government to make it more efficient and more effective. I want to give citizens more choices in the services they get, and empower them to make those choices. That's what we've tried to do in Arkansas. We've balanced the budget every year and improved services. We've treated taxpayers like our customers and our bosses, because they are.<PI want the American people to know that a Clinton Administration will defend our national interests abroad, put their values into our social policy at home, and spend their tax money with discipline. Well put government back on the side of the hard-working middle-class families of America who think most of the help goes to those at the top of the ladder, some goes to the bottom, and no one speaks for them.<PBut we need more than new laws, new promises, or new program. We need a new spirit of community, a sense that we are all in this together. If we have no sense of community the American dream will continue to wither. Our destiny is bound up with the destiny of every other American. Were all in this together, and we will rise or fail together.<PA few years ago, Hillary and I visited a classroom in Los Angeles, in an area plagued by drugs and gangs. We talked to a dozen sixth graders, whose number one concern was being shot going to and from school. Their second worry was turning 12 or 13 and being forced to join a gang or be beaten. And finally, they were worried about their own parents' drug abuse.<PNewly half a century ago, I was born not far from here in Hope, Arkansas. My mother had been widowed three months before I was born. I was raised for four years by my grandparents, while she went back to nursing school. They didn't have much money. I spent a lot of time with my great-grandparents. By any standard, they were poor. But we didn't blame other people. We took responsibility for ourselves and for each other because we knew we could do better. I was raised to believe In the American dream, in family values, in individual responsibility, and in the obligation of government to help people who were doing the best they could.<PIts a long way in America from that loving family which is embodied today in a picture on my wall in the Governor's office of me at the age of six holding my great-grandfather's hand to an America where children on the streets of our cities don't know who their grandparents are and have to worry about their own parents' drug abuse.<PI tell you, by making common cause with those children, we give new life to the American dream. And that is our generation's responsibility - to form a new covenant... more opportunity for all, more responsibility from everyone, and a greater sense of common purpose.<PI believe with all my heart that together, we can make this happen. We can usher in a new era of progress, prosperity and renewal. We can &mdash; we must. This is not just a campaign for the Presidency &mdash; it is a campaign for the future, for the forgotten hard-working middle class families of America who deserve a government that fights for them. A campaign to keep America strong at home and around the world. Join with us. I ask for your prayers, your help, your hands, and your hearts. Together we can make America great again, and build a community of hope that will inspire the world.",clinton
"No American foreign policy can succeed if it neglects our domestic needs. And no American foreign policy can succeed if it slights our commitment to democracy. The President often takes a lot of credit for Communism's downfall, but fails to recognize that the global democratic revolution actually gave freedom its birth. He simply does not seem at home in the mainstream pro-democracy tradition of American foreign policy. He shows little regard for the idea that we must have a principled and coherent American purpose in international affairs, something he calls the vision thing. Instead, President Bush seems too often to prefer a foreign policy that embraces stability at the expense of freedom, a foreign policy built more on personal relationships with foreign leaders than on consideration of how those leaders acquired and maintained their power. It is almost as if this Administration were nostalgic for a world of times past, when foreign policy was the exclusive preserve of a few aristocrats. This approach to foreign policy is sometimes described as power politics, to distinguish it from what some contend is sentimentalism and idealism of a pro-democracy foreign policy. But in a world where freedom, not tyranny, is on the march, the cynical calculus of pure power politics simply does not compute. It is ill-suited to a new era in which ideas and information are broadcast around the globe before ambassadors can read their cable. Simple reliance on old balance-of-power strategies cannot bring the same practical success as a foreign policy that draws more generously from American democratic experience and ideals and lights fires in the hearts of millions of freedom-loving people around the world. STATEMENT OF PURPOSELet there be no mistake, this world is still a dangerous place. Military power still matters. And I am committed to maintaining a strong and ready defense. I will use that strength where necessary to defend our vital interests. But power must be accompanied by clear purpose. Mr. Bush's ambivalence about supporting democracy, his eagerness to defend potentates and dictators, has shown itself time and again. It has been a disservice not only to our democratic values, but also to our national interest. For in the long run I believe that Mr. Bush's neglect of our democratic ideals abroad could do as much harm as our neglect of our economic needs at home. Let us look at the record. It reflects an unmistakable pattern in the Bush Administration's foreign policy. Fearing attacks by isolationists in his own party, President Bush was reluctant to offer Boris Yeltsin, Russia's freely elected president, a helping hand. It took a chorus of complaints, culminating with the prodding of another Republican, Richard Nixon, to move him into action on the Russian aid package. Just weeks before the attempted coup in Moscow, President Bush traveled to Ukraine. There he lectured a people subjected to genocidal starvation in the Stalin era, warning that their aspirations for independence constituted, and I quote, a suicidal nationalism. A few months later, the people of Ukraine voted by a huge margin for the immediate and total dissolution of the Soviet Union. ACTION ON THE BALTICSFor over 40 years, the United States refused to recognize Soviet claims to the Baltic nations: Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. But when at long last, the moment of Baltic independence came, President Bush suddenly became a reluctant bridegroom. The United States was 37th among the world's nations to extend diplomatic recognition to these countries. We should have been first.. . . In the Middle East, I supported the President when it became necessary to evict Saddam Hussein from Kuwait, and I support his decision now to provide air cover to Saddam's Kurdish and Shiite opponents in the north and the south of Iraq. But I am angered by the Administration's appeasement of Saddam Hussein before the war and disappointed by its callous disregard for democratic principles after the war. Just this week another friend of freedom, my running mate, Senator Gore, laid out in precise and devastating detail the errors of this Administration in dealing with Saddam Hussein. President Bush showered Government-backed grain credits and high technology on a regime that had used poison gas on its own people. After the war, Mr. Bush encouraged the Iraqi people to revolt against Saddam Hussein but then abandoned them. MIDDLE EAST POLICIESThe Administration has sometimes treated the conflict between Israel and the Arab states as just another quarrel between religions and nations, rather than one in which the survival of a democratic ally, Israel, has been at stake. I support strongly the peace talks that are under way, and if elected, I will continue without interruption America's role in them. I also believe that America's policy in the Middle East should be guided by a vision of the region in which Israel and Arab partners are secure in their peace, and where the practices and principles of the personal liberty and governmental accountability are spreading.",clinton
"Good afternoon. Ladies and gentlemen, I have just heard a summary of President Bush's recently concluded remarks. I'd like to begin by expressing my appreciation for them. I'd like to read this statement. Today I want to reaffirm the essential continuity of American foreign policy and my desire to seek bipartisan support for our role in the world. During the transition that is now beginning, I urge America's friends and foes alike to recognize, as I do, that America has only one President at a time, that America's foreign policy remains solely in his hands, that even as America's Administrations change, America's fundamental interests do not, that the greatest gesture of good will any nation can make toward me is to continue their full cooperation during this period with our one President, George Bush, and that the greatest mistake any adversary could make would be to doubt America's resolve during this period of transition. I look forward to working closely with President Bush to insure continuity in global affairs of interest to all Americans, from continued progress in the Mideast peace talks to completing negotiations on the details of the START II arms control agreement, to making progress toward a good agreement on our world trade talks, to bolstering Russia's fledgling democracy, to working toward peaceful resolution of the conflict in the republics of the former Yugoslavia, to assisting the victims of famine in Somalia. I also look forward to getting to work on the hard and vital task of restoring our nation's economic strength. Today I say to our financial and business leaders that although change is on the horizon, we understand the need to pursue stability even as we pursue new growth. The changes I seek will strengthen America's market systems not weaken them. And to the people of our great nation, for whom we pledge to get up every morning and work hard to bring the economic opportunity that was at the core of the Clinton-Gore campaign, I say that the task has already begun. It will not be easy, but we will spare no effort to restore growth, jobs and incomes to the American people. Let me also stress the stakes and the opportunities in the months and years that lie ahead. The cold war is won. Now we have a chance to build a new peace. We have entered a global economy. Now we have the opportunity to master its competitive challenges rather than let these changes undermine our strength. We have become a diverse people of many colors and languages and beliefs. Now we have the obligation to insure that our diversity is a source of strength and pride to all of us here at home and around the world. We've become a nation of 250 million Americans. Now we have the opportunity, the duty and the imperative to see that we do not leave even one of those 250 million behind as we move toward the next century. We have entered a period of great challenge and extraordinary opportunity for our nation. I am confident we can make it a proud time in our history, proud for the families who are raising this nation's next generation, proud for the workers and businesses who are America's lifeblood, proud for the men and women who wear America's uniforms and proud for the peoples of other nations living today in freedom, or in fear, who draw strength from American ideals, and share our vision of a peaceful and more prosperous world. America has called upon me to be our next President. But our forebears call on all of us at this moment to honor their efforts, their sacrifices, their ideals and their lives by working hard and working together to improve this good and great nation as much for our children and our children's children as those who preceded us did for us. They call on us to take our dreams and our hopes and make them real. Thank you, and God bless America.",clinton
"PRESIDENT-ELECT BILL CLINTON Today, I have asked you here to announce the first members of our economic team. These people are seasoned, skilled, incredibly able and ready to work for the American people. I stress the word team because the success of our economic action agenda will depend not only on the talents of these people as individuals and those whom I will announce in the next few days, but also in their capacity to work together for the common good of all Americans. They are deeply aware that we must not be the first generation of Americans to leave a worse economy to our children. And as I have said repeatedly, our nation faces two deficits, a budget deficit and an investment deficit. I'm going to work my heart out with these people to construct a strong, long-term plan for economic growth, for jobs, for incomes, and to reduce our national debt. My first appointment, intentionally, is the Secretary of the Treasury. In filling this post, I wanted someone who had the unique capacity to command the respect of Wall Street, which showing an unrelenting concern for the Americans who make their living on Main Street. When Lloyd Bentsen agreed to serve as Secretary of the Treasury, it is safe to say I succeeded. In American politics when you say the words stature, dignity, and respects, Lloyd Bentsen's name comes right to mind. I've known Senator Bentsen for many years, and, as a few of my folks know, I've had him in mind for this position for a long time, long before I was actually elected President. I followed his work for years as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee; I know about the tax bills he tried to have written into law, which would have promoted more investment and less consumption; I know about the trade positions he's tried to convince our country to take which would have promoted more free trade but a tougher set of demand to open markets to American products. But he, too, needs a team, and the team that will take the helm at the Treasury Department is truly exceptional, in part because of the creativity and quality of the person who will be appointed as deputy secretary of the Treasury, Roger Altman. Roger is a longtime friend of mine, a former assistant secretary of the Treasury, a preeminent investment banker. And he's been one of my closest economic advisers throughout this entire campaign. As director of the Office of Management and Budget, Congressman Leon Panetta will bring integrity to this critical office and restore the confidence of the American people and their elected representatives that O.M.B. is shooting straight with the Congress and shooting straight with the American people, and doing its best to help us not only to have a responsible budget but to manage the massive American Government in a different and better way than ever before. As chairman of the House Budget Committee, Leon Panetta brought a unique combination of strong leadership and superb technical skills. With Leon Panetta as O.M.B. director, I believe that agency can play the pivotal role we have to have it play in the swift and effective implementation of our economic plan. I'm also delighted to announce that Alice Rivlin, the former director of the Congressional Budget Office and one of our nation's most respected budget experts, has agreed to serve as deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget. Together, Alice and Leon promise to be the most dynamic team in the history of O.M.B. and to restore the confidence of the Congress that the executive branch is going to be a responsible partner in making the budgets of this country. Finally, I have asked Robert Rubin to serve as assistant to the President for economic policy and to help to coordinate and to direct our new Economic Council. I've created this new role, similar to that of the national security adviser in the present White House, because the coordination of our nation's economic policy is every bit as essential as the coordination of foreign policy to our long-term national security. Bob Rubin has enjoyed a brilliant career at his firm, and has throughout manifested concern for the welfare of all Americans, and a special concern for the welfare of the inner city poor for whom he has worked as a member of the Cuomo Commission and in other contexts. This new Economic Council which I will chair embodies our commitment to make economic prosperity the top priority of this administration and to sharply focus on economic policy in the White House. Today's appointments are just the first of many. In the coming days and before too long, we will have appointed the entire economic team and the remainder of the Cabinet. When we are done, the American people know that I mean business when it comes to our campaign commitment to promote a high way, high growth, strong and vital economy, not only for today's Americans, but for the future generations as well.QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS # Can you tell us, who will be taking orders from whom -- Mr. Rubin from Mr. Bentsen, or Mr. Bentsen from Mr. Rubin? It's not quite clear what each one will be doing here. PRESIDENT-ELECT CLINTON Well, I think it is quite clear. First of all, the Secretary of the Treasury will continue to be the principal economic spokesperson after the President for this Administration, just as it has traditionally occurred. Mr. Rubin's job will be very much like General Scowcroft's job on the national security side in this Administration. His job will be to coordinate, to facilitate and to provide some direction to the deliberations of our economic council. It will be a larger group than the National Security Council because it will include not only these departments, but also some others which I have discussed with you before, like Commerce, Labor, Energy. And it is a very important job. But in the end, I will make the ultimate decisions and be the ultimate arbiter when there has to be an arbiter. I think that if you go back to the campaign structure that we tried to provide, which really did defy past organizations because it was less hierarchical and more team work oriented, that's what I expect to provide here. And I think that because we want to bring in more people in a more systematic way and reconcile what these departments are doing so they can reinforce and energy one another, I decided that I needed someone on the domestic side to be that sort of coordinator and facilitator but these departments, each will stand on their own. . . . The Treasury will still be the place where the President's economic views are spoken for after the President does it. SENATOR LLOYD BENTSEN I've heard all these stories about my being an insider. Let me tell you, I felt like an outsider for 12 years. And I'm tired of the gridlock. To do the things we've tried to do on campaign reform, do the things we tried to do on a tough crime bill, to do the things that we did in the last tax bill, to put economic incentives in there to create jobs, and to get this country moving again, and to see those kinds of things vetoed, I'm just delighted to see us be able to bring about the kind of change, to create those jobs now, with a Democratic President, a Democratic President like Bill Clinton. I think you're going to see those hopes turn into reality. And to be able to pass those and put them into law is what I'm so pleased about. And as far as the Secretary of the Treasury's job, I know you're probably looking for more maturity in that job. But I'll do what I can. REPRESENTATIVE LEON E. PANETTA I think everyone that knows me as chairman of the Budget Committee and my work on the budget, we've been basically fighting the budgets that have been presented over the last 12 years concerned about the priorities that we part of those budgets, the failure to invest in our society, and the fact that they would ultimately produce the record deficits that they have produced. So I've been fighting against those kinds of budgets in the time I've been in Congress, and I think the President-elect and I share a common commitment, not only to long-term deficit reduction, but to making the investments in education and health care and infrastructure and growth that this Administration has failed to make over the last few years. # Governor Clinton, and also Senator Bentsen, for both of you, were you at all concerned in picking Senator Bentsen that his choice might lead to the loss of yet another Democratic Senate seat in Texas that might make your job of getting your program passed harder? And Senator Bentsen, did that play any part in your decision whether to take this position? SENATOR BENTSEN Obviously that's something that would be of some concern to me. But the Democratic Party in Texas is in great shape and we have a very effective and attractive Governor who will be making that decision and that choice and who will play a major role in that campaign and I think the odds are just excellent that a Democrat will succeed me in that spot. PRESIDENT-ELECT CLINTON I did give it some thought. It crossed my mind. I think that frankly the kind of leadership that has been provided in Texas by people like Ann Richards, Henry Cisneros, John Sharp, that they and many others have embodied the kind of new Democratic Party that we're trying to bring to the United States. And I think there's a good chance that Governor Richards will name someone senator who will have the confidence of the people of Texas. I thought about it. But I also thought that Senator Bentsen was the best choice for America for Treasury Secretary and I think the people of Texas will respond to that. But I don't think there's any reason to believe that the Democrats can't be highly competitive in that job. # The Justice Department has decided not to appoint a special prosecutor in the Iraqgate case. Do you believe that there is a need for additional inquiries in that? And will you appoint, have your Justice Department appoint, a special prosecutor after you take office? PRESIDENT-ELECT CLINTON I certainly think we need to know more about it than we now know. And what I intend to do is to appoint an Attorney General and then get a recommendation on it. And generically, let me make a statement, the special prosecutor law, as you know, either just did or is about to expire and I had to tell you, I think it should be reenacted. And I will support that.",clinton
"Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!In the spring of 1971 I met a girl. [laughter and applause]The first time I saw her we were, appropriately enough, in a class on political and civil rights. She had thick blond hair, big glasses, wore no makeup, and she had a sense of strength and self-possession that I found magnetic. After the class I followed her out, intending to introduce myself. I got close enough to touch her back, but I couldn't do it. Somehow I knew this would not be just another tap on the shoulder, that I might be starting something I couldn't stop.And I saw her several more times in the next few days, but I still didn't speak to her. Then one night I was in the law library talking to a classmate who wanted me to join the Yale Law Journal. He said it would guarantee me a job in a big firm or a clerkship with a federal judge. I really wasn't interested, I just wanted to go home to Arkansas. Then I saw the girl again, standing at the opposite end of that long room. Finally she was staring back at me, so I watched her. She closed her book, put it down and started walking toward me. She walked the whole length of the library, came up to me and said, look, if you're going to keep staring at me......and now I'm staring back, we at least ought to know each other's name. I'm Hillary Rodham, who are you? I was so impressed and surprised that, whether you believe it or not, momentarily I was speechless. [laughter and applause]Finally, I sort of blurted out my name and we exchanged a few words and then she went away.Well, I didn't join the Law Review, but I did leave that library with a whole new goal in mind. A couple of days later, I saw her again. I remember, she was wearing a long, white, flowery skirt. And I went up to her and she said she was going to register for classes for the next term. And I said I'd go, too. And we stood in line and talked &mdash; you had to do that to register back then &mdash; and I thought I was doing pretty well until we got to the front of the line and the registrar looked up and said, Bill, what are you doing here, you registered morning? I turned red and she laughed that big laugh of hers. And I thought, well, heck, since my cover's been blown I just went ahead and asked her to take a walk down to the art museum.We've been walking and talking and laughing together ever since. And we've done it in good times and bad, through joy and heartbreak. We cried together this morning on the news that our good friend and a lot of your good friend, Mark Weiner, passed away early this morning.We've built up a lifetime of memories. After the first month and that first walk, I actually drove her home to Park Ridge, Illinois......to meet her family and see the town where she grew up, a perfect example of post World War II middle-class America, street after street of nice houses, great schools, good parks, a big public swimming pool, and almost all white.I really liked her family. Her crusty, conservative father, her rambunctious brothers, all extolling the virtues of rooting for the Bears and the Cuba. And for the people from Illinois here, they even told me what waiting for next year meant. It could be next year, guys.Now, her mother was different. She was more liberal than the boys. And she had a childhood that made mine look like a piece of cake. She was easy to underestimate with her soft manner and she reminded me all over again of the truth of that old saying you should never judge a book by its covers. Knowing her was one of the greatest gifts Hillary ever gave me. I learned that Hillary got her introduction to social justice through her Methodist youth minister, Don Jones. He took her downtown to Chicago to hear Dr. Martin Luther King speak and he remained her friend for the rest of his life. This will be the only campaign of hers he ever missed.When she got to college, her support for civil rights, her opposition to the Vietnam War compelled her to change party, to become a Democrat. And then between college and law school on a total lark she went alone to Alaska and spent some time sliming fish. More to the point, by the time I met her she had already been involved in the law school's legal services project and she had been influenced by Marian Wright Edelman. She took a summer internship interviewing workers in migrant camps for Senator Walter Mondale's subcommittee. She had also begun working in the Yale New Haven Hospital to develop procedures to handle suspected child abuse cases. She got so involved in children's issues that she actually took an extra year in law school working at the child studies center to learn what more could be done to improve the lives and the futures of poor children. So she was already determined to figure out how to make things better.Hillary opened my eyes to a whole new world of public service by private citizens. In the summer of 1972, she went to Dothan, Alabama to visit one of those segregated academies that then enrolled over half-a-million white kids in the South. The only way the economics worked is if they claimed federal tax exemptions to which they were not legally entitled. She got sent to prove they weren't.So she sauntered into one of these academies all by herself, pretending to be a housewife that had just moved to town and needed to find a school for her son. And they exchanged pleasantries and finally she said, look, let's just get to the bottom line here, if I enroll my son in this school will he be in a segregated school, yes or know? And the guy said absolutely. She had him! I've seen it a thousand times since. And she went back and her encounter was part of a report that gave Marian Marian Wright Edelman the ammunition she needed to keep working to force the Nixon administration to take those tax exemptions away and give our kids access to an equal education. Then she went down to south Texas where she met......she met one of the nicest fellows I ever met, the wonderful union leader Franklin Garcia, and he helped her register Mexican-American voters. I think some of them are still around to vote for her in 2016. Then in our last year in law school, Hillary kept up this work. She went to South Carolina to see why so many young......she went to South Carolina to see why so many young African-American boys, I mean, young teenagers, were being jailed for years with adults in men's prisons. And she filed a report on that, which led to some changes, too. Always making things better. Now, meanwhile, let's get back to business. I was trying to convince her to marry me. I first proposed to her on a trip to Great Britain, the first time she had been overseas. And we were on the shoreline of this wonderful little lake, Lake Ennerdale. I asked her to marry me and she said I can't do it. So in 1974 I went home to teach in the law school and Hillary moved to Massachusetts......to keep working on children's issues. This time trying to figure out why so many kids counted in the Census weren't enrolled in school. She found one of them sitting alone on her porch in a wheelchair. Once more, she filed a report about these kids, and that helped influence ultimately the Congress to adopt the proposition that children with disabilities, physical or otherwise, should have equal access to public education. You saw the results of that last night when Anastasia Somoza talked. She never made fun of people with disabilities; she tried to empower them based on their abilities. Meanwhile, I was still trying to get her to marry me. So the second time I tried a different tack. I said I really want you to marry me, but you shouldn't do it. And she smiled and looked at me, like, what is this boy up to? She said that is not a very good sales pitch. I said I know, but it's true. And I meant it, it was true.I said I know most of the young Democrats our age who want to go into politics, they mean well and they speak well, but none of them is as good as you are at actually doing things to make positive changes in people's lives. So I suggested she go home to Illinois or move to New York and look for a chance to run for office. She just laughed and said, are you out of you mind, nobody would ever vote for me. So I finally got her to visit me in Arkansas. And when she did, the people at the law school were so impressed they offered a teaching position. And she decided to take a huge chance. She moved to a strange place, more rural, more culturally conservative than anyplace she had ever been, where she knew good and well people would wonder what in the world she was like and whether they could or should accept her.Didn't take them long to find out what she was like. She loved her teaching and she got frustrated when one of her students said, well, what do you expect, I'm just from Arkansas. She said, don't tell me that, you're as smart as anybody, you've just got to believe in yourself and work hard and set high goals. She believed that anybody could make it. She also started the first legal aid clinic in northwest Arkansas, providing legal aid services to poor people who couldn't pay for them. And one day I was driving her to the airport to fly back to Chicago when we passed this little brick house that had a for sale sign on it. And she said, boy, that's a pretty house. It had 1,100 square feet, an attic, fan and no air conditioner in hot Arkansas, and a screened-in porch.Hillary commented on what a uniquely designed and beautiful house it was. So I took a big chance. I bought the house. My mortgage was $175 a month. When she came back, I picked up her up and I said, you remember that house you liked? She said yeah. I said, while you were gone I bought it, you have to marry me now. The third time was the charm. We were married in that little house on October the 11th, 1975. I married my best friend. I was still in awe after more than four years of being around her at how smart and strong and loving and caring she was. And I really hoped that her choosing me and rejecting my advice to pursue her own career was a decision she would never regret.A little over a year later we moved to Little Rock when I became attorney general and she joined the oldest law firm west of the Mississippi. Soon after, she started a group called the Arkansas Advocates for Families and Children. [cheering]It's a group, as you can hear, is still active today. In 1979, just after I became governor, I asked Hillary to chair a rural health committee to help expand health care to isolated farm and mountain areas. They recommended to do that partly by deploying trained nurse practitioners in places with no doctors to provide primary care they were trained to provide. It was a big deal then, highly controversial and very important.And I got the feeling that what she did for the rest of her life she was doing there. She just went out and figured out what needed to be done and what made the most sense and what would help the most people. And then if it was controversial she'd just try to persuade people it was the right thing to do. It wasn't the only big thing that happened that spring my first year as governor. We found out we were going to be parents. And time passed. On February 27th, 1980, 15 minutes after I got home from the National Governors Conference in Washington, Hillary's water broke and off we went to the hospital. Chelsea was born just before midnight. And it was the greatest moment of my life. The miracle of a new beginning. The hole it filled for me because my own father died before I was born, and the absolute conviction that my daughter had the best mother in the whole world. For the next 17 years, through nursing school, Montessori, kindergarten, through T-ball, softball, soccer, volleyball and her passion for ballet, through sleepovers, summer camps, family vacations and Chelsea's own very ambitious excursions, from Halloween parties in the neighborhood, to a Viennese waltz gala in the White House, Hillary first and foremost was a mother.She became, as she often said, our family's designated worrier, born with an extra responsibility gene. The truth is we rarely disagreed on parenting, although she did believe that I had gone a little over the top when I took a couple of days off with Chelsea to watch all six Police Academy movies back-to-back. When Chelsea was 9 months old, I was defeated for reelection in the Reagan landslide. And I became overnight, I think, the youngest former governor in the history of the country. We only had two-year terms back then.Hillary was great. Immediately she said, OK, what are we going to do? Here's what we're going to do, we're going to get a house, you're going to get a job, we're going to enjoy being Chelsea's parents. And if you really want to run again, you've got to go out and talk to people and figure out why you lost, tell people you got the message and show them you've still got good ideas.I followed her advice. Within two days we had a house, I soon had a job. We had two fabulous years with Chelsea. And in 1982, I became the first governor in the history of our state to be elected, defeated and elected again. I think my experience is it's a pretty good thing to follow her advice. The rest of the decade sort of flew by as our lives settled into a rhythm of family and work and friends.In 1983, Hillary chaired a committee to recommend new education standards for us as a part of and in response to a court order to equalize school funding and a report by a national expert that said our woefully underfunded schools were the worst in America.Typical Hillary, she held listening tours in all 75 counties with our committee. She came up with really ambitious recommendations. For example, that we be the first state in America to require elementary counselors in every school because so many kids were having trouble at home and they needed it. So I called the legislature into session hoping to pass the standards, pass a pay raise for teachers and raise the sales tax to pay for it all. I knew it would be hard to pass, but it got easier after Hillary testified before the education committee and the chairman, a plainspoken farmer, said looks to me like we elected the wrong Clinton.[laughter and applause]Well, by the time I ran for president nine years later, the same expert who said that we had the worst schools in America said that our state was one of the two most improved states in America. And that's because of those standards that Hillary developed. Now, two years later, Hillary told me about a preschool program developed in Israel called HIPPY, Home Instruction Program for Preschool Youngsters. The idea was to teach low-income parents, even those that couldn't read, to be their children's first teachers.She said she thought it would work in Arkansas. I said that's great, what are we going to do about it? She said, oh, I already did it. I called the woman who started the program in Israel, she'll be here in about 10 days and help us get started.Next thing you know I'm being dragged around to all these little preschool graduations. Now, keep in mind, this was before any state even had universal kindergarten and I'm being dragged to preschool graduations watching these poor parents with tears in their eyes because they never thought they'd be able to help their kids learn. Now, 20 years of research has shown how well this program works to improve readiness for school and academic achievement. There are a lot of young adults in America who have no idea Hillary had anything to do with it who are enjoying better lives because they were in that program.She did all this while being a full-time worker, a mother and enjoying our life. Why? Well, she's insatiably curious, she's a natural leader, she's a good organizer, and she's the best darn change-maker I ever met in my entire life. Look, this is a really important point. This is a really important point for you to take out of this convention. If you believe in making change from the bottom up, if you believe the measure of change is how many people's lives are better, you know it's hard and some people think it's boring. Speeches like this are fun.Actually doing the work is hard. So people say, well, we need to change. She's been around a long time, she sure has, and she's sure been worth every single year she's put into making people's lives better. I can tell you this. If you were sitting where I'm sitting and you heard what I have heard at every dinner conversation, every lunch conversation, on every lone walk, you would say this woman has never been satisfied with the status quo in anything. She always wants to move the ball forward. That is just who she is. When I became president with a commitment to reform health care, Hillary was a natural to head the health care task force. You all know we failed because we couldn't break a Senate filibuster. Hillary immediately went to work on solving the problems the bill sought to address one by one. The most important goal was to get more children with health insurance. In 1997, Congress passed the Children's Health Insurance Program, still an important part of President Obama's Affordable Care Act. It insures more than 8 million kids. There are a lot of other things in that bill that she got done piece by piece, pushing that rock up the hill.In 1997, she also teamed with the House Minority Leader Tom DeLay, who maybe disliked me more than any of Newt Gingrich's crowd. They worked on a bill together to increase adoptions of children under foster care. She wanted to do it because she knew that Tom DeLay, for all of our differences, was an adoptive parent and she honored him for doing that. Now, the bill they worked on, which passed with an overwhelming bipartisan majority, led to a big increase in the adoption of children out of foster care, including non-infant kids and special-needs kids. It made life better because she's a change-maker, that's what she does. Now, when you're doing all this, real life doesn't stop. 1997 was the year Chelsea finished high school and went to college. We were happy for her, but sad for us to see her go. I'll never forget moving her into her dorm room at Stanford. It would have been a great little reality flick. There I was in a trance just staring out the window trying not to cry, and there was Hillary on her hands and knees desperately looking for one more drawer to put that liner paper in.Finally, Chelsea took charge and told us ever so gently that it was time for us to go. So we closed a big chapter in the most important work of our lives. As you'll see Thursday night when Chelsea speaks, Hillary's done a pretty fine job of being a mother. And as you saw last night, beyond a shadow of a doubt so has Michelle Obama. Now, fast forward. In 1999, Congressman Charlie Rangel and other New York Democrats urged Hillary......urged Hillary to run for the seat of retiring Senator Pat Moynihan. We had always intended to go to New York after I left office and commute to Arkansas, but this had never occurred to either one of us. Hillary had never run for office before, but she decided to give it a try.She began her campaign the way she always does new things, by listening and and learning. And after a tough battle, New York elected her to the seat once held by another outsider, Robert Kennedy. And she didn't let him down. Her early years were dominated by 9/11, by working to fund the recovery, then monitoring the health and providing compensation to victims and first and second responders. She and Senator Schumer were tireless and so were our House members.In 2003, partly spurred on by what we were going through, she became the first senator in the history of New York ever to serve on the Armed Services Committee. So she tried to make sure people on the battlefield had proper equipment. She tried to expand and did expand health care coverage to Reservists and members of the National Guard. She got longer family leave, working with Senator Dodd, for people caring for wounded service members.And she worked for more extensive care for people with traumatic brain injury. She also served on a special Pentagon commission to propose changes necessary to meet our new security challenges. Newt Gingrich was on that commission, he told me what a good job she had done. I say that because nobody who has seriously dealt with the men and women in today's military believes they are a disaster. They are a national treasure of all races, all religions, all walks of life. Now, meanwhile, she compiled a really solid record, totally progressive on economic and social issues. She voted for and against some proposed trade deals. She became the de facto economic development officer for the area of New York outside the ambit of New York City.She worked for farmers, for winemakers, for small businesses and manufacturers, for upstate cities in rural areas who needed more ideas and more new investment to create good jobs, something we have to do again in small-town and rural America, in neighborhoods that have been left behind in our cities and Indian country and, yes, in coal country. When she lost a hard-fought contest to President Obama in 2008, she worked for his election hard. But she hesitated to say yes when he asked her to join his Cabinet because she so loved being a senator from New York.So like me, in a different context, he had to keep asking. But as we all saw and heard from Madeleine Albright, it was worth the effort and worth the wait. As secretary of state, she worked hard to get strong sanctions against Iran's nuclear program. And in what The Wall Street Journal no less called a half-court shot at the buzzer, she got Russia and China to support them. Her team negotiated the New START Treaty with Russia to reduce nuclear weapons and reestablish inspections. And she got enough Republican support to get two-thirds of the Senate, the vote necessary to ratify the treaty. She flew all night long from Cambodia to the Middle East to get a cease-fire that would avoid a full-out shooting war between Hamas and Israel in Gaza to protect the peace of the region.She backed President Obama's decision to go after Osama bin Laden. She launched a team, this is really important today, she launched a team to fight back against terrorists online and built a new global counterterrorism effort.We've got to win this battle in the mind field.She put climate change at the center of our foreign policy. She negotiated the first agreement ever &mdash; ever &mdash; where China and India officially committed to reduce their emissions. And as she had been doing since she went to Beijing in 1995 and said women's rights are human rights and human rights are women's rights......she worked to empower women and girls around the world and to make the same exact declaration on behalf of the LGBT community in America and around the world. And nobody ever talks about this much, nobody ever talks about this much, but it's important to me. She tripled the number of people with AIDS in poor countries whose lives are being saved with your tax dollars, most of them in Africa, going from 1.7 million lives to 5.1 million lives and it didn't cost you any more money. She just bought available FDA-approved generic drugs, something we need to do for the American people more. Now, you don't know any of these people. You don't know any of those 3.4 million people, but I'll guarantee you they know you. They know you because they see you as thinking their lives matter. They know you and that's one reason the approval of the United States was 20 points higher when she left the secretary of state's office than when she took it. Now, how does this square? How did this square with the things that you heard at the Republican convention? What's the difference in what I told you and what they said? How do you square it? You can't. One is real, the other is made up.You just have to decide. You just have to decide which is which, my fellow Americans.The real one had done more positive change-making before she was 30 than many public officials do in a lifetime in office. The real one, if you saw her friend Betsy Ebeling vote for Illinois today......has friends from childhood through Arkansas, where she has not lived in more than 20 years, who have gone all across America at their own expense to fight for the person they know. The real one has earned the loyalty, the respect and the fervent support of people who have worked with her in every stage of her life, including leaders around the world who know her to be able, straightforward and completely trustworthy.The real one calls you when you're sick, when your kid's in trouble or when there's a death in the family.The real one repeatedly drew praise from prominent Republicans when she was a senator and secretary of state. So what's up with it? Well, if you win elections on the theory that government is always bad and will mess up a two-car parade......a real change-maker represents a real threat. So your only option is to create a cartoon, a cartoon alternative, then run against the cartoon. Cartoons are two-dimensional, they're easy to absorb. Life in the real world is complicated and real change is hard. And a lot of people even think it's boring. Good for you, because earlier today you nominated the real one. Listen, we've got to get back on schedule. You guys calm down.Look, I have lived a long, full, blessed life, it really took off when I met and fell in love with that girl in the spring of 1971. When I was president, I worked hard to give you more peace and shared prosperity, to give you an America where nobody is invisible or counted out. But for this time, Hillary is uniquely qualified to seize the opportunities and reduce the risks we face. And she is still the best darn change-maker I have ever known. You could drop her into any trouble spot, pick one, come back in a month and somehow, some way she will have made it better. That is just who she is. There are clear, achievable, affordable responses to our challenges. But we won't get to them if America makes the wrong choice in this election. That's why you should elect her. And you should elect her because she'll never quit when the going gets tough. She'll never quit on you.She sent me in this primary to West Virginia where she knew we were going to lose, to look those coal miners in the eye and say I'm down here because Hillary sent me to tell you that if you really think you can get the economy back you had 50 years ago, have at it, vote for whoever you want to. But if she wins, she is coming back for you to take you along on the ride to America's future. And so I say to you, if you love this country, you're working hard, you're paying taxes and you're obeying the law and you'd like to become a citizen, you should choose immigration reform over somebody that wants to send you back. If you're a Muslim and you love America and freedom and you hate terror, stay here and help us win and make a future together. We want you. If you're a young African American disillusioned and afraid, we saw in Dallas how great our police officers can be, help us build a future where nobody is afraid to walk outside, including the people that wear blue to protect our future. Hillary will make us stronger together. You know it because she's spent a lifetime doing it. I hope you will do it. I hope you will elect her. Those of us who have more yesterdays than tomorrows tend to care more about our children and grandchildren. The reason you should elect her is that in the greatest country on earth we have always been about tomorrow. You children and grandchildren will bless you forever if you do.God bless you. Thank you.",clinton
"Warm greetings to everyone celebrating Hanukkah. Every year during the month of Kislev on the Hebrew calendar, Jews around the world celebrate the Festival of Lights. They remember with sorrow the desecration of the Holy Temple, with pride the triumph of the Maccabees over the forces of oppression, and with a renewed faith in God's providence the miracle of a day's worth of oil burning for eight straight days&mdash; a miracle commemorated by lighting the candles of the menorah. This year, Hanukkah is celebrated during the same week Christians celebrate Christmas and Muslims celebrate the Eid Al-Fitr. The coinciding of these special days, sacred to followers of the world's three Abrahamic faiths, serves as a powerful reminder of the fundamental values we share: a reverence for our Creator, a belief in human dignity, and a conviction that we must love our neighbors as ourselves. These ancient lessons still hold great meaning for us today, as the global community grows ever closer and American society becomes increasingly diverse. By taking them to heart at this blessed season, we can build a future where we respect one another's differences, embrace our shared values, and where all God's children live together in peace. Hillary joins me in extending best wishes to all for a joyous Hanukkah celebration. BILL CLINTON",clinton
"On behalf of the great state of Illinois, crossroads of a nation, Land of Lincoln, let me expressmy deepest gratitude for the privilege of addressing this convention. Tonight is a particular honor for me because, let   s face it, my presence on this stage is prettyunlikely. My father was a foreign student, born and raised in a small village in Kenya. He grewup herding goats, went to school in a tin-roof shack. His father -- my grandfather -- was acook, a domestic servant to the British. But my grandfather had larger dreams for his son. Through hard work and perseverance myfather got a scholarship to study in a magical place, America, that shone as a beacon offreedom and opportunity to so many who had come before. While studying here, my father met my mother. She was born in a town on the other side ofthe world, in Kansas. Her father worked on oil rigs and farms through most of the Depression.The day after Pearl Harbor my grandfather signed up for duty; joined Patton   s army, marchedacross Europe. Back home, my grandmother raised a baby and went to work on a bomberassembly line. After the war, they studied on the G.I. Bill, bought a house through F.H.A., andlater moved west all the way to Hawaii in search of opportunity. And they, too, had big dreams for their daughter. A common dream, born of two continents. My parents shared not only an improbable love, they shared an abiding faith in thepossibilities of this nation. They would give me an African name, Barack, or    blessed,   believing that in a tolerant America your name is no barrier to success. They imagined -- Theyimagined me going to the best schools in the land, even though they weren   t rich, because ina generous America you don   t have to be rich to achieve your potential. They're both passed away now. And yet, I know that on this night they look down on me withgreat pride. They stand here, and I stand here today, grateful for the diversity of my heritage, aware thatmy parents    dreams live on in my two precious daughters. I stand here knowing that my storyis part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me,and that, in no other country on earth, is my story even possible. Tonight, we gather to affirm the greatness of our Nation -- not because of the height of ourskyscrapers, or the power of our military, or the size of our economy. Our pride is based on avery simple premise, summed up in a declaration made over two hundred years ago: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they areendowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are Life,Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That is the true genius of America, a faith -- a faith in simple dreams, an insistence on smallmiracles; that we can tuck in our children at night and know that they are fed and clothed andsafe from harm; that we can say what we think, write what we think, without hearing asudden knock on the door; that we can have an idea and start our own business withoutpaying a bribe; that we can participate in the political process without fear of retribution, andthat our votes will be counted -- at least most of the time. This year, in this election we are called to reaffirm our values and our commitments, to holdthem against a hard reality and see how we're measuring up to the legacy of our forbearersand the promise of future generations. And fellow Americans, Democrats, Republicans, Independents, I say to you tonight: We havemore work to do -- more work to do for the workers I met in Galesburg, Illinois, who arelosing their union jobs at the Maytag plant that   s moving to Mexico, and now are having tocompete with their own children for jobs that pay seven bucks an hour; more to do for thefather that I met who was losing his job and choking back the tears, wondering how he wouldpay 4500 dollars a month for the drugs his son needs without the health benefits that hecounted on; more to do for the young woman in East St. Louis, and thousands more like her,who has the grades, has the drive, has the will, but doesn   t have the money to go to college. Now, don   t get me wrong. The people I meet -- in small towns and big cities, in diners andoffice parks -- they don   t expect government to solve all their problems. They know they haveto work hard to get ahead, and they want to. Go into the collar counties around Chicago, andpeople will tell you they don   t want their tax money wasted, by a welfare agency or by thePentagon. Go in -- Go into any inner city neighborhood, and folks will tell you thatgovernment alone can   t teach our kids to learn; they know that parents have to teach, thatchildren can   t achieve unless we raise their expectations and turn off the television sets anderadicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white. They know thosethings. People don   t expect -- People don't expect government to solve all their problems. But theysense, deep in their bones, that with just a slight change in priorities, we can make sure thatevery child in America has a decent shot at life, and that the doors of opportunity remain opento all. They know we can do better. And they want that choice. In this election, we offer that choice. Our Party has chosen a man to lead us who embodiesthe best this country has to offer. And that man is John Kerry. John Kerry understands the ideals of community, faith, and service because they   ve definedhis life. From his heroic service to Vietnam, to his years as a prosecutor and lieutenantgovernor, through two decades in the United States Senate, he's devoted himself to thiscountry. Again and again, we   ve seen him make tough choices when easier ones wereavailable. His values and his record affirm what is best in us. John Kerry believes in an America wherehard work is rewarded; so instead of offering tax breaks to companies shipping jobs overseas,he offers them to companies creating jobs here at home. John Kerry believes in an America where all Americans can afford the same health coverageour politicians in Washington have for themselves. John Kerry believes in energy independence, so we aren   t held hostage to the profits of oilcompanies, or the sabotage of foreign oil fields. John Kerry believes in the Constitutional freedoms that have made our country the envy ofthe world, and he will never sacrifice our basic liberties, nor use faith as a wedge to divide us. And John Kerry believes that in a dangerous world war must be an option sometimes, but itshould never be the first option. You know, a while back -- awhile back I met a young man named Shamus in a V.F.W. Hall inEast Moline, Illinois. He was a good-looking kid -- six two, six three, clear eyed, with an easysmile. He told me he   d joined the Marines and was heading to Iraq the following week. And asI listened to him explain why he   d enlisted, the absolute faith he had in our country and itsleaders, his devotion to duty and service, I thought this young man was all that any of usmight ever hope for in a child. But then I asked myself, ""Are we serving Shamus as well as he is serving us?"" I thought of the 900 men and women -- sons and daughters, husbands and wives, friends andneighbors, who won   t be returning to their own hometowns. I thought of the families I   ve metwho were struggling to get by without a loved one   s full income, or whose loved ones hadreturned with a limb missing or nerves shattered, but still lacked long-term health benefitsbecause they were Reservists. When we send our young men and women into harm   s way, we have a solemn obligation notto fudge the numbers or shade the truth about why they   re going, to care for their familieswhile they   re gone, to tend to the soldiers upon their return, and to never ever go to warwithout enough troops to win the war, secure the peace, and earn the respect of the world. Now -- Now let me be clear. Let me be clear. We have real enemies in the world. Theseenemies must be found. They must be pursued. And they must be defeated. John Kerry knowsthis. And just as Lieutenant Kerry did not hesitate to risk his life to protect the men whoserved with him in Vietnam, President Kerry will not hesitate one moment to use our militarymight to keep America safe and secure. John Kerry believes in America. And he knows that it   s not enough for just some of us toprosper -- for alongside our famous individualism, there   s another ingredient in the Americansaga, a belief that we   re all connected as one people. If there is a child on the south side ofChicago who can   t read, that matters to me, even if it   s not my child. If there is a seniorcitizen somewhere who can   t pay for their prescription drugs, and having to choose betweenmedicine and the rent, that makes my life poorer, even if it   s not my grandparent. If there   san Arab American family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process, thatthreatens my civil liberties. It is that fundamental belief -- It is that fundamental belief: I am my brother   s keeper. I ammy sister   s keeper that makes this country work. It   s what allows us to pursue our individualdreams and yet still come together as one American family. E pluribus unum: ""Out of many, one."" Now even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us -- the spin masters,the negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of ""anything goes."" Well, I say to themtonight, there is not a liberal America and a conservative America -- there is the United Statesof America. There is not a Black America and a White America and Latino America and AsianAmerica -- there   s the United States of America. The pundits, the pundits like to slice-and-dice our country into red states and blue states; redstates for Republicans, blue states for Democrats. But I   ve got news for them, too. Weworship an awesome God in the blue states, and we don   t like federal agents poking around inour libraries in the red states. We coach Little League in the blue states and yes, we   ve gotsome gay friends in the red states. There are patriots who opposed the war in Iraq and thereare patriots who supported the war in Iraq. We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance tothe stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America. In the end -- In the end -- In the end, that   s what this election is about. Do we participate in apolitics of cynicism or do we participate in a politics of hope? John Kerry calls on us to hope. John Edwards calls on us to hope. I   m not talking about blind optimism here -- the almost willful ignorance that thinksunemployment will go away if we just don   t think about it, or the health care crisis will solveitself if we just ignore it. That   s not what I   m talking about. I   m talking about something moresubstantial. It   s the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs; the hope ofimmigrants setting out for distant shores; the hope of a young naval lieutenant bravelypatrolling the Mekong Delta; the hope of a millworker   s son who dares to defy the odds; thehope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him, too. Hope -- Hope in the face of difficulty. Hope in the face of uncertainty. The audacity of hope! In the end, that is God   s greatest gift to us, the bedrock of this nation. A belief in things notseen. A belief that there are better days ahead. I believe that we can give our middle class relief and provide working families with a road toopportunity. I believe we can provide jobs to the jobless, homes to the homeless, and reclaim youngpeople in cities across America from violence and despair. I believe that we have a righteous wind at our backs and that as we stand on the crossroadsof history, we can make the right choices, and meet the challenges that face us. America! Tonight, if you feel the same energy that I do, if you feel the same urgency that Ido, if you feel the same passion that I do, if you feel the same hopefulness that I do -- if wedo what we must do, then I have no doubt that all across the country, from Florida to Oregon,from Washington to Maine, the people will rise up in November, and John Kerry will be swornin as President, and John Edwards will be sworn in as Vice President, and this country willreclaim its promise, and out of this long political darkness a brighter day will come. Thank you very much everybody. God bless you. Thank you.",obama
"Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  President.   Mr.  President,  on  Thursdays  Senator  Durbin  and  I  hold  a  constituent  coffee  so  we  can  hear   from  the  folks  back  home.  A  young  man  came  a  few  months  ago  who  was  about  25,  26  years   old.  He  had  been  back  from  Iraq  for  a  year.  The  first  six  months  of  that  year  had  been  spent   in  a  coma.  An  explosion  had  shattered  his  face,  blinded  him  in  both  eyes,  has  left  him  without   the  use  of  one  arm.   He  talked  to  us  about  how  he  was  going  through  rehab.  He  introduced  us  to  his  family.  He  has   a  wife  and  two  young  daughters  like  I  do,  and  his  wife  talked  for  a  bit  about  the  adjustments   they  were  making  at  home  since  dad  got  hurt.  And  I  found  myself  looking  at  not  just  him,  but   his  wife,  who  loves  him  so  much.  And  I  thought  about  how  their  lives  were  forever  changed   because  of  the  decision  that  was  carried  out  four  years  ago.   The  sacrifices  of  war  are  immeasurable.  I  first  made  this  point  in  the  fall  of  2002,  at  the  end  of   the  speech  that  I  gave  opposing  the  invasion  of  Iraq.  I  said  then  that  I  certainly  do  not  oppose   all  wars.  Rather,  I  oppose  dumb  wars,  rash  wars,  wars  that  are  based  on  passion  as  opposed   to  wars  based  on  a  sober  assessment  of  our  national  security  interests,  because  there's  no   decision  more  profound  than  the  one  we  make  to  send  our  brave  men  and  women  into  harm   s   way. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.  Property  of     Copyright    2010.  All  rights  reserved.   Page  1      I   ve  thought  about  these  words  from  time  to  time  since  that  speech,  but  never  so  much  as  the   day  I  saw  that  young  man  and  his  wife,  and  understood  the  degree  to  which  their  lives  had   been  turn  upside  down.   The  sacrifices  of  war  are  immeasurable.  Too  many  have  returned  from  Iraq  with  that  soldier   s   story        with  broken  bodies  and  shattered  nerves  and  wounds  that  even  the  best  care  may  not   heal.  Too  many  of  our  best  have  come  home  shrouded  in  the  flag  they  loved.  Too  many  moms   and  dads  and  husbands  and  wives  have  answered  that  knock  on  the  door  that   s  hardest  for   any  loved  one  to  hear.  And  the  rest  of  us  have  seen  too  many  promises  of  swift  victories  and   dying  insurgencies  and  budding  democracy  giving  way  to  the  reality  of  a  brutal  civil  war  that   goes  on  and  on  and  on  to  this  day.   The  sacrifices  of  war,  Mr.  President,  are  immeasurable.  It  was  not  impossible  to  see  back  then   that  we  might  arrive  at  the  place  we   re  at  today.  I  said  then  that  a  war  based  not  on  reason   but  on  passion,  not  on  principle  but  on  politics  would  lead  to  a  U.S.  occupation  of   undetermined  length,  at  undetermined  cost,  with  undetermined  consequences.  I  believed  that   an  invasion  of  Iraq  without  a  clear  rationale  or  strong  international  support  would  only   strengthen  the  recruitment  arm  of  al  Qaeda  and  erode  the  good  standing  and  moral  authority   that  took  our  country  generations  to  build.  There  were  other  experts  and  leaders  and   everyday  Americans  who  believed  this  too.   I  wish  I  had  been  wrong.  I  wish  we  weren   t  here  talking  about  this  at  the  beginning  of  the   war   s  fifth  year        because  the  consequences  of  this  war  have  been  profound.  And  the   sacrifices  have  been  immeasurable.   Mr.  President,  those  who  would  have  us  continue  this  war  in  perpetuity  like  to  say  that  this  is   a  matter  of  resolve  on  behalf  of  the  American  people.  But  the  American  people  have  been   extraordinarily  resolved.  They've  seen  their  sons  and  daughters  killed  and  wounded  on  the   streets  of  Fallujah.  They've  spent  hundreds  of  billions  of  dollars  on  this  effort        money  that   could  have  been  devoted  to  strengthening  our  homeland  and  our  competitive  standing  as  a   nation.   It  is  not  a  failure  of  resolve  that  has  led  us  into  this  chaos  but  a  failed  strategy        a  strategy   that  has  only  strengthened  Iran   s  strategic  position,  increased  threats  posed  by  terrorist   organizations,  reduced  U.S.  credibility  and  influence  around  the  world,  and  placed  Israel  and   other  nations  [friendly]  to  the  United  States  in  the  region  in  greater  peril.  Iraq  has  not  been  a   failure  of  resolve    it  has  been  a  failure  of  strategy,  and  that  strategy  must  change.  It  is  time   to  bring  a  responsible  end  to  U.S.  involvement  in  this  conflict  is  now.   It's  become  apparent,  Mr.  President,  that  there's  no  military  solution  to  this  war.  No  amount   of  U.S.  soldiers        not  10,000  more,  not  20,000  more,  not  almost  30,000  more  than  we  know   we  are  sending        can  solve  the  grievances  that  lay  at  the  heart  of  someone  else   s  civil  war.

Page  2      Our  troops  cannot  serve  as  their  diplomats,  and  we  can  no  longer  referee  their  civil  war.  We   must  begin  a  phased  withdrawal  of  our  forces  starting  May  1st,  with  the  goal  of  removing  all   combat  forces  by  March  30th,  2008.   We  also  must  make  sure  that  we   re  not  as  careless  getting  out  of  this  war  as  we  were  getting   in,  and  that   s  why  this  withdrawal  should  be  gradual,  and  maintain  some  U.S.  troops  in  the   region  to  prevent  a  wider  war  in  the  region,  while  they  can  also  work  on  going  after  Al  Qaeda   and  other  terrorists.  But  this  phased  withdrawal,  Mr.  President,  must  begin  soon.  Letting  the   Iraqis  know  that  we  will  not  be  there  forever  is  our  last,  best  hope  to  pressure  the  Iraqis  to   take  ownership  of  their  country  and  bring  an  end  to  their  conflict.  It  is  time  for  our  troops  to   start  coming  home.   History  will  not  judge,  Mr.  President,  the  architects  of  this  war  kindly.  But  the  books  have  yet   to  be  written  on  our  effort  to  right  the  wrongs  we  see  in  Iraq.  The  story  has  yet  to  be  told   about  how  we  turned  from  this  moment,  found  our  way  out  of  the  desert,  and  took  to  heart   the  lessons  of  war  that  too  many  refused  to  heed  back  then    for  it  is  of  little  use  or  comfort  to   recall  past  advice  and  warnings  if  we  do  not  allow  them  to  guide  us  in  the  challenges  that  lie   ahead.  Mr.  President,  threats  loom  large  in  an  age  where  terrorist  networks  thrive,  and  there   will  certainly  be  times  when  we  have  to  call  on  our  brave  servicemen  and  women  to  risk  their   lives  again.   But  before  we  make  that  most  profound  of  all  decisions,  before  we  send  our  best  off  to  battle,   we  must  remember  what  led  us  to  this  day  and  learn  from  the  principles  that  follow.   We  must  remember  that  ideology  is  not  a  foreign  policy.  We  must  not  embark  on  a  war  based   on  untested  theories,  political  agendas,  or  wishful  thinking  that  has  little  basis  in  fact  or   reality.  We  must  focus  our  efforts  on  the  threats  we  know  exist,  and  we  must  evaluate  those   threats  with  sound  intelligence  that  is  never  manipulated  for  political  reasons.   Mr.  President,  we  must  remember  that  the  cost  of  going  it  alone  is  immense.  It  is  a  choice  we   sometimes  have  to  make,  but  one  that  must  be  made  rarely  and  always  reluctantly.  That's   because  America   s  standing  in  the  world  is  a  precious  resource  not  easily  rebuilt.  We  value  the   cooperation  and  goodwill  of  other  nations  not  because  it  makes  us  feel  good,  but  because  it   makes  all  the  world  safer    because  the  only  way  to  battle  21st  century  threats  that  race   across  the  borders        threats  like  terror  and  disease  and  nuclear  proliferation        is  to  enlist  the   resources  and  support  of  all  nations.  To  win  our  wider  struggle,  we  must  let  people  across  this   planet  know  that  there  is  another,  more  hopeful  alternative  to  the  hateful  ideologies  the   terrorists  espouse  and  a  renewed  America  will  reflect  and  champion  that  vision.   Mr.  President,  we  must  remember  that  planning  for  peace  is  just  as  critical  as  planning  for   war.  Iraq  was  not  just  a  failure  of  conception  but  a  failure  of  execution,  and  so  when  a  conflict   does  arise  that  requires  our  involvement,  we  must  understand  that  country   s  history,  its   politics,  its  ethnic  and  religious  divisions  before  our  troops  ever  set  foot  on  its  soil. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.  Property  of     Copyright    2010.  All  rights  reserved.   Page  3      We  must  understand  that  setting  up  ballot  boxes  does  not  a  democracy  make        that  real   freedom  and  real  stability  come  from  doing  the  hard  work  of  helping  to  build  a  strong  police   force,  and  a  legitimate  government,  and  ensuring  that  people  have  food,  and  water,  and   electricity,  and  basic  services.  And  we  must  be  honest  about  how  much  of  that  we  can  do   ourselves  and  how  much  must  come  from  the  people  themselves.   Finally,  Mr.  President,  we  must  remember  that  when  we  send  our  servicemen  and  women  to   war,  we  make  sure  we  give  them  the  training  they  need,  and  the  equipment  that  will  keep   them  safe,  and  a  mission  that  they  can  accomplish.  We  must  respect  our  commanders     advice   not  just  when  its  politically  convenient,  but  even  when  it   s  not  what  we  want  to  hear.  And   when  our  troops  come  home,  it  is  our  most  solemn  responsibility  to  make  sure  they  come   home  to  the  services,  and  the  benefits,  and  the  care  they  deserve.   As  we  stand  at  the  beginning  of  the  fifth  year  of  this  war,  Mr.  President,  let  us  remember  that   young  man  from  Illinois,  and  his  wife,  and  his  daughters,  and  the  thousands  upon  thousands   of  families  who  are  living  the  very  real  consequences  and  immeasurable  sacrifices  that  have   come  from  our  decision  to  invade  Iraq.  We  are  so  blessed  in  this  country  to  have  so  many   men  and  women  like  this        Americans  willing  to  put  on  that  uniform,  and  say  the  hard   goodbyes,  and  risk  their  lives  in  a  far  off  land  because  they  know  that  such  consequences  and   sacrifices  are  sometimes  necessary  to  defend  our  country  and  achieve  a  lasting  peace.   That  is  why  we  have  no  greater  responsibility  than  to  ensure  the  decision  to  place  them  in   harm   s  way  is  the  right  one.  And  that  is  why  we  must  learn  the  lessons  of  Iraq.  It  is  what  we   owe  our  soldiers.  It  is  what  we  owe  their  families.  And  it  is  what  we  owe  our  country        now,   and  all  the  days  and  months  to  come.   Thank  you,  Mr.  President.  I  yield  the  floor. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.

"I love you back. [to audience] A little less than one year from today, you will go into the voting booth and you will select thePresident of the United States of America. Now, here   s the good news -- the name George W.Bush will not be on the ballot. The name of my cousin Dick Cheney will not be on the ballot.We   ve been trying to hide that for a long time. Everybody has a black sheep in the family. Theera of Scooter Libby justice, and Brownie incompetence, and Karl Rove politics will finally beover. But the question you   re going to have to ask yourself when you caucus in January and youvote in November is,    What   s next for America?    We are in a defining moment in ourhistory. Our nation is at war. The planet is in peril. The dream that so many generationsfought for feels as if it   s slowly slipping away. We are working harder for less. We   ve neverpaid more for health care or for college. It   s harder to save and it   s harder to retire. And mostof all we   ve lost faith that our leaders can or will do anything about it. We were promised compassionate conservatism and all we got was Katrina and wiretaps. Wewere promised a uniter, and we got a President who could not even lead the half of thecountry that voted for him. We were promised a more ethical and more efficient government,and instead we have a town called Washington that is more corrupt and more wasteful than itwas before. And the only mission that was ever accomplished is to use fear and falsehood totake this country to a war that should have never been authorized and should have neverbeen waged. It is because of these failures that America is listening, intently, to what we say here today --not just Democrats, but Republicans and Independents who   ve lost trust in their government,but want to believe again. And it is because of these failures that we not only have a momentof great challenge, but also a moment of great opportunity. We have a chance to bring thecountry together in a new majority -- to finally tackle problems that George Bush made farworse, but that had festered long before George Bush ever took office -- problems that we   vetalked about year after year after year after year. And that is why the same old Washington textbook campaigns just won   t do in this election. That   s why not answering questions    cause we are afraid our answers won   t be popular justwon   t do. That   s why telling the American people what we think they want to hear instead oftelling the American people what they need to hear just won   t do. Triangulating and poll- driven positions because we   re worried about what Mitt or Rudy might say about us just won   tdo. If we are really serious about wining this election Democrats, we can   t live in fear of losingit. This party -- the party of Jefferson and Jackson, of Roosevelt and Kennedy -- has alwaysmade the biggest difference in the lives of the American people when we led, not by polls, butby principle; not by calculation, but by conviction; when we summoned the entire nation to acommon purpose -- a higher purpose. And I run for the Presidency of the United States ofAmerica because that   s the party America needs us to be right now. A party that offers not just a difference in policies, but a difference in leadership. A party that doesn   t just focus on how to win but why we should. A party that doesn   t just offer change as a slogan, but real, meaningful change -- change thatAmerica can believe in. That   s why I   m in this race. That   s why I am running for the Presidency of the United States ofAmerica -- to offer change that we can believe in. I am in this race to tell the corporate lobbyists that their days of setting the agenda inWashington are over. I have done more than any other candidate in this race to take onlobbyists -- and won. They have not funded my campaign, they will not get a job in my WhiteHouse, and they will not drown out the voices of the American people when I am President. I   m in this race to take those tax breaks away from companies that are moving jobs overseasand put them in the pockets of hard working Americans who deserve it. And I won   t raise theminimum wage every ten years -- I will raise it to keep pace so that workers don   t    fall behind. That is why I am in it. To protect the American worker. To fight for the American worker. I   m in this race because I want to stop talking about the outrage of 47 million Americanswithout health care and start actually doing something about it. I expanded health care inIllinois by bringing Democrats and Republicans together. By taking on the insuranceindustry. And that is how I will make certain that every single American in this country hashealth care they can count on and I won   t do it twenty years from now, I won   t do it ten yearsfrom now, I will do it by the end of my first term as President of the United States of America. I run for president to make sure that every American child has the best education that wehave to offer -- from the day they are born to the day they graduate from college. And I won   tjust talk about how great teachers are -- as President I will reward them for their greatness --by raising salaries and giving them more support. That   s why I   m in this race. I am running for President because I am sick and tired of democrats thinking that the onlyway to look tough on national security is by talking, and acting, and voting like George BushRepublicans. When I am this party   s nominee, my opponent will not be able to say that I voted for the warin Iraq; or that I gave George Bush the benefit of the doubt on Iran; or that I supported Bush- Cheney policies of not talking to leaders that we don   t like. And he will not be able to say thatI wavered on something as fundamental as whether or not it is ok for America to torture --because it is never ok. That   s why I am in it. As President, I will end the war in Iraq. We will have our troops home in sixteen months. I willclose Guantanamo. I will restore habeas corpus. I will finish the fight against Al Qaeda. And Iwill lead the world to combat the common threats of the 21st century -- nuclear weapons andterrorism; climate change and poverty; genocide and disease. And I will send once more amessage to those yearning faces beyond our shores that says,    You matter to us. Your futureis our future. And our moment is now.    America, our moment is now. Our moment is now. I don   t want to spend the next year or thenext four years re-fighting the same fights that we had in the 1990s. I don   t want to pit RedAmerica against Blue America, I want to be the President of the United States of America. And if those Republicans come at me with the same fear-mongering and swift-boating thatthey usually do, then I will take them head on. Because I believe the American people aretired of fear and tired of distractions and tired of diversions. We can make this election notabout fear, but about the future. And that won   t just be a Democratic victory; that will be anAmerican victory. And that is a victory America needs right now. I am not in this race to fulfill some long-held ambitions or because I believe it   s somehowowed to me. I never expected to be here, I always knew this journey was improbable. I   venever been on a journey that wasn   t. I am running in this race because of what Dr. King called   the fierce urgency of now.    Because I believe that there   s such a thing as being too late. And that hour is almost upon us. I don   t want to wake up four years from now and find out that millions of Americans still lackhealth care because we couldn   t take on the insurance industry. I don   t want to see that the oceans have risen a few more inches. The planet has reached apoint of no return because we couldn   t find a way to stop buying oil from dictators. I don   t want to see more American lives put at risk because no one had the judgment or thecourage to stand up against a misguided war before we sent our troops into fight. I don   t want to see homeless veterans on the streets. I don   t want to send another generationof American children to failing schools. I don   t want that future for my daughters. I don   t wantthat future for your sons. I do not want that future for America. I   m in this race for the same reason that I fought for jobs for the jobless and hope for thehopeless on the streets of Chicago; for the same reason I fought for justice and equality as acivil rights lawyer; for the same reason that I fought for Illinois families for over a decade. Because I will never forget that the only reason that I   m standing here today is becausesomebody, somewhere stood up for me when it was risky. Stood up when it was hard. Stoodup when it wasn   t popular. And because that somebody stood up, a few more stood up. Andthen a few thousand stood up. And then a few million stood up. And standing up, with courageand clear purpose, they somehow managed to change the world. That   s why I   m running, Iowa -- to give our children and grandchildren the same chancessomebody gave me. That   s why I   m running, Democrats -- to keep the American Dream alive for those who stillhunger for opportunity, who still thirst for equality. That   s why I   m asking you to stand with me, that   s why I   m asking you to caucus for me,that   s why I am asking you to stop settling for what the cynics say we have to accept. In this election -- in this moment -- let us reach for what we know is possible. A nationhealed. A world repaired. An America that believes again. Thank you very much everybody.",obama
"Thank you, Iowa.You know, they said this day would never come. They said our sights were set too high. They said this country was too divided, too disillusioned to ever come together around acommon purpose. But on this January night, at this defining moment in history, you have done what the cynicssaid we couldn't do. You have done what the state of New Hampshire can do in five days. Youhave done what America can do in this new year, 2008.In lines that stretched around schools and churches, in small towns and in big cities, youcame together as Democrats, Republicans, and independents, to stand up and say that we areone nation. We are one people. And our time for change has come.You said the time has come to move beyond the bitterness and pettiness and anger that'sconsumed Washington; to end the political strategy that's been all about division, and insteadmake it about addition; to build a coalition for change that stretches through red states andblue states; because that's how we'll win in November, and that's how we'll finally meet thechallenges that we face as a nation. Transcription date 2012 by Michael E. Eidenmuller. Copyright Status: Restrictions unknown. We are choosing hope over fear. We're choosing unity over division, and sending a powerfulmessage that change is coming to America.You said the time has come to tell the lobbyists who think their money and their influencespeak louder than our voices that they don't own this government -- we do. And we are hereto take it back.The time has come for a President who will be honest about the choices and the challenges weface, who will listen to you and learn from you, even when we disagree, who won't just tellyou what you want to hear, but what you need to know. And in New Hampshire, if you giveme the same chance that Iowa did tonight, I will be that President for America.I'll be a President who finally makes health care affordable and available to every singleAmerican, the same way I expanded health care in Illinois, by bringing Democrats andRepublicans together to get the job done. I'll be a President who ends the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas and puta middle-class tax cut into the pockets of working Americans who deserve it.I'll be a President who harnesses the ingenuity of farmers and scientists and entrepreneurs tofree this nation from the tyranny of oil once and for all.And I'll be a President who ends this war in Iraq and finally brings our troops home, whorestores our moral standing, who understands that 9/11 is not a way to scare up votes but achallenge that should unite America and the world against the common threats of the 21stcentury -- common threats of terrorism and nuclear weapons, climate change and poverty,genocide and disease.Tonight, we are one step closer to that vision of America because of what you did here inIowa. And so I'd especially like to thank the organizers and the precinct captains, thevolunteers and the staff who made this all possible. And while I'm at it on thank you's, I think it makes sense for me to thank the love of my life,the rock of the Obama family, the closer on the campaign trail: Give it up for Michelle Obama.I know you didn't do this for me. You did this because you believed so deeply in the mostAmerican of ideas -- that in the face of impossible odds, people who love this country canchange it. I know this. I know this because while I may be standing here tonight, I'll never forget thatmy journey began on the streets of Chicago doing what so many of you have done for thiscampaign and all the campaigns here in Iowa: organizing and working and fighting to makepeople's lives just a little bit better. Transcription date 2012 by Michael E. Eidenmuller. Copyright Status: Restrictions unknown. I know how hard it is. It comes with little sleep, little pay, and a lot of sacrifice. There aredays of disappointment. But sometimes, just sometimes, there are nights like this: a nightthat, years from now, when we've made the changes we believe in, when more families canafford to see a doctor, when our children -- when Malia and Sasha and your children inherit aplanet that's a little cleaner and safer, when the world sees America differently, and Americasees itself as a nation less divided and more united, you'll be able to look back with pride andsay that this was the moment when it all began.This was the moment when the improbable beat what Washington always said was inevitable.This was the moment when we tore down barriers that have divided us for too long; when werallied people of all parties and ages to a common cause; when we finally gave Americans whohad never participated in politics a reason to stand up and to do so.This was the moment when we finally beat back the politics of fear and doubt and cynicism,the politics where we tear each other down instead of lifting this country up. This was themoment.Years from now, you'll look back and you'll say that this was the moment, this was the placewhere America remembered what it means to hope. For many months, we've been teased,even derided for talking about hope. But we always knew that hope is not blind optimism. It'snot ignoring the enormity of the tasks ahead or the roadblocks that stand in our path.It's not sitting on the sidelines or shirking from a fight. Hope is that thing inside us thatinsists, despite all the evidence to the contrary, that something better awaits us if we havethe courage to reach for it and to work for it and to fight for it.Hope is what I saw in the eyes of the young woman in Cedar Rapids who works the night shiftafter a full day of college and still can't afford health care for a sister who's ill -- a youngwoman who still believes that this country will give her the chance to live out her dreams.Hope is what I heard in the voice of the New Hampshire woman who told me that she hasn'tbeen able to breathe since her nephew left for Iraq -- who still goes to bed each night prayingfor his safe return.Hope is what led a band of colonists to rise up against an empire, what led the greatest ofgenerations to free a continent and heal a nation, what led young women and young men tosit at lunch counters and brave fire hoses and march through Selma and Montgomery forfreedom's cause. Hope is what led me here today. With a father from Kenya, a mother from Kansas, and astory that could only happen in the United States of America. Transcription date 2012 by Michael E. Eidenmuller. Copyright Status: Restrictions unknown. Hope is the bedrock of this nation -- the belief that our destiny will not be written for us, butby us, by all those men and women who are not content to settle for the world as it is, whohave the courage to remake the world as it should be.That is what we started here in Iowa and that is the message we can now carry to NewHampshire and beyond; the same message we had when we were up and when we weredown; the one that can save this country, brick by brick, block by block, calloused hand bycalloused hand; that together, ordinary people can do extraordinary things.Because we are not a collection of red states and blue states. We are the United States ofAmerica. And in this moment, in this election, we are ready to believe again.Thank you, Iowa. Transcription date 2012 by Michael E. Eidenmuller.

"[Introductory remarks] Scripture tells us that when Joshua and the Israelites arrived at the gates of Jericho, theycould not enter. The walls of the city were too steep for any one person to climb. They weretoo strong to be taken down by brute force. And so, the people sat for days, unable to pass onthrough; but God had a plan for His People. He told them to stand together and marchtogether around the city, and on the seventh day he told them that when they heard thesound of the ram   s horn, they should speak with one voice. And, at the chosen hour when thehorn sounded and a chorus of voices cried out together, the mighty walls of Jericho cametumbling down. That   s what scripture tells us. And there are many lessons to take from this passage, just as there are many lessons to takefrom this day, just as there are many memories that fill the space of this church. As I wasthinking about which ones we needed to remember at this hour, my mind went back to thevery beginning of the modern Civil Rights era. Because before Memphis and the mountaintop,before the bridge in Selma and the march on Washington, before Birmingham and thebeatings, the fire hoses, and the loss of those four little girls, before there was King the iconand his magnificent dream, there was King the young preacher and a people who foundthemselves suffering under the yolk of oppression. And on the eve of the bus boycotts in Montgomery, at a time when many were still doubtful about the possibilities of change, a timewhen there were those in the black community who not only mistrusted each other, butmistrusted themselves -- King inspired with words not of anger, but of an urgency, a fierceurgency that still speaks to us today.    Unity,    he said,    is the great need of the hour.       Unityis the great need of the hour.    Unity is how we shall overcome. What Dr. King understood is that if just one person chose to walk instead of ri[de] the bus,those walls of oppression would not be moved. But maybe if a few more decided to walk,those foundations might start to shake. If just a few women were willing to do what RosaParks had been willing to do, maybe the cracks in those walls would start to show. Ifteenagers took rides from North to South, maybe a few bricks would come loose. Maybe ifwhite folks marched because they   d come to understand that their freedom was wrapped up inthe freedom of others, that they too had a stake in the impending battle, the walls wouldbegin to sway, and if enough Americans were awakened to injustice, if they joined togetherNorth and South, rich and poor, Jew and Gentile, then perhaps that wall would come tumblingdown, and justice would flow like waters of righteousness, like a mighty stream.    Unity is thegreat need of the hour.    That   s what Dr. King said. It is the great need of this hour as well,not because it sounds pleasant, not because it makes us feel good, but because it's the onlyway we can overcome the essential deficit that exits in this country. I   m not talking about the budget deficit. I   m not talking about the trade deficit. Talking aboutthe moral deficit in this country. I   m talking about an empathy deficit, the inability torecognize ourselves in one another, to understand that we are our brother   s keeper and oursister   s keeper, that in the words of Dr. King,    We are all tied together in a single garment ofdestiny.    We have an empathy deficit when we   re still sending our children down corridors ofshame, schools in the forgotten corners of America where the color of your skin still affectsthe content of your education. We have a deficit when CEOs are making more in ten minutes than ordinary workers aremaking in an entire year, when families lose their homes so unscrupulous lenders can make aprofit, when mothers can   t afford a doctor when their children are stricken with illness. We have a deficit in this country when we have Scooter Libby justice for some and Jenajustice for others, when our children see hanging nooses from a school yard tree today, in thepresent, in the 21st century. We have a deficit when homeless veterans sleep on the streets of our cities, when innocentsare slaughtered in the deserts of Darfur, when young Americans serve tour after tour aftertour after tour of duty in a war that should have never been authorized and should have neverbeen waged. We have an empathy deficit in this country that has to be closed. We have a deficit when ittakes a breach in the levees to reveal the breach in our compassion, when it takes a terriblestorm to reveal the hungry that God calls on us to feed, the sick that He calls on us to carefor, the least of these that He commands that we treat as our own. So, we have a deficit toclose. We have walls, barriers to justice and equality that must come down, and to do this, weknow that    unity is the great need of the hour.    However, all too often, when we talk about unity in this country, we   ve come to believe that itcan be purchased on the cheap. We   ve come to believe that racial reconciliation can comeeasily; that it   s just a matter of a few ignorant people trapped in the prejudices of the past,and that if the demagogues and those who would exploit our racial divisions will simply goaway then all our problems will be solved. All too often, we seek to ignore the profoundstructural and institutional barriers that stand in the way of insuring opportunity for all of ourchildren, or decent jobs for all of our people, or health care for those who are sick. We offerunity, but we are not willing to pay the price that's required Of course, true unity cannot be so easily purchased. It starts with a change in attitudes. Itstarts with changing our hearts, and changing our minds, broadening our spirit. It   s not easyto stand in somebody else   s shoes. It   s not easy to see past our own differences. We   ve allencountered this in our own lives. What makes it even more difficult is that we have a politicsin this country that seeks to drive us apart, that puts up walls between us. We are told thatthose who differ from us on a few things, differ from us on all things, that our problems arethe fault of those who don   t think like us or look like us or come from where we do. TheWelfare Queen, she   s taking our money. The Immigrant, he   s taking our jobs. The believercondemns the nonbeliever as immoral, and the nonbeliever chides the believer for beingintolerant. And for most of this country   s history, we in the African-American community have been atthe receiving end of man   s inhumanity to man. And all of us understand insidious -- All of usunderstand intimately the insidious role that race still sometimes plays on the job and in theschools, in our health care system, and in our criminal justice system. And yet, if we are honest with ourselves, we must admit that none of our hands are entirelyclean. If we   re honest with ourselves, we'll acknowledge that our own community has notalways been true to King   s vision of a beloved community. If we   re honest with ourselves, wehave to admit that there have been times when we've scorned our gay brothers and sistersinstead of embracing them. The scourge of anti-Semitism has at times revealed itself in ourcommunity. For too long, some of us have seen immigrants only as competitors for jobsinstead of companions in the fight for opportunity. Everyday our politics fuels and exploits thiskind of division across all races and regions, across gender and party. It is played out ontelevision; it is sensationalized by the media. Last week, it crept into the campaign forPresident with charges and countercharges that serve to obscure the issues instead ofilluminating the critical choices we face as a nation. None of our hands are clean. So let us say that on this day of all days, each of us carries with us the task of changing ourhearts and minds. The divisions, the stereotypes, the scapegoating, the ease with which weblame the plight of ourselves on others -- all of that distracts us from the common challengesthat we face, war and poverty, inequality and injustice. We can no longer afford to buildourselves up by tearing each other down. We can no longer afford to traffic in lies or fear orhate. It's the poison that we must purge from our politics, the wall that we must tear downbefore the hour grows too late. Because if Dr. King could love his jailer, if he could call on thefaithful, who once sat where you do, to forgive those who had set dogs and fire hoses uponthem, then surely we can look past what divides us in our time and bind up our wounds anderase the sympathy deficit that exists in our hearts. But if changing our hearts and our minds is the first critical step, we cannot stop there. It   snot enough to bemoan the plight of the poor in this country and remain unwilling to push ourelected officials to provide the resources to fix our schools. It's not enough to decry thedisparities of health care and yet allow the insurance companies and the drug companies toblock real reform in our health care system. It   s not enough -- It   s not enough for us to abhorthe costs of a misguided war, and yet we continue to allow ourselves to be driven by a politicsof fear that sees the threat of an attack as a way to scare up votes instead of a call to cometogether in a common effort. Scripture tells us that we are judged not just by word but by deed. And if we are truly to bringabout the unity that is needed, that is so crucial in this time, we have to find it withinourselves to act on what we know, to understand that living up to this country   s ideals and itspossibilities is going to require great effort and great resources, sacrifice and stamina. Wecan   t pass a law called No Child Left Behind and then leave the money behind. That is not aserious effort in bringing about the unity that is needed. We can   t celebrate Dr. King   s dream,and yet still have insufficient funds to cash that promissory note that was promised at thebeginning of this nation. That is what is at stake in this great debate we are having today. Changes that are neededare not just a matter of tinkering around the edges. They will not come if politicians simply tellus what we want to hear. All of us will be called upon to make some sacrifice. None of us willbe exempt from responsibility. We've had to fight to fix our schools, but we also have tochallenge ourselves to be better parents, and turn off the television set, and put away thevideo game, and our men have to be home with our children. That, too, is part of thechallenge that we must make. We will have to confront the biases in our criminal justice system, but we also have toacknowledge the deep-seeded violence that still resides in our own communities, in too manyof the hearts of our young people, and we have to break the grip of that violence wherever wesee it. That   s how we   re going to bring about the change that we seek. That   s how Dr. King ledthis country through the wilderness. He did it with words, words that he spoke not just to the children of slaves but the children ofslave owners, words that inspired not just black but also white, not just Christian but also Jewand Muslim and Buddhists and Atheists, not just the southerner but also the northerner. Heled with words, but he also led with deeds. He also led by example. He led by marching andgoing to jail and suffering threats and beatings and being away from his family. He led bytaking a stand against a war knowing full well that it would diminish his popularity. He led bychallenging our economic structures, understanding that it would cause discomfort. Dr. Kingunderstood that unity cannot be won on the cheap, that we would have to earn it throughgreat effort and determination. That   s the unity, the hard earned unity that we need rightnow. That is the effort, the determination that can transform blind optimism into hope. You know people have remarked on the fact that I talk about hope a lot in my campaign. Youknow they -- they tease me a little bit. Some have been scornful. They say,    Ah, he   s talkingabout hope again. He   s so idealistic. He   s so na  ve. He   s a hope monger.    That   s okay. It   strue. I talk about hope. I talk about it a lot because the odds of me standing here today are sosmall, so remote that I couldn   t of gotten here without some hope. You know my -- my daddyleft me when I was two years old. I needed some hope to get here. I was raised by a singlemother. I needed some hope to get here. I got in trouble when I was a teenager, did somethings folks now like to talk about. I needed some hope to get here. I wasn   t born into money,or great wealth, or great privilege, or status. I was given love, an education, and some hope.That   s what I got. That   s my birthright. So I talk about hope. I -- I put    Hope    on my campaign signs. It doesn   t even have my nameon them sometimes -- just says    Hope.    Folks don   t know who they   re voting for, but it makesthem feel good. Say, you know, huh? I spoke about hope at the Democratic Convention. I -- Iwrote a book called The Audacity of Hope. And so I -- so I   m puzzled when -- when somepeople, some of the other candidates make a mockery of the idea. They say I   m pedaling falsehopes. ""Get a reality check,"" they tell me. And I have to -- I have to try to understand whatthey're saying. The implication is is that if you are hopeful, that you somehow must beengaging in wishful thinking. Your -- Your head must be in the clouds; that you must bepassive and just sit back and wait for things to happen to you. That seems to be theimplication. And so I have to explain to people that   s not what hope is. Hope is not blind optimism. Hope isnot ignorance of the barriers and hurdles and hazards that stand in your way. Hope   s just theopposite. I know how hard it will be to provide health care to every single American. Theinsurance companies, drug companies, they don   t want to give up their profits. I know it won   tbe easy to have a energy policy that makes sense for America because the oil companies likewriting the energy bills. I know that alleviating poverty, or making sure all our children canlearn, or eliminating the scourge of racism in our society -- none of those things lendthemselves to simple solutions. I know because I fought on the streets as a community organizer in poor neighborhoods onthe Southside of Chicago alongside those without jobs or without prospects for the future. Ihave fought in the courts as a civil rights attorney for those who had been denied opportunityon the job or denied access to the ballot box. I   ve seen good legislation die because -- Well,I   ve seen that too -- I   ve seen good legislation die because good intentions weren   t enough,because they weren   t fortified with a political majority and political will. I   ve seen this country-- this country   s judgment clouded by fear. I know how easily a country can be misled when itis afraid. I know how hard it is. Everybody here understands how difficult it is to bring abouttrue change, change that we can believe in. But I also know this -- that nothing in this countryworthwhile has ever happened except somebody somewhere decided to hope. That   s how this country was founded because a group of patriots decided they were going totake on the British Empire. Nobody was putting their money on them. That   s how slaves andabolitionists resisted that evil system. That   s how a new President was able to chart a courseto insure that this nation would no longer remain half slave and half free. That   s how thegreatest generation defeated Fascism and overcame a Great Depression. That   s how womenwon the right to vote. That   s how workers won the right to organize. That   s how young peopleand old people and middle-aged folks were willing to walk instead of ride the bus, and folkscame down on Freedom Rides. They marched, and they sat in, and they were beaten and firehouses were sent on them, and dogs were sent on them, and some went to jail, and somedied for freedom's cause. That   s what hope is. Imagining and then fighting for and strugglingfor and sometimes dying for what didn   t seem possible before. There   s nothing na  ve aboutthat. There are no false hopes in that. I don   t believe in false hopes. Imagine if John F. Kennedy had looked up at the moon andsaid, ""Well, that   s too far."" False hopes, we can   t go there. If Dr. King had stood on the LincolnMemorial and said, ""Y   all go home; we can   t overcome."" There   s no such thing as false hopes,but what I know deep in my heart is that we cannot bring about change unless we are unified,unless we do it together. Change does not happen from the top down -- in America oranywhere else. It happens from the bottom up. It happens because ordinary people dreamextraordinary things. It   s because all of you decide that change must come. That I know. It wasn   t just one voice -- It wasn't just one voice that shouted out before the walls of Jericho.All the voices came together, a chorus of voices. That   s what gives me hope: not just thosewho ascend to high office, but the changes that are happening in ordinary places. The storiesthat give me my hope don   t happen in the spotlight. When I think about Dr. King, I suspect hewas sustained not by having dinner with Presidents; not by getting the Nobel Peace Prize; butcoming back to church and seeing the mothers of the church and the deacons. Those whomaintained their dignity were standing up straight in the face of injustice. That   s where hedrew his hope. He saw God in their faces. Those stories don   t happen on a presidential stage;they happen in the quiet quarters of our lives. They happen in the moments we least expect.So, let me close by giving an example of one of those stories. There is a young woman, 23 years old, white woman, named Ashley Baia, who organizes forour campaign in Florence, South Carolina. Ashley has been working to organize mostly blackfolks. She   s in Florence, South Carolina. She   s been doing it since the beginning of thecampaign, and the other day she...set up a round table discussion where everyone aroundwas telling their story about who they were and why they were there. And so, Ashleyexplained, she started things off, by explaining why she was there. And she explained thatwhen she was nine years old her mother got cancer, and because she had to miss a day ofwork she was let go; and she lost her health care; and then she had to file for bankruptcy.They were on hard times, and that   s when Ashley, nine-years-old at the time, decided she hadto do something to help her mom, and she knew that food was one of their most expensivecosts. They didn   t have a lot of money. Ashley lived in a poor household. And so Ashley convinced her mother that she really liked and really wanted to eat more thananything else mustard and relish sandwiches. She had heard that condiments like mustardand relish were cheap. And she -- she concocted in her own mind at the age of nine that shewould convince her mother that that   s the only thing she wanted to eat everyday, because shefigured that would be a way of saving money for the family and helping them alleviate theirhardships. So she did this for a year until her mom got better. And in that round table she toldeveryone that the reason she joined our campaign was so that she could help millions of otherchildren in the country who want and need to help their parents too. She had heard me speakabout my mother having cancer and having to worry about maybe not getting the health careshe needed because of a preexisting condition, and she had connected with that. She thought,maybe Barack would fight for my mother. And if he would fight for my mother, then maybe Iwill fight alongside him. That   s what had brought her to Florence. So Ashley finishes her story and then goes around the room and asks everyone else whythey   re supporting the campaign. They all have different stories and different reasons: somebring up specific issues; some talk about, upset about, affirmative action; some talk about,you know, ""I want to see more jobs in the community""; some are frustrated about trade;some just like me. So they all got a bunch of different reasons, and finally, at the end of this discussion, theycome to this elderly black man. He   s been sitting there quiet the whole time, hasn   t beensaying a word. And Ashley asks him why is he there. And he doesn   t bring up a specific issue.He does not say healthcare or the economy. He doesn   t talk about the Iraq War. He doesn   tsay anything about education. He doesn   t say that he   s there because he likes Barack Obama,or he   s proud of the possibility of the first African American President. He simply says toeveryone in the room,    I am here because of Ashley. I am here because of this young girl,and the fact that she's willing to fight for what she believes in. And that reminds me that I stillhave some fight left in me, and I   m going stand up for what I believe in.    Now, by itself, that single moment of recognition between that young white girl and that oldblack man, that   s not enough to change a country. By itself, it   s not enough to give healthcare to the sick or jobs to the jobless or education to our children, but it is where we begin. It   s why I believe that the walls in that room began to shake at that moment. And if they canshake in that room, then they can shake here in Atlanta, and if they can shake in Atlanta,then they can shake in the state of Georgia, and if they can shake in Georgia, they can shakeall across America. And if enough of our voices join together, if we see each other in eachother   s eyes, we can bring those walls tumbling down. The walls of Jericho can finally cometumbling down. That is our hope, but only if we pray together, if we work together, and if we march together.Ebenezer, we cannot walk alone. Brothers and sisters, we cannot walk alone. In the strugglefor justice and for equality, we cannot walk alone. In the struggle for opportunity and justice,we cannot walk alone. In the struggle to heal this nation and repair the world, we cannot walkalone. So I ask you to walk with me and march with me and join your voices with mine, andtogether we will sing the song that tears down the walls that divide us and lift up an Americathat is truly indivisible with liberty and justice for all. May God bless the memory of the great pastor of this church. And may God bless the United States of America. Thank you. Thank you.",obama
"Let me begin by thanking Harris Wofford for his contributions to this country. In so manydifferent ways, he exemplifies what we mean by the word ""citizen."" And so we are verygrateful to him for all the work he has done; and I'm thankful for the gracious and thoughtfulintroduction. ""We the people, in order to form a more perfect union."" Two hundred and twenty one yearsago, in a hall that still stands across the street, a group of men gathered and, with thesesimple words, launched America's improbable experiment in democracy. Farmers andscholars, statesmen and patriots who had traveled across the ocean to escape tyranny andpersecution finally made real their Declaration of Independence at a Philadelphia conventionthat lasted through the spring of 1787. The document they produced was eventually signed, but ultimately unfinished. It was stainedby this nation's original sin of slavery, a question that divided the colonies and brought theconvention to a stalemate until the founders chose to allow the slave trade to continue for atleast 20 more years, and to leave any final resolution to future generations. Of course, theanswer to the slavery question was already embedded within our Constitution -- aConstitution that had at is very core the ideal of equal citizenship under the law; aConstitution that promised its people liberty and justice, and a union that could be and shouldbe perfected over time. And yet words on a parchment would not be enough to deliver slaves from bondage, orprovide men and women of every color and creed their full rights and obligations as citizens ofthe United States. What would be needed were Americans in successive generations who werewilling to do their part -- through protests and struggles, on the streets and in the courts,through a civil war and civil disobedience, and always at great risk -- to narrow that gapbetween the promise of our ideals and the reality of their time. This was one of the tasks we set forth at the beginning of this presidential campaign: tocontinue the long march of those who came before us, a march for a more just, more equal,more free, more caring, and more prosperous America. I chose to run for President at thismoment in history because I believe deeply that we cannot solve the challenges of our timeunless we solve them together, unless we perfect our union by understanding that we mayhave different stories, but we hold common hopes; that we may not look the same and maynot have come from the same place, but we all want to move in the same direction: towards abetter future for our children and our grandchildren. And this belief comes from my unyieldingfaith in the decency and generosity of the American people. But it also comes from my ownstory. I'm the son of a black man from Kenya and a white woman from Kansas. I was raised with thehelp of a white grandfather who survived a Depression to serve in Patton's army during WorldWar II, and a white grandmother who worked on a bomber assembly line at Fort Leavenworthwhile he was overseas. I've gone to some of the best schools in America and I've lived in oneof the world's poorest nations. I am married to a black American who carries within her theblood of slaves and slave owners, an inheritance we pass on to our two precious daughters. Ihave brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews, uncles, and cousins of every race and every huescattered across three continents. And for as long as I live, I will never forget that in no othercountry on earth is my story even possible. It's a story that hasn't made me the mostconventional of candidates. But it is a story that has seared into my genetic makeup the ideathat this nation is more than the sum of its parts -- that out of many, we are truly one. Now throughout the first year of this campaign, against all predictions to the contrary, we sawhow hungry the American people were for this message of unity. Despite the temptation toview my candidacy through a purely racial lens, we won commanding victories in states withsome of the whitest populations in the country. In South Carolina, where the Confederate flagstill flies, we built a powerful coalition of African Americans and white Americans. This is not tosay that race has not been an issue in this campaign. At various stages in the campaign, somecommentators have deemed me either ""too black"" or ""not black enough."" We saw racialtensions bubble to the surface during the week before the South Carolina primary. The presshas scoured every single exit poll for the latest evidence of racial polarization, not just interms of white and black, but black and brown as well. And yet, it's only been in the last couple of weeks that the discussion of race in this campaignhas taken a particularly divisive turn. On one end of the spectrum, we've heard the implicationthat my candidacy is somehow an exercise in affirmative action; that it's based solely on thedesire of wild and wide-eyed liberals to purchase racial reconciliation on the cheap. On theother end, we've heard my former pastor, Jeremiah Wright, use incendiary language toexpress views that have the potential not only to widen the racial divide, but views thatdenigrate both the greatness and the goodness of our nation and that rightly offend white andblack alike. Now I've already condemned, in unequivocal terms, the statements of Reverend Wright thathave caused such controversy, and in some cases, pain. For some, nagging questions remain:Did I know him to be an occasionally fierce critic of American domestic and foreign policy? Ofcourse. Did I ever hear him make remarks that could be considered controversial while I sat inthe church? Yes. Did I strongly disagree with many of his political views? Absolutely, just asI'm sure many of you have heard remarks from your pastors, priests, or rabbis with which youstrongly disagree. But the remarks that have caused this recent firestorm weren't simply controversial. Theyweren't simply a religious leader's efforts to speak out against perceived injustice. Instead,they expressed a profoundly distorted view of this country, a view that sees white racism asendemic and that elevates what is wrong with America above all that we know is right withAmerica; a view that sees the conflicts in the Middle East as rooted primarily in the actions ofstalwart allies like Israel instead of emanating from the perverse and hateful ideologies ofradical Islam. As such, Reverend Wright's comments were not only wrong but divisive, divisive at a timewhen we need unity; racially charged at a time when we need to come together to solve a setof monumental problems: two wars, a terrorist threat, a falling economy, a chronic healthcare crisis, and potentially devastating climate change -- problems that are neither black orwhite or Latino or Asian, but rather problems that confront us all. Given my background, my politics, and my professed values and ideals, there will no doubt bethose for whom my statements of condemnation are not enough. Why associate myself withReverend Wright in the first place, they may ask? Why not join another church? And I confessthat if all that I knew of Reverend Wright were the snippets of those sermons that have run inan endless loop on the television sets and YouTube, if Trinity United Church of Christconformed to the caricatures being peddled by some commentators, there is no doubt that Iwould react in much the same way. But the truth is, that isn't all that I know of the man. The man I met more than twenty yearsago is a man who helped introduce me to my Christian faith, a man who spoke to me aboutour obligations to love one another, to care for the sick and lift up the poor. He is a man who served his country as a United States Marine, and who has studied andlectured at some of the finest universities and seminaries in the country, and who over 30years has led a church that serves the community by doing God's work here on Earth -- byhousing the homeless, ministering to the needy, providing day care services and scholarshipsand prison ministries, and reaching out to those suffering from HIV/AIDS. In my first book, Dreams From My Father, I described the experience of my first service atTrinity, and it goes as follows: People began to shout, to rise from their seats and clap and cry out, a forceful windcarrying the reverend's voice up to the rafters. And in that single note -- hope -- I heard something else; at the foot of that cross,inside the thousands of churches across the city, I imagined the stories of ordinaryblack people merging with the stories of David and Goliath, Moses and Pharaoh, theChristians in the lion's den, Ezekiel's field of dry bones. Those stories of survival and freedom and hope became our stories, my story. Theblood that spilled was our blood; the tears our tears; until this black church, on thisbright day, seemed once more a vessel carrying the story of a people into futuregenerations and into a larger world. Our trials and triumphs became at once uniqueand universal, black and more than black. In chronicling our journey, the stories andsongs gave us a meaning to reclaim memories that we didn't need to feel shame about-- memories that all people might study and cherish and with which we could start torebuild. That has been my experience at Trinity. Like other predominantly black churches across thecountry, Trinity embodies the black community in its entirety -- the doctor and the welfaremom, the model student and the former gang-banger. Like other black churches, Trinity'sservices are full of raucous laughter and sometimes bawdy humor. They are full of dancingand clapping and screaming and shouting that may seem jarring to the untrained ear. Thechurch contains in full the kindness and cruelty, the fierce intelligence and the shockingignorance, the struggles and successes, the love and, yes, the bitterness and biases thatmake up the black experience in America. And this helps explain, perhaps, my relationship with Reverend Wright. As imperfect as hemay be, he has been like family to me. He strengthens my faith, officiated my wedding, andbaptized my children. Not once in my conversations with him have I heard him talk about anyethnic group in derogatory terms or treat whites with whom he interacted with anything butcourtesy and respect. He contains within him the contradictions -- the good and the bad -- ofthe community that he has served diligently for so many years. I can no more disown him than I can disown the black community. I can no more disown himthan I can disown my white grandmother, a woman who helped raise me, a woman whosacrificed again and again for me, a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything inthis world, but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed her by on thestreet, and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that mademe cringe. These people are part of me. And they are part of America, this country that I love. Now, some will see this as an attempt to justify or excuse comments that are simplyinexcusable. I can assure you it is not. And I suppose the politically safe thing to do would beto move on from this episode and just hope that it fades into the woodwork. We can dismissReverend Wright as a crank or a demagogue, just as some have dismissed Geraldine Ferraroin the aftermath of her recent statements as harboring some deep -- deep-seated bias. But race is an issue that I believe this nation cannot afford to ignore right now. We would bemaking the same mistake that Reverend Wright made in his offending sermons aboutAmerica: to simplify and stereotype and amplify the negative to the point that it distortsreality. The fact is that the comments that have been made and the issues that have surfacedover the last few weeks reflect the complexities of race in this country that we've never reallyworked through, a part of our union that we have not yet made perfect. And if we walk awaynow, if we simply retreat into our respective corners, we will never be able to come togetherand solve challenges like health care or education or the need to find good jobs for everyAmerican. Understanding -- Understanding this reality requires a reminder of how we arrived at thispoint. As William Faulkner once wrote, ""The past isn't dead and buried. In fact, it isn't evenpast."" We do not need to recite here the history of racial injustice in this country. But we doneed to remind ourselves that so many of the disparities that exist between the African- American community and the larger American community today can be traced directly toinequalities passed on from an earlier generation that suffered under the brutal legacy ofslavery and Jim Crow. Segregated schools were, and are, inferior schools. We still haven'tfixed them, 50 years after Brown versus Board of Education. And the inferior education theyprovided, then and now, helps explain the pervasive achievement gap between today's blackand white students. Legalized discrimination, where blacks were prevented, often through violence, from owningproperty, or loans were not granted to African-American business owners, or blackhomeowners could not access FHA mortgages, or blacks were excluded from unions, or thepolice force, or the fire department meant that black families could not amass any meaningfulwealth to bequeath to future generations. That history helps explain the wealth and incomegap between blacks and whites and the concentrated pockets of poverty that persist in somany of today's urban and rural communities. A lack of economic opportunity among black men and the shame and frustration that camefrom not being able to provide for one's family contributed to the erosion of black families, aproblem that welfare policies for many years may have worsened. And the lack of basicservices in so many urban black neighborhoods -- parks for kids to play in, police walking thebeat, regular garbage pick-up, building code enforcement -- all helped create a cycle ofviolence, blight, and neglect that continues to haunt us. This is the reality in which Reverend Wright and other African-Americans of his generationgrew up. They came of age in the late '50s and early '60s, a time when segregation was stillthe law of the land and opportunity was systematically constricted. What's remarkable is nothow many failed in the face of discrimination, but how many men and women overcame theodds, how many were able to make a way out of no way for those like me who would comeafter them. But for all those who scratched and clawed their way to get a piece of the American Dream,there were many who didn't make it -- those who were ultimately defeated, in one way oranother, by discrimination. That legacy of defeat was passed on to future generations -- thoseyoung men and increasingly young women who we see standing on street corners orlanguishing in our prisons, without hope or prospects for the future. Even for those blacks whodid make it, questions of race, and racism, continue to define their world view in fundamentalways. For the men and women of Reverend Wright's generation, the memories of humiliationand doubt and fear have not gone away, nor has the anger and the bitterness of those years. That anger may not get expressed in public, in front of white co-workers or white friends, butit does find voice in the barbershop or the beauty shop or around the kitchen table. At times,that anger is exploited by politicians to gin up votes along racial lines or to make up for apolitician's own failings. And occasionally it finds voice in the church on Sunday morning, inthe pulpit and in the pews. The fact that so many people are surprised to hear that anger insome of Reverend Wright's sermons simply reminds us of that old truism that the mostsegregated hour of American life occurs on Sunday morning. That -- That anger is not always productive. Indeed, all too often it distracts attention fromsolving real problems. It keeps us from squarely facing our own complicity within the African- American community in our own condition. It prevents the African-American community fromforging the alliances it needs to bring about real change. But the anger is real; it is powerful,and to simply wish it away, to condemn it without understanding its roots only serves towiden the chasm of misunderstanding that exists between the races. In fact, a similar anger exists within segments of the white community. Most working andmiddle-class white Americans don't feel that they've been particularly privileged by their race.Their experience is the immigrant experience. As far as they're concerned, no one handedthem anything; they built it from scratch. They've worked hard all their lives, many times onlyto see their jobs shipped overseas or their pensions dumped after a lifetime of labor. They areanxious about their futures, and they feel their dreams slipping away. And in an era of stagnant wages and global competition, opportunity comes to be seen as azero sum game, in which your dreams come at my expense. So when they are told to bustheir children to a school across town, when they hear that an African American is getting anadvantage in landing a good job or a spot in a good college because of an injustice that theythemselves never committed, when they're told that their fears about crime in urbanneighborhoods are somehow prejudice, resentment builds over time. Like the anger within the black community, these resentments aren't always expressed inpolite company. But they have helped shape the political landscape for at least a generation.Anger over welfare and affirmative action helped forge the Reagan Coalition. Politiciansroutinely exploited fears of crime for their own electoral ends. Talk show hosts andconservative commentators built entire careers unmasking bogus claims of racism whiledismissing legitimate discussions of racial injustice and inequality as mere political correctnessor reverse racism. And just as black anger often proved counterproductive, so have thesewhite resentments distracted attention from the real culprits of the middle class squeeze: acorporate culture rife with inside dealing, questionable accounting practices, and short-termgreed; a Washington dominated by lobbyists and special interests; economic policies thatfavor the few over the many. And yet, to wish away the resentments of white Americans, tolabel them as misguided or even racist without recognizing they are grounded in legitimateconcerns, this, too, widens the racial divide and blocks the path to understanding. This is where we are right now. It's a racial stalemate we've been stuck in for years. And contrary to the claims of some of mycritics, black and white, I have never been so naive as to believe that we can get beyond ourracial divisions in a single election cycle or with a single candidate, particularly -- particularly acandidacy as imperfect as my own. But I have asserted a firm conviction, a conviction rootedin my faith in God and my faith in the American people, that, working together, we can movebeyond some of our old racial wounds and that, in fact, we have no choice -- we have nochoice if we are to continue on the path of a more perfect union. For the African-American community, that path means embracing the burdens of our pastwithout becoming victims of our past. It means continuing to insist on a full measure of justicein every aspect of American life. But it also means binding our particular grievances, for betterhealth care and better schools and better jobs, to the larger aspirations of all Americans -- thewhite woman struggling to break the glass ceiling, the white man who's been laid off, theimmigrant trying to feed his family. And it means also taking full responsibility for our ownlives -- by demanding more from our fathers, and spending more time with our children, andreading to them, and teaching them that while they may face challenges and discrimination intheir own lives, they must never succumb to despair or cynicism. They must always believe --They must always believe that they can write their own destiny. Ironically, this quintessentially American -- and, yes, conservative -- notion of self-help foundfrequent expression in Reverend Wright's sermons. But what my former pastor too often failedto understand is that embarking on a program of self-help also requires a belief that societycan change. The profound mistake of Reverend Wright's sermons is not that he spoke aboutracism in our society. It's that he spoke as if our society was static, as if no progress had beenmade, as if this country -- a country that has made it possible for one of his own members torun for the highest office in the land and build a coalition of white and black, Latino, Asian,rich, poor, young and old -- is still irrevocably bound to a tragic past. What we know, what wehave seen, is that America can change. That is true genius of this nation. What we havealready achieved gives us hope -- the audacity to hope -- for what we can and must achievetomorrow. Now, in the white community, the path to a more perfect union means acknowledging thatwhat ails the African-American community does not just exist in the minds of black people;that the legacy of discrimination -- and current incidents of discrimination, while less overtthan in the past -- that these things are real and must be addressed. Not just with words, butwith deeds -- by investing in our schools and our communities; by enforcing our civil rightslaws and ensuring fairness in our criminal justice system; by providing this generation withladders of opportunity that were unavailable for previous generations. It requires allAmericans to realize that your dreams do not have to come at the expense of my dreams,that investing in the health, welfare, and education of black and brown and white children willultimately help all of America prosper. In the end, then, what is called for is nothing more and nothing less than what all the world'sgreat religions demand: that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us. Let us beour brother's keeper, Scripture tells us. Let us be our sister's keeper. Let us find that commonstake we all have in one another, and let our politics reflect that spirit as well. For we have a choice in this country. We can accept a politics that breeds division and conflictand cynicism. We can tackle race only as spectacle, as we did in the O.J. trial; or in the wakeof tragedy, as we did in the aftermath of Katrina; or as fodder for the nightly news. We canplay Reverend Wright's sermons on every channel every day and talk about them from nowuntil the election, and make the only question in this campaign whether or not the Americanpeople think that I somehow believe or sympathize with his most offensive words. We canpounce on some gaffe by a Hillary supporter as evidence that she's playing the race card; orwe can speculate on whether white men will all flock to John McCain in the general electionregardless of his policies. We can do that. But if we do, I can tell you that in the next election,we'll be talking about some other distraction, and then another one, and then another one.And nothing will change. That is one option. Or, at this moment, in this election, we can come together and say, ""Not this time."" This timewe want to talk about the crumbling schools that are stealing the future of black children andwhite children and Asian children and Hispanic children and Native-American children. Thistime we want to reject the cynicism that tells us that these kids can't learn; that those kidswho don't look like us are somebody else's problem. The children of America are not ""thosekids,"" -- they are our kids, and we will not let them fall behind in a 21st-century economy. Notthis time. This time we want to talk about how the lines in the emergency room are filled withwhites and blacks and Hispanics who do not have health care, who don't have the power ontheir own to overcome the special interests in Washington, but who can take them on if we doit together. This time we want to talk about the shuttered mills that once provided a decent life for menand women of every race, and the homes for sale that once belonged to Americans fromevery religion, every region, every walk of life. This time we want to talk about the fact thatthe real problem is not that someone who doesn't look like you might take your job; it's thatthe corporation you work for will ship it overseas for nothing more than a profit. This time --This time we want to talk about the men and women of every color and creed who servetogether, and fight together, and bleed together under the same proud flag. We want to talkabout how to bring them home from a war that should've never been authorized andshould've never been waged. And we want to talk about how we'll show our patriotism bycaring for them, and their families, and giving them the benefits that they have earned. I would not be running for President if I didn't believe with all my heart that this is what thevast majority of Americans want for this country. This union may never be perfect, butgeneration after generation has shown that it can always be perfected. And today, whenever Ifind myself feeling doubtful or cynical about this possibility, what gives me the most hope isthe next generation -- the young people whose attitudes and beliefs and openness to changehave already made history in this election. There's one story in particular that I'd like to leave you with today, a story I told when I hadthe great honor of speaking on Dr. King's birthday at his home church, Ebenezer Baptist, inAtlanta. There's a young, 23-year-old woman, a white woman named Ashley Baia, whoorganized for our campaign in Florence, South Carolina. She'd been working to organize amostly African-American community since the beginning of this campaign, and one day shewas at a roundtable discussion where everyone went around telling their story and why theywere there. And Ashley said that when she was 9 years old, her mother got cancer. Andbecause she had to miss days of work, she was let go and lost her health care. They had tofile for bankruptcy, and that's when Ashley decided that she had to do something to help hermom. She knew that food was one of their most expensive costs, and so Ashley convinced hermother that what she really liked and really wanted to eat more than anything else wasmustard and relish sandwiches -- because that was the cheapest way to eat. That's the mindof a 9 year old. She did this for a year until her mom got better. And so Ashley told everyone at theroundtable that the reason she had joined our campaign was so that she could help themillions of other children in the country who want and need to help their parents too. Now, Ashley might have made a different choice. Perhaps somebody told her along the waythat the source of her mother's problems were blacks who were on welfare and too lazy towork, or Hispanics who were coming into the country illegally. But she didn't. She sought outallies in her fight against injustice. Anyway, Ashley finishes her story and then goes around the room and asks everyone else whythey're supporting the campaign. They all have different stories and different reasons. Manybring up a specific issue. And finally they come to this elderly black man who's been sittingthere quietly the entire time. And Ashley asks him why he's there. And he doesn't bring up aspecific issue. He does not say health care or the economy. He does not say education or thewar. He does not say that he was there because of Barack Obama. He simply says toeveryone in the room, ""I am here because of Ashley."" ""I'm here because of Ashley."" Now, by itself, that single moment of recognition between that young white girl and that oldblack man is not enough. It is not enough to give health care to the sick, or jobs to thejobless, or education to our children. But it is where we start. It is where our union growsstronger. And as so many generations have come to realize over the course of the 221 yearssince a band of patriots signed that document right here in Philadelphia, that is whereperfection begins. Thank you very much, everyone. Thank you.",obama
"Thank  you.  What  a  wonderful  reception.  Thank  you,  Saint  Paul.  Thank  you,  Minnesota.   Thank  you,  JoAnn  Syverson  for  the  wonderful  introduction.   Thank  you,  Michelle  Obama  and  Malia  Obama  and  Sasha  Obama.  Thank  you  to  my  brothers   and  sisters.  Thank  you  to  my  staff.  Thank  you  to  our  volunteers.  Thank  you  to  my  political   team.  Thank  you  to  our  campaign  manager,  David  Plouffe,  who  never  gets  any  credit,  but  has   built  the  best  political  organization  in  the  country.   Thank  you  to  my  grandmother,  who  helped  raise  me,  and  is  sitting  in  Hawaii  somewhere  right   now  because  she  can't  travel,  but  who  poured  everything  she  had  into  me,  and  who  helped  to   make  me  the  man  I  am  today.  Tonight  is  for  her.   Tonight,  Minnesota,  after  54  hard  fought  contests,  our  primary  season  has  finally  come  to  an   end.  Sixteen  months  have  passed  since  we  first  stood  together  on  the  steps  of  the  Old  State   Capitol  in  Springfield,  Illinois.  Thousands  of  miles  have  been  traveled    millions  of  voices  have   been  heard.   And  because  of  what  you  said,  because  you  decided  that  change  must  come  to  Washington,   because  you  believed  that  this  year  must  be  different  than  all  the  rest,  because  you  chose  to   listen  not  to  your  doubts  or  your  fears,  but  to  your  greatest  hopes  and  highest  aspirations,   tonight  we  mark  the  end  of  one  historic  journey  with  the  beginning  of  another,  a  journey  that   will  bring  a  new  and  better  day  to  America.  Because  of  you,  tonight  I  can  stand  here  and  say   that  I  will  be  the  Democratic  nominee  for  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Copyright  Status:  Restricted,  seek  permission.    2010   Page  1      I  want  to  thank  all  those  in  Montana  and  South  Dakota  who  stood  up  for  change  today.  I  want   to  thank  every  American  who  stood  with  us  over  the  course  of  this  campaign,  through  the   good  days  and  the  bad,  from  the  snows  of  Cedar  Rapids  to  the  sunshine  of  Sioux  Falls.  And,   tonight,  I  also  want  to  thank  the  men  and  woman  who  took  this  journey  with  me  as  fellow   candidates  for  President.   At  this  defining  moment  for  our  nation,  we  should  be  proud  that  our  Party  put  forth  one  of  the   most  talented,  qualified  field  of  individuals  ever  to  run  for  office.  I  have  not  just  competed   with  them  as  rivals.  I   ve  learned  from  them  as  friends,  as  public  servants,  and  as  patriots  who   love  America  and  are  willing  to  work  tirelessly  to  make  this  country  better.  They  are  leaders  of   this  Party  and  leaders  that  America  will  turn  to  for  years  to  come.   And  that  is  particularly  true  for  the  candidate  who  has  traveled  further  on  this  journey  than   anyone  else:  Senator  Hillary  Clinton  has  made  history  in  this  campaign.  She  has  made  history   not  just  because  she   s  a  woman  who  has  done  what  no  woman  has  done  before,  but  because   she  is  a  leader  who  inspires  millions  of  Americans  with  her  strength,  her  courage,  and  her   commitment  to  the  causes  that  brought  us  here  tonight.  I  congratulate  her  on  her  victory  in   South  Dakota,  and  I  congratulate  her  on  the  race  that  she  has  run  throughout  this  contest.   We   ve  certainly  had  our  differences  over  the  last  16  months.  But  as  someone  who   s  shared  a   stage  with  her  many  times,  I  can  tell  you  that  what  gets  Hillary  Clinton  up  in  the  morning         even  in  the  face  of  tough  odds        is  exactly  what  sent  her  and  Bill  Clinton  to  sign  up  for  their   first  campaign  in  Texas  all  those  years  ago,  what  sent  her  to  work  at  the  Children   s  Defense   Fund  and  made  her  fight  for  health  care  as  first  lady,  what  led  her  to  the  United  States  Senate   and  fueled  her  barrier  breaking  campaign  for  the  presidency:  an  unyielding  desire  to  improve   the  lives  of  ordinary  Americans,  no  matter  how  difficult  the  fight  may  be.   And  you  can  rest  assured  that  when  we  finally  win  the  battle  for  universal  health  care  in  this   country        and  we  will  win  that  fight        she  will  be  central  to  that  victory.  When  we  transform   our  energy  policy  and  lift  our  children  out  of  poverty,  it  will  be  because  she  worked  to  help   make  it  happen.  Our  Party  and  our  country  are  better  off  because  of  her,  and  I  am  a  better   candidate  for  having  had  the  honor  to  compete  with  Hillary  Rodham  Clinton.   There  are  those  who  say  that  this  primary  has  somehow  left  us  weaker  and  more  divided.   Well,  I  say  that,  because  of  this  primary,  there  are  millions  of  Americans  who've  cast  their   ballot  for  the  very  first  time.  There  are  Independents  and  Republicans  who  understand  this   election  isn   t  just  about  a  change  of  Party  in  Washington,  but  also  about  the  need  to  change   Washington.  There  are  young  people,  and  African  Americans,  and  Hispanic  Americans,  and   women  of  all  ages  who  have  voted  in  numbers  that  have  broken  records  and  inspired  a  nation.   All  of  you  chose  to  support  a  candidate  you  believe  in  deeply.  But  at  the  end  of  the  day,  we   aren   t  the  reason  you  came  out  and  waited  in  lines  that  stretched  block  after  block  to  make   your  voice  heard.  You  didn   t  do  that  because  of  me  or  Senator  Clinton  or  anyone  else.  You  did   it  because  you  know  in  your  hearts  that  at  this  moment,  a  moment  that  will  define  a   generation,  we  cannot  afford  to  keep  doing  what  we   ve  been  doing.  We  owe  our  children  a   better  future.  We  owe  our  country  a  better  future. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Copyright  Status:  Restricted,  seek  permission.    2010   Page  2      And  for  all  those  who  dream  of  that  future  tonight,  I  say:  Let  us  begin  the  work  together.  Let   us  unite  in  common  effort  to  chart  a  new  course  for  America.   In  just  a  few  short  months,  the  Republican  Party  will  arrive  in  St.  Paul  with  a  very  different   agenda.  They  will  come  here  to  nominate  John  McCain,  a  man  who  has  served  this  country   heroically.  I  honor,  we  honor  the  service  of  John  McCain,  and  I  respect  his  many   accomplishments,  even  if  he  chooses  to  deny  mine.  My  differences  with  him  are  not  personal.   They  are  with  the  policies  he  has  proposed  in  this  campaign,  because  while  John  McCain  can   legitimately  tout  moments  of  independence  from  his  Party  in  the  past,  such  independence  has   not  been  the  hallmark  of  his  presidential  campaign.   It   s  not  change  when  John  McCain  decided  to  stand  with  George  Bush  95  percent  of  the  time,   as  he  did  in  the  Senate  last  year.   It   s  not  change  when  he  offers  four  more  years  of  Bush  economic  policies  that  have  failed  to   create  well  paying  jobs,  or  insure  our  workers,  or  help  Americans  afford  the  skyrocketing  cost   of  college,  policies  that  have  lowered  the  real  incomes  of  the  average  American  family,  and   widened  the  gap  between  Wall  Street  and  Main  Street,  and  left  our  children  with  a  mountain   of  debt.   It   s  not  change  when  he  promises  to  continue  a  policy  in  Iraq  that  asks  everything  of  our   brave  men  and  women  in  uniform  and  nothing  of  Iraqi  politicians,  a  policy  where  all  we  look   for  are  reasons  to  stay  in  Iraq,  while  we  spend  billions  of  dollars  a  month  on  a  war  that  isn   t   making  the  American  people  any  safer.  So,  I   ll  say  this:  There  are  many  words  to  describe   John  McCain   s  attempt  to  pass  off  his  embrace  of  George  Bush   s  policies  as  bipartisan  and   new,  but     change     is  not  one  of  them.     Change     is  not  one  of  them,  because  change  is  a   foreign  policy  that  doesn   t  begin  and  end  with  a  war  that  should   ve  never  been  authorized  and   never  been  waged.   I  won   t  stand  here  and  pretend  that  there  are  many  good  options  left  in  Iraq,  but  what   s  not   an  option  is  leaving  our  troops  in  that  country  for  the  next  hundred  years,  especially  at  a  time   when  our  military  is  overstretched,  our  nation  is  isolated,  and  nearly  every  other  threat  to   America  is  being  ignored.  We  must  be  as  careful  getting  out  of  Iraq  as  we  were  careless   getting  in,  but  start  leaving  we  must.  It   s  time  for  Iraqis  to  take  responsibility  for  their  future.   It   s  time  to  rebuild  our  military  and  give  our  veterans  the  care  and  the  benefits  they  deserve   when  they  come  home.   It's  time  to  refocus  our  efforts  on  Al  Qaida   s  leadership  and  Afghanistan,  and  rally  the  world   against  the  common  threats  of  the  21st  century:  terrorism  and  nuclear  weapons,  climate   change  and  poverty,  genocide  and  disease.  That   s  what  change  is.   Change,  Minnesota,  is  realizing  that  meetings  [sic]  today   s  threats  requires  not  just  our   firepower,  but  the  power  of  our  diplomacy:  tough,  direct  diplomacy,  where  the  President  of   the  United  States  isn   t  afraid  to  let  any  petty  dictator  know  where  America  stands  and  what   we  stand  for.  We  must  once  again  have  the  courage  and  the  conviction  to  lead  the  free  world. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Copyright  Status:  Restricted,  seek  permission.    2010   Page  3      That  is  the  legacy  of  Roosevelt  and  Truman  and  Kennedy.  That   s  what  the  American  people   demand.  That   s  what  change  is.   Change  is  building  an  economy  that  rewards  not  just  wealth,  but  the  work  and  the  workers   who  created  it.  It   s  understanding  that  the  struggles  facing  working  families  can   t  be  solved  by   spending  billions  of  dollars  on  more  tax  breaks  for  big  corporations  and  wealthy  CEOs,  but  by   giving  a  middle  class  tax  break  to  those  who  need  it,  and  investing  in  our  crumbling   infrastructure,  and  transforming  how  we  use  energy,  and  improving  our  schools,  and  renewing   our  commitment  to  science  and  innovation.  It   s  understanding  that  fiscal  responsibility  and   shared  prosperity  can  go  hand  in  hand,  as  they  did  when  Bill  Clinton  was  President.   John  McCain  has  spent  a  lot  of  time  talking  about  trips  to  Iraq  in  the  last  few  weeks,  but   maybe  if  he  spent  some  time  taking  trips  to  the  cities  and  towns  that  have  been  hardest  hit  by   this  economy        cities  in  Michigan,  and  Ohio,  and  right  here  in  Minnesota        he   d  understand   the  kind  of  change  that  people  are  looking  for.   Maybe  if  he  went  to  Iowa  and  met  the  student  who  works  the  night  shift  after  a  full  day  of   class  and  still  can   t  pay  the  medical  bills  for  a  sister  who   s  ill,  he   d  understand  she  can   t  afford   four  more  years  of  a  health  care  plan  that  only  takes  care  of  the  healthy  and  the  wealthy.  She   needs  us  to  pass  health  care  right  now,  a  plan  that  guarantees  insurance  to  every  American   who  wants  it  and  brings  down  premiums  for  every  family  who  needs  it.  That   s  the  change  we   need,  Minnesota.   Maybe  if  John  McCain  went  to  Pennsylvania  and  he  met  the  man  who  lost  his  job,  but  can   t   even  afford  the  gas  to  drive  around  and  look  for  a  new  one,  he   d  understand  we  can   t  afford   four  more  years  of  our  addiction  to  oil  from  dictators.  That  man  needs  us  to  pass  an  energy   policy  that  works  with  automakers  to  raise  fuel  standards,  and  makes  corporations  pay  for   their  pollution,  and  oil  companies  invest  their  record  profits  in  a  clean  energy  future,  an   energy  policy  that  will  create  millions  of  new  jobs  that  pay  well  and  can   t  be  outsourced.   That   s  the  change  we  need,  Minnesota.   And  maybe  if  John  McCain  spent  some  time  in  the  schools  of  South  Carolina  or  St.  Paul,   Minnesota,  or  where  he  spoke  tonight  in  New  Orleans,  Louisiana,  he   d  understand  that  we   can   t  afford  to  leave  the  money  behind  for  No  Child  Left  Behind    that  we  owe  it  to  our  children   to  invest  in  early  childhood  education    and  recruit  an  army  of  new  teachers  and  give  them   better  pay  and  more  support    and  finally  decide  that,  in  this  global  economy,  the  chance  to   get  a  college  education  should  not  be  a  privilege  for  the  few,  but  a  birthright  of  every   American.  That   s  the  change  we  need  in  America.  That   s  why  I   m  running  for  President  of  the   United  States.   Now,  the  other  side  will  come  here  in  September  and  offer  a  very  different  set  of  policies  and   positions,  and  that  is  a  good  thing.  That  is  a  debate  I  look  forward  to.  It  is  a  debate  that  the   American  people  deserve  on  the  issues  that  will  help  determine  the  future  of  this  country  and   the  future  for  our  children.  But  what  you  don   t  deserve  is  another  election  that   s  governed  by   fear,  and  innuendo,  and  division.  What  you  won   t  hear  from  this  campaign  or  this  Party  is  the   kind  of  politics  that  uses  religion  as  a  wedge  and  patriotism  as  a  bludgeon. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Copyright  Status:  Restricted,  seek  permission.    2010   Page  4      What  you  won   t  see  from  this  campaign  or  this  Party  is  a  politics  that  sees  our  opponents  not   as  competitors  to  challenge,  but  enemies  to  polarize,  because  we  may  call  ourselves   Democrats  and  Republicans,  but  we  are  Americans  first.  We  are  always  Americans  first.   Despite  what  the  good  senator  from  Arizona  may  have  said  tonight,  I   ve  seen  people  of   differing  views  and  opinions  find  common  cause  many  times  during  my  two  decades  in  public   life,  and  I   ve  brought  many  together  myself.  I   ve  walked  arm  in  arm  with  community  leaders   on  the  south  side  of  Chicago  and  watched  tensions  fade  as  black  and  white  and  Latino  fought   together  for  good  jobs  and  good  schools.  I   ve  sat  across  the  table  from  law  enforcement   officials  and  civil  rights  advocates  to  reform  a  criminal  justice  system  that  sent  13  innocent   people  to  death  row.  I   ve  worked  with  friends  in  the  other  Party  to  provide  more  children  with   health  insurance  and  more  working  families  with  a  tax  break,  to  curb  the  spread  of  nuclear   weapons  and  ensure  that  the  American  people  know  where  their  tax  dollars  are  being  spent,   and  to  reduce  the  influence  of  lobbyists  who  have  all  too  often  set  the  agenda  in  Washington.   In  our  country,  I  have  found  that  this  cooperation  happens  not  because  we  agree  on   everything,  but  because,  behind  all  the  false  labels  and  false  divisions  and  categories  that   define  us,  beyond  all  the  petty  bickering  and  point  scoring  in  Washington,  Americans  are  a   decent,  generous,  compassionate  people,  united  by  common  challenges  and  common  hopes.   And  every  so  often,  there  are  moments  which  call  on  that  fundamental  goodness  to  make  this   country  great  again.  So  it  was  for  that  band  of  patriots  who  declared  in  a  Philadelphia  hall  the   formation  of  a  more  perfect  union,  and  for  all  those  who  gave  on  the  fields  of  Gettysburg  and   Antietam  their  last  full  measure  of  devotion  to  save  that  same  union.  So  it  was  for  the   greatest  generation  that  conquered  fear  itself,  and  liberated  a  continent  from  tyranny,  and   made  this  country  home  to  untold  opportunity  and  prosperity.  So  it  was  for  the  workers  who   stood  out  on  the  picket  lines,  the  women  who  shattered  glass  ceilings,  the  children  who   braved  a  Selma  bridge  for  freedom   s  cause.  So  it  has  been  for  every  generation  that  faced   down  the  greatest  challenges  and  the  most  improbable  odds  to  leave  their  children  a  world   that   s  better  and  kinder  and  more  just.   And  so  it  must  be  for  us.   America,  this  is  our  moment.  This  is  our  time,  our  time  to  turn  the  page  on  the  policies  of  the   past,  our  time  to  bring  new  energy  and  new  ideas  to  the  challenges  we  face,  our  time  to  offer   a  new  direction  for  this  country  that  we  love.   The  journey  will  be  difficult.  The  road  will  be  long.  I  face  this  challenge  with  profound  humility   and  knowledge  of  my  own  limitations,  but  I  also  face  it  with  limitless  faith  in  the  capacity  of   the  American  people.   Because  if  we  are  willing  to  work  for  it,  and  fight  for  it,  and  believe  in  it,  then  I  am  absolutely   certain  that,  generations  from  now,  we  will  be  able  to  look  back  and  tell  our  children  that  this   was  the  moment  when  we  began  to  provide  care  for  the  sick  and  good  jobs  to  the  jobless.   This  was  the  moment  when  the  rise  of  the  oceans  began  to  slow  and  our  planet  began  to  heal. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.

"Thank  you  to  the  citizens  of  Berlin  and  thank  you  to  the  people  of  Germany.  Let  me  thank   Chancellor  Merkel  and  Foreign  Minister  Steinmeier  for  welcoming  me  earlier  today.  Thank  you   Mayor  Wowereit,  the  Berlin  Senate,  the  police,  and  most  of  all  thanks  to  all  of  you  for  this   extraordinary  welcome.  Thank  you.   I  come  to  Berlin  as  so  many  of  my  countrymen  have  come  before    although  tonight,  I  speak   to  you  not  as  a  candidate  for  President,  but  as  a  citizen        a  proud  citizen  of  the  United  States,   and  a  fellow  citizen  of  the  world.   I  know  that  I  don   t  look  like  the  Americans  who   ve  previously  spoken  in  this  great  city.  The   journey  that  led  me  here  is  improbable.  My  mother  was  born  in  the  heartland  of  America,  but   my  father  grew  up  herding  goats  in  Kenya.  His  father        my  grandfather        was  a  cook,  a   domestic  servant  to  the  British.   At  the  height  of  the  Cold  War,  my  father  decided,  like  so  many  others  in  the  forgotten  corners   of  the  world,  that  his  yearning        his  dream        required  the  freedom  and  opportunity  promised   by  the  West.  And  so  he  wrote  letter  after  letter  to  universities  all  across  America  until   somebody,  somewhere  answered  his  prayer  for  a  better  life.   That  is  why  I  am  here.  And  you  are  here  because  you  too  know  that  yearning.  This  city,  of  all   cities,  knows  the  dream  of  freedom.  And  you  know  that  the  only  reason  we  stand  here  tonight   is  because  men  and  women  from  both  of  our  nations  came  together  to  work,  and  struggle,   and  sacrifice  for  that  better  life.

Page  1      Ours  is  a  partnership  that  truly  began  60  years  ago  this  summer,  on  the  day  when  the  first   American  plane  touched  down  at  Tempelhof.  On  that  day  much  of  this  continent  still  lay  in   ruin.  The  rubble  of  this  city  had  yet  to  be  built  into  a  wall.  The  Soviet  shadow  had  swept   across  Eastern  Europe,  while  in  the  West,  America,  Britain,  and  France  took  their  stock  of   their  losses,  and  pondered  how  the  world  might  be  remade.   This  is  where  the  two  sides  met.  And  on  the  twenty  fourth  of  June,  1948,  the  Communists   chose  to  blockade  the  western  part  of  the  city.  They  cut  off  food  and  supplies  to  more  than   two  million  Germans  in  an  effort  to  extinguish  the  last  flame  of  freedom  in  Berlin.   The  size  of  our  forces  was  no  match  for  the  larger  Soviet  Army.  And  yet  retreat  would  have   allowed  Communism  to  march  across  Europe.  Where  the  last  war  had  ended,  another  World   War  could  have  easily  begun.  And  all  that  stood  in  the  way  was  Berlin.  And  that   s  when  the   airlift  began,  when  the  largest  and  most  unlikely  rescue  in  the  history  brought  food  and  hope   to  the  people  of  this  city.   The  odds  were  stacked  against  success.  In  the  winter,  a  heavy  fog  filled  the  sky  above,  and   many  planes  were  forced  to  turn  back  without  dropping  off  the  needed  supplies.  The  streets   where  we  stand  were  filled  with  hungry  families  who  had  no  comfort  from  the  cold.   But  in  the  darkest  hours,  the  people  of  Berlin  kept  the  flame  of  hope  burning.  The  people  of   Berlin  refused  to  give  up.  And  on  one  fall  day,  hundreds  of  thousands  of  Berliners  came  here,   to  the  Tiergarten,  and  heard  the  city   s  mayor  implore  the  world  not  to  give  up  on  freedom.      There  is  only  one  possibility,     he  said.     For  us  to  stand  together  united  until  this  battle  is   won   The  people  of  Berlin  have  spoken.  We  have  done  our  duty,""  he  said,  ""and  we  will  keep   on  doing  our  duty.  People  of  the  world,  now  do  your  duty.  People  of  the  world,  look  at  Berlin.      People  of  the  world        look  at  Berlin!   Look  at  Berlin,  where  Germans  and  Americans  learned  to  work  together  and  trust  each  other   less  than  three  years  after  facing  each  other  on  the  field  of  battle.   Look  at  Berlin,  where  the  determination  of  a  people  met  the  generosity  of  the  Marshall  Plan   and  created  a  German  miracle    where  a        where  a  victory  over  tyranny  gave  rise  to  NATO,   the  greatest  alliance  ever  formed  to  defend  our  common  security.   Look  at  Berlin,  where  the  bullet  holes  in  the  buildings  and  the  somber  stones  and  pillars  near   the  Brandenburg  Gate  insist  that  we  never  forget  our  common  humanity.   People  of  the  world        look  at  Berlin,  where  a  wall  came  down,  a  continent  came  together,  and   history  proved  that  there  is  no  challenge  too  great  for  a  world  that  stands  as  one.   Sixty  years  after  the  airlift,  we  are  called  upon  again.  History  has  led  us  to  a  new  crossroad,   with  new  promise  and  new  peril. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Property  of  .       Copyright  2008.  All  rights  reserved.   Page  2      When  you,  the  German  people,  tore  down  that  wall        a  wall  that  divided  East  and  West     freedom  and  tyranny    fear  and  hope        walls  came  tumbling  down  around  the  world.  From   Kiev  to  Cape  Town,  prison  camps  were  closed,  and  the  doors  of  democracy  were  opened.   Markets  opened  too,  and  the  spread  of  information  and  technology  reduced  barriers  to   opportunity  and  prosperity.  While  the  20th  century  taught  us  that  we  share  a  common   destiny,  the  21st  century  has  revealed  a  world  more  intertwined  than  at  any  time  in  human   history.   The  fall  of  the  Berlin  Wall  brought  new  hope.  But  that  very  closeness  has  given  rise  to  new   dangers  that  cannot  be  contained  within  the  borders  of  a  country  or  by  the  distance  of  an   ocean.   Think  about  it:  The  terrorists  of  September  11th  plotted  in  Hamburg  and  trained  in  Kandahar   and  Karachi  before  killing  thousands  from  all  over  the  globe  on  American  soil.  As  we  speak,   cars  in  Boston  and  factories  in  Beijing  are  melting  the  ice  caps  in  the  Arctic,  shrinking   coastlines  in  the  Atlantic,  and  bringing  drought  to  farms  from  Kansas  to  Kenya.   Poorly  secured  nuclear  material  in  the  former  Soviet  Union,  or  secrets  from  a  scientist  in   Pakistan  could  help  build  a  bomb  that  detonates  in  Paris.  The  poppies  in  Afghanistan  come  to   Berlin  in  the  form  of  the  heroin.  The  poverty  and  violence  in  Somalia  breeds  the  terror  of   tomorrow.  The  genocide  in  Darfur  shames  the  conscience  of  us  all.   In  this  new  world,  such  dangerous  currents  have  swept  along  faster  than  our  efforts  to  contain   them.  And  that  is  why  we  cannot  afford  to  be  divided.  No  one  nation,  no  matter  how  large  or   powerful,  can  defeat  such  challenges  alone.  None  of  us  can  deny  these  threats,  or  escape   responsibility  in  meeting  them.  In  the  absence  of  Soviet  tanks  and  a  terrible  wall,  it  has   become  easy  to  forget  this  truth.  And  if  we   re  honest  with  each  other,  we  know  that   sometimes,  on  both  sides  of  the  Atlantic,  we  have  drifted  apart,  and  forgotten  our  shared   destiny.   In  Europe,  the  view  that  America  is  part  of  what  has  gone  wrong  in  our  world,  rather  than  a   force  to  help  us  make  it  right,  has  become  all  too  common.  In  America,  there  are  voices  that   deride  and  deny  the  importance  of  Europe   s  role  in  our  security  and  our  future.  Both  views   miss  the  truth:  that  Europeans  today  are  bearing  new  burdens  and  taking  more  responsibility   in  critical  parts  of  the  world    and  that  just  as  American  bases  built  in  the  last  century  still  help   to  defend  the  security  of  this  continent,  so  does  our  country  still  sacrifice  greatly  for  freedom   around  the  globe.   Yes,  there  have  been  differences  between  America  and  Europe.  No  doubt,  there  will  be   differences  in  the  future.  But  the  burdens  of  global  citizenship  continue  to  bind  us  together.  A   change  of  leadership  in  Washington  will  not  lift  this  burden.  In  this  new  century,  Americans   and  Europeans  alike  will  be  required  to  do  more        not  less.  Partnership  and  cooperation   among  nations  is  not  a  choice    it  is  the  only  way,  the  one  way,  to  protect  our  common   security  and  advance  our  common  humanity. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Property  of  .       Copyright  2008.  All  rights  reserved.   Page  3      That  is  why  the  greatest  danger  of  all  is  to  allow  new  walls  to  divide  us  from  one  another.  The   walls  between  old  allies  on  either  side  of  the  Atlantic  cannot  stand.  The  walls  between  the   countries  with  the  most  and  those  with  the  least  cannot  stand.  The  walls  between  races  and   tribes    natives  and  immigrants    Christians  and  Muslims  and  Jews  cannot  stand.  These  now  are   the  walls  we  must  tear  down.   We  know  that  these  walls  have  fallen  before.  After  centuries  of  strife,  the  people  of  Europe   have  formed  a  Union  of  promise  and  prosperity.  Here,  at  the  base  of  a  column  built  to  mark   victory  in  war,  we  meet  in  the  center  of  a  Europe  at  peace.  Not  only  have  walls  come  down  in   Berlin,  but  they've  come  down  in  Belfast,  where  Protestant  and  Catholic  found  a  way  to  live   together    in  the  Balkans,  where  our  Atlantic  alliance  ended  wars  and  brought  savage  war   criminals  to  justice    and  in  South  Africa,  where  the  struggle  of  a  courageous  people  defeated   apartheid.   So  history  reminds  us  that  walls  can  be  torn  down.  But  the  task  is  never  easy.  True   partnership  and  true  progress  requires  constant  work  and  sustained  sacrifice.  They  require   sharing  the  burdens  of  development  and  diplomacy    of  peace  and  progress.  They  require  allies   who  will  listen  to  each  other,  learn  from  each  other  and,  most  of  all,  trust  each  other.   That  is  why  America  cannot  turn  inward.  That  is  why  Europe  cannot  turn  inward.  America  has   no  better  partner  than  Europe.  Now  is  the  time  to  build  new  bridges  across  the  globe  as   strong  as  the  one  that  binds  us  across  the  Atlantic.  Now  is  the  time  to  join  together,  through   constant  cooperation  and  strong  institutions  and  shared  sacrifice  and  a  global  commitment  to   progress,  to  meet  the  challenges  of  the  21st  century.  It  was  this  spirit  that  led  airlift  planes  to   appear  in  the  sky  above  our  heads,  and  people  to  assemble  where  we  stand  today.  And  this  is   the  moment  when  our  nations        and  all  nations        must  summon  that  spirit  anew.   This  is  the  moment  when  we  must  defeat  terror  and  dry  up  the  well  of  extremism  that   supports  it.  This  threat  is  real  and  we  cannot  shrink  from  our  responsibility  to  combat  it.  If  we   could  create  NATO  to  face  down  the  Soviet  Union,  we  can  join  in  a  new  and  global  partnership   to  dismantle  the  networks  that  have  struck  in  Madrid  and  Amman    in  London  and  Bali    in   Washington  and  New  York.  If  we  could  win  a  battle  of  ideas  against  the  communists,  we  can   stand  with  the  vast  majority  of  Muslims  who  reject  the  extremism  that  leads  to  hate  instead  of   hope.   This  is  the  moment  when  we  must  renew  our  resolve  to  rout  the  terrorists  who  threaten  our   security  in  Afghanistan,  and  the  traffickers  who  sell  drugs  on  your  streets.  No  one  welcomes   war.  I  recognize  the  enormous  difficulties  in  Afghanistan.  But  my  country  and  yours  have  a   stake  in  seeing  that  NATO   s  first  mission  beyond  Europe   s  borders  is  a  success.  For  the  people   of  Afghanistan,  and  for  our  shared  security,  the  work  must  be  done.  America  can't  do  this   alone.   The  Afghan  people  need  our  troops  and  your  troops    our  support  and  your  support  to   defeat  the  Taliban  and  al  Qaeda,  to  develop  their  economy,  and  to  help  them  rebuild  their   nation.  We  have  too  much  at  stake  to  turn  back  now. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Property  of  .       Copyright  2008.  All  rights  reserved.   Page  4      This  is  the  moment  when  we  must  renew  the  goal  of  a  world  without  nuclear  weapons.   The   two  superpowers  that  faced  each  other  across  the  wall  of  this  city  came  too  close  too  often  to   destroying  all  we  have  built  and  all  that  we  love.  With  that  wall  gone,  we  need  not  stand  idly   by  and  watch  the  further  spread  of  the  deadly  atom.  It  is  time  to  secure  all  loose  nuclear   materials    to  stop  the  spread  of  nuclear  weapons    and  to  reduce  the  arsenals  from  another   era.  This  is  the  moment  to  begin  the  work  of  seeking  the  peace  of  a  world  without  nuclear   weapons.   This  is  the  moment  when  every  nation  in  Europe  must  have  the  chance  to  choose  its  own   tomorrow,  free  from  the  shadows  of  yesterday.  In  this  century,  we  need  a  strong  European   Union  that  deepens  the  security  and  prosperity  of  this  continent,  while  extending  a  hand   abroad.  In  this  century        in  this  city  of  all  cities        we  must  reject  the  Cold  War  mind  set  of   the  past,  and  resolve  to  work  with  Russia  when  we  can,  to  stand  up  for  our  values  when  we   must,  and  to  seek  a  partnership  that  extends  across  this  entire  continent.   This  is  the  moment  when  we  must  build  on  the  wealth  that  open  markets  have  created,  and   share  the  benefits  more  equitably.  Trade  has  been  a  cornerstone  of  our  growth  and  global   development.  But  we  will  not  be  able  to  sustain  this  growth  if  it  favors  the  few,  and  not  the   many.  Together  we  must  forge  trade  that  truly  rewards  the  work  that  creates  wealth,  with   meaningful  protections  for  our  people  and  our  planet.  This  is  the  moment  for  trade  that  is  free   and  fair  for  all.   This  is  the  moment  we  must  help  answer  the  call  for  a  new  dawn  in  the  Middle  East.  My   country  must  stand  with  yours  and  with  Europe  in  sending  a  direct  message  to  Iran  that  it   must  abandon  its  nuclear  ambitions.  We  must  support  the  Lebanese  who've  marched  and  bled   for  democracy,  and  the  Israelis  and  the  Palestinians  who  seek  a  secure  and  lasting  peace.  And   despite  past  differences,  this  is  the  moment  when  the  world  should  support  the  millions  of   Iraqis  who  seek  to  rebuild  their  lives,  even  as  we  pass  responsibility  to  the  Iraqi  government   and  finally  bring  this  war  to  a  close.   This  is  the  moment  when  we  must  come  together  to  save  this  planet.  Let  us  resolve  that  we   will  not  leave  our  children  to  a  world  where  the  oceans  rise  and  famine  spreads  and  terrible   storms  devastate  our  lands.  Let  us  resolve  that  all  nations        including  my  own        will  act  with   the  same  seriousness  of  purpose  as  has  your  nation,  and  reduce  the  carbon  we  send  into  our   atmosphere.  This  is  the  moment  to  give  our  children  back  their  future.  This  is  the  moment  to   stand  as  one.   And  this  is  the  moment  when  we  must  give  hope  to  those  left  behind  in  a  globalized  world.  We   must  remember  that  the  Cold  War  born  in  this  city  was  not  a  battle  for  land  or  treasure.  Sixty   years  ago,  the  planes  that  flew  over  Berlin  did  not  drop  bombs    instead  they  delivered  food,   and  coal,  and  candy  to  grateful  children.  And  in  that  show  of  solidarity,  those  pilots  won  more   than  a  military  victory.  They  won  hearts  and  minds    love  and  loyalty  and  trust        not  just  from   the  people  in  this  city,  but  from  all  those  who  heard  the  story  of  what  they  did  here. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Property  of  .       Copyright  2008.  All  rights  reserved.   Page  5      Now  the  world  will  watch  and  remember  what  we  do  here  with  this  moment.  Will  we  extend   our  hand  to  the  people  in  the  forgotten  corners  of  this  world  who  yearn  for  lives  marked  by   dignity  and  opportunity,  by  security  and  justice?  Will  we  lift  the  child  in  Bangladesh  from   poverty,  and  shelter  the  refugee  in  Chad,  and  banish  the  scourge  of  AIDS  in  our  time?   Will  we  stand  for  the  human  rights  of  the  dissident  in  Burma,  the  blogger  in  Iran,  or  the  voter   in  Zimbabwe?  Will  we  give  meaning  to  the  words     never  again     in  Darfur?   Will  we  acknowledge  that  there  is  no  more  powerful  example  than  the  one  each  of  our  nations   projects  to  the  world?  Will  we  reject  torture  and  stand  for  the  rule  of  law?  Will  we  welcome   immigrants  from  different  lands,  and  shun  discrimination  against  those  who  don   t  look  like  us   or  worship  like  we  do,  and  keep  the  promise  of  equality  and  opportunity  for  all  of  our  people?   People  of  Berlin        people  of  the  world        this  is  our  moment.  This  is  our  time.   I  know  my  country  has  not  perfected  itself.  At  times,  we   ve  struggled  to  keep  the  promise  of   liberty  and  equality  for  all  of  our  people.  We   ve  made  our  share  of  mistakes,  and  there  are   times  when  our  actions  around  the  world  have  not  lived  up  to  our  best  intentions.   But  I  also  know  how  much  I  love  America.  I  know  that  for  more  than  two  centuries,  we  have   strived        at  great  cost  and  great  sacrifice        to  form  a  more  perfect  union    to  seek,  with  other   nations,  a  more  hopeful  world.  Our  allegiance  has  never  been  to  any  particular  tribe  or   kingdom        indeed,  every  language  is  spoken  in  our  country    every  culture  has  left  its  imprint   on  ours    every  point  of  view  is  expressed  in  our  public  squares.  What  has  always  united  us,   what  has  always  driven  our  people,  what  drew  my  father  to  America   s  shores  is  a  set  of  ideals   that  speak  to  aspirations  shared  by  all  people:  that  we  can  live  free  from  fear  and  free  from   want    that  we  can  speak  our  minds  and  assemble  with  whomever  we  choose  and  worship  as   we  please.   These  are  the  aspirations  that  join  the  fates  of  all  nations  in  this  city.  These  aspirations  are   bigger  than  anything  that  drives  us  apart.  It  is  because  of  these  aspirations  that  the  airlift   began.  It  is  because  of  these  aspirations  that  all  free  people        everywhere        became  citizens   of  Berlin.  It  is  in  pursuit  of  these  aspirations  that  a  new  generation        our  generation        must   make  our  mark  on  the  world.   People  of  Berlin,  and  people  of  the  world,  the  scale  of  our  challenge  is  great.  The  road  ahead   will  be  long.  But  I  come  before  you  to  say  that  we  are  heirs  to  a  struggle  for  freedom.  We  are   a  people  of  improbable  hope.  With  an  eye  toward  the  future,  with  resolve  in  our  heart,  let  us   remember  this  history,  and  answer  our  destiny,  and  remake  the  world  once  again.   Thank  you,  Berlin.  God  bless  you.  Thank  you.  Thank  you. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Property  of  .       Copyright  2008.  All  rights  reserved.   Page  6  ",obama
"Thank you very much, Madam President. And thank you to the distinguished Senator fromConnecticut not only for yielding time, but also for the extraordinarily hard work that he's putin over the last several days and, in fact, over a -- a week. And I want to thank hiscounterparts on the other side, including Senator Gregg, for their hard work. Now, the fact that we're even here voting on a plan to rescue our economy from the greedand irresponsibility of Wall Street and some in Washington is an outrage. It's an outrage toevery American who works hard, pays their taxes, is doing their best every day to make abetter life for themselves and their families. And understandably, people are frustrated andthey're angry that Wall Street's mistakes have put their tax dollars at risk. And they shouldbe. I'm frustrated and angry, too. But while there's plenty of blame to go around -- and many in Washington and Wall Streetwho deserve it, all of us -- all of us have a responsibility to solve this crisis, because it affectsthe financial well-being of every single American. There will be time to punish those who setthis fire, but now is not the time to argue about how it got set, or did the neighbor sleep in hisbed, or leave the stove on. Right now we want to put out that fire; and now's the time for usto come together and do that. When the House of Representatives failed to act on Monday, we saw the single largest declinein the stock market in two decades. Over one trillion dollars of wealth was lost by the time themarkets closed. And it wasn't just the wealth of a few CEOs or Wall Street executives. The401(k)s and retirement accounts of millions became smaller. The state pension funds ofteachers and government employees lost billions upon billions of dollars. Hard-workingAmericans who invested their nest egg to watch it grow saw it diminish and in some casesdisappear. And while that decline was devastating, the consequences of the credit crisis that caused itwill be even worse if we do not act now. We're in a very dangerous situation, where financialinstitutions across this country are afraid to lend money. And if all that meant was the failureof a few banks in New York, that would be one thing. But that's not what it means. What itmeans is, if we don't act, it will be harder for Americans to get a mortgage for their home orloans they need to buy a car or send their children to college. What it means is that businesses won't be able to get the loans they need to open a newfactory or make payroll for their workers. And if they can't make payroll on Friday, thenworkers are laid off on Monday. And if workers are laid off on Monday, then they can't paytheir bills or pay back their loans to somebody else. And it will go on and on and on, ripplingthrough the entire economy. And potentially we could see thousands of businesses close,millions of jobs could be lost, and a long and painful recession could follow. In other words,this is not just a Wall Street crisis; it's an American crisis. And it's the American economy thatneeds this rescue plan. I understand completely why people would be skeptical when this President asks for a blankcheck to solve this problem. I was, too, as was Senator Dodd and a whole bunch of us here.And that's why, over a week ago, I demanded that this plan include some specific proposals toprotect taxpayers, protections that the Administration eventually agreed to, and, thanks to thehard work of Senator Dodd and Republican counterparts like Senator Gregg, we here in theSenate have agreed to, and now hopefully the House will agree to, as well. Let me just go over those principles: Number one, I said we needed an independent board to provide oversight andaccountability for how and where this money is spent at every step of the way. Number two, I said that we cannot help banks on Wall Street without helping themillions of innocent homeowners who are struggling to stay in their homes. Theydeserve a plan, too. Number three, I said that I would not allow this plan to become a welfare program forWall Street executives, whose greed and irresponsibility got us into this mess. And, finally, I said that, if American taxpayers are financing this solution, then theyhave to be treated like investors. They should get every penny of their tax dollars backonce the economy recovers. Now, this last part is important, because it's been the most misunderstood and poorlycommunicated part of this plan. This is not a plan to just hand over 700 billion dollars oftaxpayer money to a few banks. If this is managed correctly -- and that's an important ""if"" --we will hopefully get most or all of our money back and possibly even turn a profit on thegovernment's intervention, every penny of which will go directly back to the American people.And if we fall short, we will levy a fee on financial institutions so that they can repay for thelosses that they caused. Now, let me -- let's acknowledge, even with all these taxpayer protections, this plan is notperfect. Democrats and Republicans in Congress have legitimate concerns about it. Some ofmy closest colleagues, people I have the greatest respect for, still have problems with it andmay choose to vote against this bill, and I think that we can respectfully disagree. Iunderstand their frustrations. I also know that many -- many Americans share their concerns. But it's clear that, from myperspective, this is what we need to do right now to prevent the possibility of a crisis turninginto a catastrophe. It is conceivable -- it's possible that if we did nothing everything wouldturn out okay. It's -- There -- There's a possibility that that's true. And there's no doubt thatthere may be other plans out there that, had we had two or three or six months to develop,might be even more refined and might serve our purposes better. But we don't have that kind of time. And we can't afford to take a risk that the economy ofthe United States of America and, as a consequence, the worldwide economy could beplunged into a very, very deep hole. So to Democrats and Republicans who've opposed thisplan, I say: Step up to the plate. Let's do what's right for the country at this time, becausethe time to act is now. I know many Americans are wondering what happens next. And passing this bill can't be theend of our work to strengthen our economy; it must be the beginning. Because one thing I --I think all of us who may end up supporting this bill understand is that, even if we get this inplace, we could still have enormous problems and probably will have big problems in theeconomy over the next several months and potentially longer; because the fact is, is that wehave seen some mismanagement of the fundamentals of the economy for a very long time,and we are not going to dig ourselves out of that hole immediately. So this is not the end. This is the beginning. As soon as we pass this rescue plan, we need tomove aggressively with the same sense of urgency to rescue families on Main Street who arestruggling to pay their bills and keep their jobs. They've been in crisis a lot longer than WallStreet has. I've said it before and I say it again: We need to pass an economic stimulus package that willhelp ordinary Americans cope with rising food and gas prices, that can save one million jobsrebuilding our schools, and roads, and our infrastructure, and help states and cities avoidbudget cuts and tax increase[s], a -- a plan that would extend expiring unemploymentbenefits for those Americans who've lost their jobs and cannot find new ones. That's the rightthing to do at a time when consumer confidence is down and we are in great danger ofslipping into a big recession. We also must do more in this rescue package in order to help homeowners stay in theirhomes. I will continue to advocate bankruptcy reforms. I know my colleague from Illinois,Dick Durbin, has been a strong champion of this, as have many. It is the right thing to do tochange our bankruptcy laws so that people have a better chance of staying in their homes andwe're not seeing communities devastated all across the country. And we should encourageTreasury to study the option of buying individual mortgages, like we did successfully in the1930s. And finally, while we all hope that this rescue package succeeds, we should be prepared totake more vigorous actions in the months ahead to rebuild capital, if it's necessary. Now, just as families are planning for their future in tough times, Washington's going to haveto do the same. Runaway spending and record deficits are not how families run their budgets.It can't be how Washington handles people's tax dollars. So we're going to have to return tothe fiscal responsibility we had in the 1990s. And the next White House and the next Congressis going to have to work together to make sure that we go through our budget, we get rid ofprograms that don't work, that we make the ones that do work better and cost less. With lessmoney flowing into the Treasury, some useful programs or policies might need to be delayed.And some might be -- need to be stretched out over a longer period of time. But there are certain investments in our future that we cannot delay, precisely because oureconomy is in turmoil. Mr. President, I've exceeded the time a little bit. I would like unanimous consent for a couplemore minutes. [Cross talk from the Floor] Senate President: Is there objection? Seeing no objection -- Senator Obama: Thank you. There are certain investments in our future that we can't delay precisely be -- because theeconomy's in turmoil. We can't wait to help Americans keep up with rising costs and shrinkingpaychecks, and we're going to do that by making sure that we are giving our workers amiddle-class tax cut. We can't wait to relieve the burden of crushing health care costs. We can't wait to createmillions of new jobs by rebuilding our roads and our bridges, and investing in broadband linesin rural communities, and fixing our electricity grid so we can get renewable energy topopulation centers that need them. And we need to develop an energy policy that prevents usfrom sending 700 billion dollars a year to tyrants and dictators for their oil. We can't wait toeducate the next generation of Americans with the skills and knowledge they need to competewith any workers anywhere in the world. These are the priorities we cannot delay. Now, let me just close by saying this: I do not think this is going to be easy. It's not going tocome without costs. We are all going to need to sacrifice. We're all going to need to pull ourweight, because now, more than ever, we are all in this together. That's part of what thiscrisis has taught us -- that in the end of the day, there's no real separation between WallStreet and Main Street. There's only the road we're traveling on as Americans. And we willrise or fall on that journey as one nation and as one people. I know that many Americans are feeling anxiety right now about their jobs, about theirhomes, about their life savings. But I also know this, that we can steer ourselves out of thiscrisis. We are -- always have. During the great financial crisis of the last century, in his firstfireside chat, FDR told his fellow Americans that, There is an element in the re-adjustment of our financial system more important thancurrency, more important than gold, and that is the confidence of the peoplethemselves. Confidence and courage are the essentials of success in carrying out ourplan. Let us unite in banishing fear. Together we cannot fail. We cannot fail, not now, not tomorrow,not next year. This is a nation that's faced down war and depression, great challenges and great threats. Andat each and every moment, we have risen to meet up these challenges, not as Democrats, notas Republicans, but as Americans, with resolve and with confidence, with that fundamentalbelief that, here in America, our destiny is not written for us, it's written by us. And that's whowe are. And that's the country I know we can be right now. I want to thank again the extraordinary leadership of Chairman Dodd and Banking -- theBanking Committee, as well as Chairman Baucus and Majority Leader Reid. They have workedtirelessly. I want to thank the leadership in the House of Representatives. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation, understanding thatthis will not solve all our problems. It is a necessary but not sufficient step to make sure thatthis economy once again works on behalf of all Americans in their pursuit of the Americandream. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.",obama
"Hello,  Chicago.   If  there  is  anyone  out  there  who  still  doubts  that  America  is  a  place  where  all  things  are   possible    who  still  wonders  if  the  dream  of  our  founders  is  alive  in  our  time    who  still   questions  the  power  of  our  democracy,  tonight  is  your  answer.   It's  the  answer  told  by  lines  that  stretched  around  schools  and  churches  in  numbers  this   nation  has  never  seen    by  people  who  waited  three  hours  and  four  hours,  many  for  the  very   first  time  in  their  lives,  because  they  believed  that  this  time  must  be  different    that  their   voices  could  be  that  difference.   It's  the  answer  spoken  by  young  and  old,  rich  and  poor,  Democrat  and  Republican,  black,   white,  Hispanic,  Asian,  Native  American,  gay,  straight,  disabled  and  not  disabled        Americans   who  sent  a  message  to  the  world  that  we  have  never  been  just  a  collection  of  individuals  or  a   collection  of  Red  States  and  Blue  States:  we  are,  and  always  will  be,  the  United  States  of   America!   It's  the  answer  that  led  those  who  have  been  told  for  so  long  by  so  many  to  be  cynical,  and   fearful,  and  doubtful  about  what  we  can  achieve  to  put  their  hands  on  the  arc  of  history  and   bend  it  once  more  toward  the  hope  of  a  better  day.   It's  been  a  long  time  coming,  but  tonight,  because  of  what  we  did  on  this  day,  in  this  election,   at  this  defining  moment,  change  has  come  to  America. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Property  of  .       Copyright  2008.  All  rights  reserved.   Page  1      A  little  bit  earlier  this  evening,  I  received  an  extraordinarily  gracious  call  from  Senator  McCain.   Senator  McCain  fought  long  and  hard  in  this  campaign,  and  he's  fought  even  longer  and   harder  for  the  country  that  he  loves.  He  has  endured  sacrifices  for  America  that  most  of  us   cannot  begin  to  imagine.  We  are  better  off  for  the  service  rendered  by  this  brave  and  selfless   leader.  I  congratulate  him    I  congratulate  Governor  Palin  for  all  that  they've  achieved,  and  I   look  forward  to  working  with  them  to  renew  this  nation's  promise  in  the  months  ahead.   I  want  to  thank  my  partner  in  this  journey,  a  man  who  campaigned  from  his  heart  and  spoke   for  the  men  and  women  he  grew  up  with  on  the  streets  of  Scranton  and  rode  with  on  the  train   home  to  Delaware,  the  Vice  President  elect  of  the  United  States,  Joe  Biden.   And  I  would  not  be  standing  here  tonight  without  the  unyielding  support  of  my  best  friend  for   the  last  16  years,  the  rock  of  our  family,  the  love  of  my  life,  the  nation's  next  First  Lady:   Michelle  Obama.  Sasha  and  Malia,  I  love  you  both  more  than  you  can  imagine,  and  you  have   earned  the  new  puppy  that's  coming  with  us  to  the  White  House.  And  while  she's  no  longer   with  us,  I  know  my  grandmother's  watching,  along  with  the  family  that  made  me  who  I  am.  I   miss  them  tonight,  and  I  know  that  my  debt  to  them  is  beyond  measure.  To  my  sister  Maya,   my  sister  Alma,  all  my  other  brothers  and  sisters        thank  you  so  much  for  the  support  that   you've  given  me.  I  am  grateful  to  them.   And  to  my  campaign  manager,  David  Plouffe        the  unsung  hero  of  this  campaign,  who  built   the  best  political  campaign,  I  think,  in  the  history  of  the  United  States  of  America.  To  my  chief   strategist  David  Axelrod        who's  been  a  partner  with  me  every  step  of  the  way.  To  the  best   campaign  team  ever  assembled  in  the  history  of  politics        you  made  this  happen,  and  I  am   forever  grateful  for  what  you've  sacrificed  to  get  it  done.   But  above  all,  I  will  never  forget  who  this  victory  truly  belongs  to.  It  belongs  to  you.  It   belongs  to  you.  I  was  never  the  likeliest  candidate  for  this  office.  We  didn't  start  with  much   money  or  many  endorsements.  Our  campaign  was  not  hatched  in  the  halls  of  Washington.  It   began  in  the  backyards  of  Des  Moines  and  the  living  rooms  of  Concord  and  the  front  porches   of  Charleston.  It  was  built  by  working  men  and  women  who  dug  into  what  little  savings  they   had  to  give  5  dollars  and  10  dollars  and  20  dollars  to  the  cause.  It  grew  strength  from  the   young  people  who  rejected  the  myth  of  their  generation's  apathy,  who  left  their  homes  and   their  families  for  jobs  that  offered  little  pay  and  less  sleep.  It  drew  strength  from  the  not  so     young  people  who  braved  the  bitter  cold  and  scorching  heat  to  knock  on  doors  of  perfect   strangers,  and  from  the  millions  of  Americans  who  volunteered  and  organized  and  proved  that   more  than  two  centuries  later  a  government  of  the  people,  by  the  people,  and  for  the  people   has  not  perished  from  the  Earth.  This  is  your  victory.   And  I  know  you  didn't  do  this  just  to  win  an  election.  And  I  know  you  didn't  do  it  for  me.  You   did  it  because  you  understand  the  enormity  of  the  task  that  lies  ahead.  For  even  as  we   celebrate  tonight,  we  know  the  challenges  that  tomorrow  will  bring  are  the  greatest  of  our   lifetime:  two  wars,  a  planet  in  peril,  the  worst  financial  crisis  in  a  century.  Even  as  we  stand   here  tonight,  we  know  there  are  brave  Americans  waking  up  in  the  deserts  of  Iraq  and  the   mountains  of  Afghanistan  to  risk  their  lives  for  us.  There  are  mothers  and  fathers  who  will  lie   awake  after  the  children  fall  asleep  and  wonder  how  they'll  make  the  mortgage  or  pay  their Transcription  by  Michael  E.

There's  new  energy  to   harness,  new  jobs  to  be  created,  new  schools  to  build,  and  threats  to  meet,  alliances  to  repair.   The  road  ahead  will  be  long.  Our  climb  will  be  steep.  We  may  not  get  there  in  one  year  or   even  in  one  term.  But,  America,  I  have  never  been  more  hopeful  than  I  am  tonight  that  we   will  get  there.  I  promise  you,  we  as  a  people  will  get  there.   There  will  be  setbacks  and  false  starts.  There  are  many  who  won't  agree  with  every  decision   or  policy  I  make  as  President.  And  we  know  the  government  can't  solve  every  problem.  But  I   will  always  be  honest  with  you  about  the  challenges  we  face.  I  will  listen  to  you,  especially   when  we  disagree.  And,  above  all,  I  will  ask  you  to  join  in  the  work  of  remaking  this  nation,   the  only  way  it's  been  done  in  America  for  221  years        block  by  block,  brick  by  brick,   calloused  hand  by  calloused  hand.  What  began  21  months  ago  in  the  depths  of  winter  cannot   end  on  this  autumn  night.   This  victory  alone  is  not  the  change  we  seek.  It  is  only  the  chance  for  us  to  make  that  change.   And  that  cannot  happen  if  we  go  back  to  the  way  things  were.  It  can't  happen  without  you,   without  a  new  spirit  of  service,  a  new  spirit  of  sacrifice.  So  let  us  summon  a  new  spirit  of   patriotism,  of  responsibility,  where  each  of  us  resolves  to  pitch  in  and  work  harder  and  look   after  not  only  ourselves  but  each  other.  Let  us  remember  that,  if  this  financial  crisis  taught  us   anything,  it's  that  we  cannot  have  a  thriving  Wall  Street  while  Main  Street  suffers.  In  this   country,  we  rise  or  fall  as  one  nation,  as  one  people.  Let's  resist  the  temptation  to  fall  back  on   the  same  partisanship  and  pettiness  and  immaturity  that  has  poisoned  our  politics  for  so  long.   Let's  remember  that  it  was  a  man  from  this  state  who  first  carried  the  banner  of  the   Republican  Party  to  the  White  House,  a  Party  founded  on  the  values  of  self  reliance  and   individual  liberty  and  national  unity.  Those  are  values  that  we  all  share.  And  while  the   Democratic  Party  has  won  a  great  victory  tonight,  we  do  so  with  a  measure  of  humility  and   determination  to  heal  the  divides  that  have  held  back  our  progress.  As  Lincoln  said  to  a  nation   far  more  divided  than  ours:  ""We  are  not  enemies  but  friends....""  ""Though  passion  may  have   strained,  it  must  not  break  our  bonds  of  affection.""     And  to  those  Americans  who  whose  support  I  have  yet  to  earn,  I  may  not  have  won  your  vote   tonight,  but  I  hear  your  voices.  I  need  your  help.  And  I  will  be  your  President,  too.   And  to  all  those  watching  tonight  from  beyond  our  shores,  from  parliaments  and  palaces,  to   those  who  are  huddled  around  radios  in  the  forgotten  corners  of  the  world,  our  stories  are   singular,  but  our  destiny  is  shared,  and  a  new  dawn  of  American  leadership  is  at  hand.   To  those  who  would  tear  the  world  down:  We  will  defeat  you.  To  those  who  seek  peace  and   security:  We  support  you.  And  to  all  those  who  have  wondered  if  America's  beacon  still  burns   as  bright:  Tonight  we've  proved  once  more  that  the  true  strength  of  our  nation  comes  not   from  the  might  of  our  arms  or  the  scale  of  our  wealth,  but  from  the  enduring  power  of  our   ideals:  democracy,  liberty,  opportunity,  and  unyielding  hope.

Our  union  can  be  perfected.  What   we've  already  achieved  gives  us  hope  for  what  we  can  and  must  achieve  tomorrow.   This  election  had  many  firsts  and  many  stories  that  will  be  told  for  generations.  But  one  that's   on  my  mind  tonight's  about  a  woman  who  cast  her  ballot  in  Atlanta.  She's  a  lot  like  the   millions  of  others  who  stood  in  line  to  make  their  voice  heard  in  this  election  except  for  one   thing:  Ann  Nixon  Cooper  is  106  years  old.   cars  on  the  road  or  planes  in  the  sky    when  someone  like  her  couldn't  vote  for  two  reasons:   because  she  was  a  woman  and  because  of  the  color  of  her  skin.   She  was  born  just  a  generation  past  slavery    a  time  when  there  were  no   And  tonight,  I  think  about  all  that  she's  seen  throughout  her  century  in  America        the   heartache  and  the  hope    the  struggle  and  the  progress    the  times  we  were  told  that  we  can't,   and  the  people  who  pressed  on  with  that  American  creed:  Yes  we  can.   At  a  time  when  women's  voices  were  silenced  and  their  hopes  dismissed,  she  lived  to  see   them  stand  up  and  speak  out  and  reach  for  the  ballot:  Yes  we  can.   When  there  was  despair  in  the  dust  bowl  and  depression  across  the  land,  she  saw  a  nation   conquer  fear  itself  with  a  New  Deal,  new  jobs,  a  new  sense  of  common  purpose:  Yes  we  can.   When  the  bombs  fell  on  our  harbor  and  tyranny  threatened  the  world,  she  was  there  to   witness  a  generation  rise  to  greatness  and  a  democracy  was  saved:  Yes  we  can.   She  was  there  for  the  buses  in  Montgomery,  the  hoses  in  Birmingham,  a  bridge  in  Selma,  and   a  preacher  from  Atlanta  who  told  a  people  that  ""we  shall  overcome"":  Yes  we  can.   A  man  touched  down  on  the  moon,  a  wall  came  down  in  Berlin,  a  world  was  connected  by  our   own  science  and  imagination.   And  this  year,  in  this  election,  she  touched  her  finger  to  a  screen,  and  cast  her  vote,  because   after  106  years  in  America,  through  the  best  of  times  and  the  darkest  of  hours,  she  knows   how  America  can  change:  Yes  we  can.   America,  we  have  come  so  far.  We  have  seen  so  much.  But  there  is  so  much  more  to  do.  So   tonight,  let  us  ask  ourselves        if  our  children  should  live  to  see  the  next  century    if  my   daughters  should  be  so  lucky  to  live  as  long  as  Ann  Nixon  Cooper,  what  change  will  they  see?   What  progress  will  we  have  made? Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Property  of  .       Copyright  2008.  All  rights  reserved.   Page  4      This  is  our  chance  to  answer  that  call.  This  is  our  moment.  This  is  our  time,  to  put  our  people   back  to  work  and  open  doors  of  opportunity  for  our  kids    to  restore  prosperity  and  promote   the  cause  of  peace    to  reclaim  the  American  dream  and  reaffirm  that  fundamental  truth,  that,   out  of  many,  we  are  one      that  while  we  breathe,  we  hope.  And  where  we  are  met  with   cynicism  and  doubt  and  those  who  tell  us  that  we  can't,  we  will  respond  with  that  timeless   creed  that  sums  up  the  spirit  of  a  people:  Yes,  we  can.

"This  morning  we  woke  up  to  more  sobering  news  about  the  state  of  our  economy.  The   240,000  jobs  lost  in  October  marks  the  10th  consecutive  month  that  our  economy  has  shed   jobs.  In  total,  we've  lost  nearly  1.2  million  jobs  this  year,  and  more  than  10  million  Americans   are  now  unemployed.  Tens  of  millions  of  families  are  struggling  to  figure  out  how  to  pay  the   bills  and  stay  in  their  homes.  Their  stories  are  an  urgent  reminder  that  we  are  facing  the   greatest  economic  challenge  of  our  lifetime,  and  we're  going  to  have  to  act  swiftly  to  resolve   it. Now,  the  United  States  has  only  one  government  and  one  President  at  a  time,  and  until   January  20th  of  next  year,  that  government  is  the  current  Administration.  I've  spoken  to   President  Bush.  I  appreciate  his  commitment  to  ensuring  that  his  economic  policy  team  keeps   us  fully  informed  as  developments  unfold.  And  I'm  also  thankful  for  his  invitation  to  the  White   House.   Immediately  after  I  become  President,  I'm  going  to  confront  this  economic  crisis  head  on  by   taking  all  necessary  steps  to  ease  the  credit  crisis,  help  hardworking  families,  and  restore   growth  and  prosperity.  This  morning  I  met  with  members  of  my  Transition  Economic  Advisory   Board,  who  are  standing  behind  me,  alongside  my  Vice  President  elect,  Joe  Biden.  They  will   help  to  guide  the  work  of  my  transition  team,  working  with  Rahm  Emanuel,  my  Chief  of  Staff,   in  developing  a  strong  set  of  policies  to  respond  to  this  crisis.   We  discussed  in  the  earlier  meeting  several  of  the  most  immediate  challenges  facing  our   economy  and  key  priorities  on  which  to  focus  on  in  the  days  and  weeks  ahead.

Page  1      First  of  all,  we  need  a  rescue  plan  for  the  middle  class  that  invests  in  immediate  efforts  to   create  jobs  and  provide  relief  to  families  that  are  watching  their  paychecks  shrink  and  their   life  savings  disappear.  A  particularly  urgent  priority  is  a  further  extension  of        of   unemployment  insurance  benefits  for  workers  who  cannot  find  work  in  the  increasingly  weak   economy.  A  fiscal  stimulus  plan  that  will  jump  start  economic  growth  is  long  overdue.  I've   talked  about  it  throughout  this        the  last  few  months  of  the  campaign.  We  should  get  it  done.   Second,  we  have  to  address  the  spreading  impact  of  the  financial  crisis  on  the  other  sectors  of   our  economy        small  businesses  that  are  struggling  to  meet  their  payrolls  and  finance  their   holiday  inventories,  and  state  and  municipal  governments  facing  devastating  budget  cuts  and   tax  increases.  We  must  also  remember  that  the  financial  crisis  is  increasingly  global  and   requires  a  global  response.   The  news  coming  out  of  the  auto  industry  this  week  reminds  us  of  the  hardship  it  faces         hardship  that  goes  far  beyond  individual  auto  companies  to  the  countless  suppliers,  small   businesses,  and  communities  throughout  our  nation  who  depend  on  a  vibrant  American  auto   industry.  The  auto  industry  is  the  backbone  of  American  manufacturing  and  a  critical  part  of   our  attempt  to  reduce  our  dependence  on  foreign  oil.   I  would  like  to  see  the  Administration  do  everything  it  can  to  accelerate  the  retooling   assistance  that  Congress  has  already  enacted.  In  addition,  I  have  made  it  a  high  priority  for   my  transition  team  to  work  on  additional  policy  options  to  help  the  auto  industry  adjust,   weather  the  financial  crisis,  and  succeed  in  producing  fuel  efficient  cars  here  in  the  United   States  of  America.  And  I  was  glad  to  be  joined  today  by  Governor  Jennifer  Granholm,  who   obviously  has  great  knowledge  and  great  interest  on  this  issue.  I've  asked  my  team  to  explore   what  we  can  do  under  current  law  and  whether  additional  legislation  will  be  needed  for  this   purpose.   Third,  we  will  review  the  implementation  of  this  Administration's  financial  program  to  ensure   that  the  government's  efforts  are  achieving  their  central  goal  of  stabilizing  financial  markets   while  protecting  taxpayers,  helping  homeowners,  and  not  unduly  rewarding  the  management   of  financial  firms  that  are  receiving  government  assistance.  It  is  absolutely  critical  that  the   Treasury  work  closely  with  the  FDIC,  HUD,  and  other  government  agencies  to  use  the   substantial  authority  that  they  already  have  to  help  families  avoid  foreclosure  and  stay  in  their   homes.   Finally,  as  we  monitor  and  address  these  immediate  economic  challenges,  we  will  be  moving   forward  in  laying  out  a  set  of  policies  that  will  grow  our  middle  class  and  strengthen  our   economy  in  the  long  term.  We  cannot  afford  to  wait  on  moving  forward  on  the  key  priorities   that  I  identified  during  the  campaign,  including  clean  energy,  health  care,  education,  and  tax   relief  for  middle  class  families.  My  transition  team  will  be  working  on  each  of  these  priorities  in   the  weeks  ahead,  and  I  intend  to  reconvene  this  advisory  board  to  discuss  the  best  ideas  for   responding  to  these  immediate  problems.

Page  2      Let  me  close  by  saying  this:  I  do  not  underestimate  the  enormity  of  the  task  that  lies  ahead.   We  have  taken  some  major  action  to  date,  and  we  will  need  further  action  during  this   transition  and  subsequent  months.  Some  of  the  choices  that  we  make  are  going  to  be  difficult.   And  I  have  said  before  and  I  will  repeat  again:  It  is  not  going  to  be  quick  and  it  is  not  going  to   be  easy  for  us  to  dig  ourselves  out  of  the  hole  that  we  are  in,  but  America  is  a  strong  and   resilient  country.  And  I  know  we  will  succeed  if  we  put  aside  partisanship  and  politics  and   work  together  as  one  nation.  That's  what  I  intend  to  do. Transcription  by  Michael  E.

"Senator  Obama:  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  President    Ladies  and  Gentlemen  of  the  Senate:   I  have  to  say  that  I  didn't  anticipate  speaking  today,  but  the  importance,  I  think,  of  this  issue   is  one  in  which  I  feel  it's  important  for  me  to  address  this  body.   You  know,  during  the  election  I  had  the  occasion  of  meeting  a  woman  who  had  supported  me   in  my  campaign.  And  she  decided  to  come  to  shake  my  hand  and  take  a  photograph.  A   wonderful  woman,  she  wasn't  asking  for  anything,  and  I  was  very  grateful  that  she  took  time   to  come  by.  It  was  a[n]  unexceptional  moment  except  for  the  fact  that  she  was  born  in  1894.   And  her  name  was  Marguerite  Lewis,  an  African  American  woman  who  had  been  born  in   Louisiana,  born  in  the  shadow  of  slavery,  born  at  a  time  when  lynchings  were  commonplace,   born  at  a  time  when  African  Americans  and  women  could  not  vote.   And  yet,  over  the  course  of  decades  she  had  participated  in  broadening  our  democracy  and   ensuring  that,  in  fact,  at  some  point,  if  not  herself,  then  her  children  and  her  grandchildren   and  her  great  grandchildren  would  be  in  a  position  in  which  they  could,  too,  call  themselves   citizens  of  the  United  States  and  make  certain  that  this  Government  works  not  just  on  behalf   of  the  mighty  and  the  powerful  but  also  on  behalf  of  people  like  her. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.  Property  of     Copyright    2010.  All  rights  reserved.   Page  1      And  so  the  fact  that  she  voted  and  that  her  vote  was  counted  in  this  election  was  of  supreme   importance  to  her  and  it  is  the  memory  of  talking  to  her  and  shaking  her  hand  that  causes  me   to  rise  on  this  occasion.   I  am  absolutely  convinced  that  the  President  of  the  United  States,  George  Bush,  won  this   election.  I  also  believe  that  he  got  more  votes  in  Ohio.  I  think,  as  has  already  been  said  by   some  of  the  speakers  in  this  body,  this  is  not  an  issue  in  which  we  are  challenging  the   outcome  of  the  election.  And  I  think  it's  important  for  us  to  separate  out  the  issue  of  the   election  outcome  with  the  election  process.   I  was  not  in  this  body  four  years  ago,  but  what  I  observed  as  a  voter,  as  a  citizen  of  Illinois   four  years  ago,  were  troubling  evidence  of  the  fact  that  not  every  vote  was  being  counted.   And  I  think  that  it  is  unfortunate  four  years  later  that  we  continue  to  see  circumstances  in   which  people  who  believe  that  they  have  the  right  to  vote        who  show  up  at  the  polls        still   continue  to  confront  the  sort  of  problems  that  have  been  documented  as  taking  place,  not  just   in  Ohio,  but  [in]  places  all  across  the  country.   I  would  strongly  urge  that  this  Chamber,  as  well  as  the  House  of  Representatives,  take  it  upon   itself  once  and  for  all  to  reform  this  system.  There  is  no  reason,  at  a  time  when  we  have   enormous  battles  taking  place  ideologically  all  across  the  globe,  at  a  time  when  we're  try  to   make  certain  that  we  encourage  democracy  in  Iraq  and  Afghanistan  and  other  places   throughout  the  world,  that  we  have  the  legitimacy  of  our  elections  challenged,  rightly  or   wrongly,  by  people  who  are  not  certain  as  to  whether  our  processes  are  fair  and  just.  This  is   something  that  we  can  fix.  We  have  experts  on  both  sides  of  the  aisle  who  know  how  to  fix  it.   What  we've  lacked  is  the  political  will.   I  would  strongly  urge  that,  in  a  circumstance  in  which  too  many  voters  have  stood  in  long   lines  for  hours,  in  which  too  many  voters  have  cast  votes  on  machines  that  jam  or  malfunction   or  suck  the  votes  without  a  trace,  in  which  too  many  voters  try  to  register  to  vote  only  to   discover  that  their  names  don't  appear  on  the  roles,  or  that  partisan  political  interests  and   those  that  serve  them  have  worked  hard  to  throw  up  every  barrier  to  recognize  them  as   lawful,  in  which  too  many  voters  will  know  that  there  are  different  elections  for  different  parts   of  the  country  and  that  these  differences  turn  shamefully  on  differences  of  wealth  or  of  race,   in  which  too  many  voters  have  to  contend  with  state  officials,  servants  of  the  public,  who  put   partisan  or  personal  political  interests  ahead  of  the  public  in  administering  our  elections        in   such  circumstances,  we  have  an  obligation  to  fix  the  problem.   And  I  have  to  add  that  this  is  not  a  problem  unique  to  this  election,  and  it  is  not  a  partisan   problem.  Keep  in  mind,  I  come  from  Cook  County,  from  Chicago,  in  which  there  is  a  long   record  of  these  kinds  of  problems  taking  place  and  disadvantaging  Republicans  as  well  as   Democrats.  So  I  would  ask  that  all  of  us  rise  up  and  use  this  occasion  to  amend  this  problem.   Thank  you. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.  Property  of     Copyright    2010.

"Let  me  begin  by  thanking  the  bipartisan  group  of  U.S.  Governors  who  convened  this  meeting.   Few  challenges  facing  America        and  the  world        are  more  urgent  than  combating  climate   change.  The  science  is  beyond  dispute  and  the  facts  are  clear.  Sea  levels  are  rising.  Coastlines   are  shrinking.  We   ve  seen  record  drought,  spreading  famine,  and  storms  that  are  growing   stronger  with  each  passing  hurricane  season.   Climate  change  and  our  dependence  on  foreign  oil,  if  left  unaddressed,  will  continue  to   weaken  our  economy  and  threaten  our  national  security.   I  know  many  of  you  are  working  to  confront  this  challenge.  In  particular,  I  want  to  commend   Governor  Sebelius,  Governor  Doyle,  Governor  Crist,  Governor  Blagojevich  and  your  host,   Governor  Schwarzenegger.  All  of  you  have  shown  true  leadership  in  the  fight  to  combat  global   warming.  And  we   ve  also  seen  a  number  of  businesses  doing  their  part  by  investing  in  clean   energy  technologies.   But  too  often,  Washington  has  failed  to  show  the  same  kind  of  leadership.  That  will  change   when  I  take  office.  My  presidency  will  mark  a  new  chapter  in  America   s  leadership  on  climate   change  that  will  strengthen  our  security  and  create  millions  of  new  jobs  in  the  process.  That   will  start  with  a  federal  cap  and  trade  system. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.  Property  of     Copyright    2010.  All  rights  reserved.   Page  1      We'll  establish  strong  annual  targets  that  set  us  on  a  course  to  reduce  emissions  to  their  1990   levels  by  2020  and  reduce  them  an  additional  80%  by  2050.  Further,  we'll  invest  15  billion   dollars  each  year  to  catalyze  private  sector  efforts  to  build  a  clean  energy  future.  We'll  invest   in  solar  power,  wind  power,  and  next  generation  biofuels.  We'll  tap  nuclear  power,  while   making  sure  it   s  safe    and  we'll  develop  clean  coal  technologies.   This  investment  will  not  only  help  us  reduce  our  dependence  on  foreign  oil,  making  the  United   States  more  secure    and  it  will  not  only  help  us  bring  about  a  clean  energy  future,  saving  the   planet.  It  will  also  help  us  transform  our  industries  and  steer  our  country  out  of  this  economic   crisis  by  generating  five  million  new  green  jobs  that  pay  well  and  can   t  be  outsourced.   The  truth  is,  the  United  States  can't  meet  this  challenge  alone.  Solving  this  problem  will   require  all  of  us  working  together.  I  understand  that  your  meeting  is  being  attended  by   government  officials  from  over  a  dozen  countries,  including  the  UK,  Canada,  Mexico,  Brazil   and  Chile,  Poland  and  Australia,  India  and  Indonesia.  And  I  look  forward  to  working  with  all   nations  to  meet  this  challenge  in  the  coming  years.   Let  me  also  say  a  special  word  to  the  delegates  from  around  the  world  who  will  gather  at   Poland  next  month.  Your  work  is  vital  to  the  planet.  While  I  won   t  be  President  at  the  time  of   your  meeting  and  while  the  United  States  has  only  one  President  at  a  time,  I   ve  asked   Members  of  Congress  who  are  attending  the  conference  as  observers  to  report  back  to  me  on   what  they  learn  there.  And  once  I  take  office,  you  can  be  sure  that  the  United  States  will  once   again  engage  vigorously  in  these  negotiations,  and  help  lead  the  world  toward  a  new  era  of   global  cooperation  on  climate  change.   Now  is  the  time  to  confront  this  challenge  once  and  for  all.  Delay  is  no  longer  an  option.   Denial  is  no  longer  an  acceptable  response.  The  stakes  are  too  high    the  consequences  too   serious.  Stopping  climate  change  won   t  be  easy  and  it  won   t  happen  overnight.  But  I  promise   you  this:  When  I  am  President,  any  governor  who   s  willing  to  promote  clean  energy  will  have   a  partner  in  the  White  House.  Any  company  that   s  willing  to  invest  in  clean  energy  will  have   an  ally  in  Washington.  And  any  nation  that   s  willing  to  join  the  cause  of  combating  climate   change  will  have  an  ally  in  the  United  States  of  America.   Thank  you. Transcription  by  Michael  E.

"The  news  this  past  week,  including  this  morning   s  news  about  Citigroup,  has  made  it  even   more  clear  that  we  are  facing  an  economic  crisis  of  historic  proportions.  Our  financial  markets   are  under  stress.  New  home  purchases  in  October  were  the  lowest  in  half  a  century.  Recently,   more  than  half  a  million  jobless  claims  were  filed,  the  highest  in  18  years.  And  if  we  do  not   act  swiftly  and  boldly,  most  experts  now  believe  that  we  could  lose  millions  of  jobs  next  year.   While  we  can   t  underestimate  the  challenges  that  we  face,  we  also  can   t  underestimate  our   capacity  to  overcome  them,  to  summon  that  spirit  of  determination  and  optimism  that  has   always  defined  us,  and  to  move  forward  in  a  new  direction  to  create  new  jobs,  reform  our   financial  system,  and  fuel  long  term  economic  growth.   We  know  this  won   t  be  easy,  and  it  won   t  happen  overnight.  We   ll  need  to  bring  together  the   best  minds  in  America  to  guide  us,  and  that  is  what  I   ve  sought  to  do  in  assembling  my   economic  team.  I   ve  sought  leaders  who  could  offer  both  sound  judgment  and  fresh  thinking,   both  a  depth  of  experience  and  a  wealth  of  bold,  new  ideas,  and  most  of  all  who  share  my   fundamental  belief  that  we  cannot  have  a  thriving  Wall  Street  without  a  thriving  Main  Street,   that  in  this  country  we  rise  or  fall  as  one  nation,  as  one  people.   Today,  Vice  President  elect  Biden  and  I  are  pleased  to  announce  the  nomination  of  four   individuals  who  meet  these  criteria  to  lead  our  economic  team:  Timothy  Geithner,  as  secretary   of  treasury    Lawrence  Summers,  as  the  director  of  our  National  Economic  Council    Christina   Romer,  as  chair  of  the  Council  of  Economic  Advisers    and  Melody  Barnes,  as  director  of  the   Domestic  Policy  Council. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Property  of  .       Copyright  2008.  All  rights  reserved.   Page  1      Having  served  in  senior  roles  at  Treasury,  the  IMF,  and  the  New  York  Fed,  Tim  Geithner  offers   not  just  extensive  experience  shaping  economic  policy  and  managing  financial  markets,  he   also  has  an  unparalleled  understanding  of  our  current  economic  crisis  in  all  of  its  depth,   complexity,  and  urgency.  Tim  will  waste  no  time  getting  up  to  speed.  He  will  start  his  first  day   on  the  job  with  a  unique  insight  into  the  failures  of  today   s  markets  and  a  clear  vision  of  the   steps  we  must  take  to  revive  them.  The  reality  is  that  the  economic  crisis  we  face  is  no  longer   just  an  American  crisis    it   s  a  global  crisis.  And  we  will  need  to  reach  out  to  countries  around   the  world  to  craft  a  global  response.  Tim   s  extensive  international  experience  makes  him   uniquely  suited  to  do  that  work.   Growing  up  partly  in  Africa  and  having  lived  and  worked  throughout  Asia,  having  served  as   undersecretary  of  the  treasury  for  international  affairs,  one  of  the  many  roles  in  the   international  arena,  and  having  studied  both  Chinese  and  Japanese,  Tim  understands  the   language  of  today   s  international  markets  in  more  ways  than  one.  Tim  served  with  distinction   under  both  Democrats  and  Republicans  and  has  a  long  history  of  working  comfortably  and  as   an  honest  broker  on  both  sides  of  the  aisle.  With  stellar  performances  and  outstanding  results   at  every  stage  of  his  career,  Tim  has  earned  the  confidence  and  respect  of  business,  financial,   and  community  leaders,  members  of  Congress,  and  political  leaders  around  the  world.  And  I   know  he  will  do  so  once  again  as  America   s  next  treasury  secretary,  the  chief  economic   spokesman  for  my  Administration.   Now,  like  Tim,  Larry  Summers  also  brings  a  singular  combination  of  skill,  intellect,  and   experience  to  the  role  he  will  play  in  our  Administration.  As  undersecretary,  deputy  secretary,   and  then  secretary  of  the  treasury,  Larry  helped  guide  us  through  several  major  international   financial  crises  and  was  a  central  architect  of  the  policies  that  led  to  the  longest  economic   expansion  in  American  history,  with  record  surpluses,  rising  family  incomes,  and  more  than  20   million  new  jobs.  He  also  championed  a  range  of  measures,  from  tax  credits  to  enhanced   lending  programs  to  consumer  financial  protections,  that  greatly  benefited  middle  income   families.   As  a  thought  leader,  Larry  has  urged  us  to  confront  the  problems  of  income  inequality  and  the   middle  class  squeeze,  consistently  arguing  that  the  key  to  a  strong  economy  is  a  strong,   vibrant,  growing  middle  class.  This  idea  is  at  the  core  of  my  own  economic  philosophy  and  will   be  the  foundation  of  all  of  my  economic  policies.   And  as  one  of  the  great  economic  minds  of  our  time,  Larry  has  earned  a  global  reputation  for   being  able  to  cut  to  the  heart  of  the  most  complex  and  novel  policy  challenges.  With  respect   to  both  our  current  financial  crisis  and  other  pressing  economic  issues  of  our  time,  his   thinking,  writing,  and  speaking  have  set  the  terms  of  the  debate.  I   m  glad  he  will  be  by  my   side,  playing  the  critical  role  of  coordinating  my  Administration   s  economic  policy  in  the  White   House,  and  I  will  rely  heavily  on  his  advice  as  we  navigate  the  uncharted  waters  of  this   economic  crisis. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Property  of  .       Copyright  2008.  All  rights  reserved.   Page  2      As  one  of  the  most  expert  people  in  America  on  economic  crises  and  how  to  solve  them,  my   next  nominee,  Christina  Romer,  will  bring  a  critically  needed  perspective  to  her  work  as  chair   of  my  Council  of  Economic  Advisors.  Christina  is  both  a  leading  macroeconomist  and  a  leading   economic  historian,  perhaps  best  known  for  her  work  on  America   s  recovery  from  the  Great   Depression  and  the  robust  economic  expansion  that  followed.   Since  2003,  she   s  been  co  director  of  the  National  Bureau  of  Economic  Research  Monetary   Economics  program.  She   s  also  a  member  of  the  bureau   s  Business  Cycle  Dating  Committee,   the  body  charged  with  officially  determining  whether  a  recession  has  started  and  ended,   experience  which  will  serve  her  well  as  she  advises  me  on  our  current  economic  challenges.   Christina  has  done  groundbreaking  research  on  many  of  the  topics  our  Administration  will   confront,  from  tax  policy  to  fighting  recessions.  And  her  clear  eyed,  independent  analyses   have  received  praise  from  both  conservative  and  liberal  thinkers  alike.  I  look  forward  to  her   wise  counsel  in  the  White  House.   Finally,  we  know  that  rebuilding  our  economy  will  require  action  on  a  great  variety  of  fronts:   from  education  and  health  care  to  energy  and  Social  Security.  Without  sound  policies  in  these   areas,  we  can  neither  enjoy  sustained  economic  growth  nor  realize  our  full  potential  as  a   people.  So  I  am  extraordinarily  pleased  that  Melody  Barnes,  one  of  the  most  respected  policy   experts  in  America,  will  serve  as  my  director  of  the  Domestic  Policy  Council,  and  that  she  will   be  working  hand  in  hand  with  my  economic  policy  team  to  chart  a  course  to  economic   recovery.  An  integral  part  of  that  course  will  be  health  care  reform,  and  she  will  work  closely   with  my  secretary  of  health  and  human  services  on  that  issue.   As  executive  vice  president  for  policy  at  the  Center  for  American  Progress,  Melody  directed  a   network  of  policy  experts  dedicated  to  finding  solutions  for  struggling  middle  class  families.   She  also  served  as  chief  counsel  to  the  great  Senator  Ted  Kennedy  on  the  Senate  Judiciary   Committee,  working  on  issues  ranging  from  crime  to  immigration  to  bankruptcy,  and  fighting   tirelessly  to  protect  civil  rights,  women   s  rights,  and  religious  freedom.  Melody   s  brilliant  legal   mind  and  her  long  experience  working  to  secure  the  liberties  on  which  this  nation  was   founded,  as  well  as  to  secure  the  opportunities  for  those  who   ve  been  left  behind,  make  her  a   perfect  fit  for  DPC  director.   I'm  grateful  that  Tim,  Larry,  Christina,  and  Melody  have  accepted  my  nomination,  and  I  am   looking  forward  to  working  closely  with  them  in  the  months  ahead.  That  work  starts  today,   because  the  truth  is,  we  do  not  have  a  minute  to  waste.  Right  now,  our  economy  is  trapped  in   a  vicious  cycle:  The  turmoil  on  Wall  Street  means  a  new  round  of  belt  tightening  for  families   and  businesses  on  Main  Street,  and  as  folks  produce  less  and  consume  less,  that  just  deepens   the  problems  in  our  financial  markets.  These  extraordinary  stresses  on  our  financial  system   require  extraordinary  policy  responses.  And  my  Administration  will  honor  the  public   commitments  made  by  the  current  Administration  to  address  this  crisis.   Further,  beyond  any  immediate  actions  we  may  take,  we  need  a  recovery  plan  for  both  Wall   Street  and  Main  Street,  a  plan  that  stabilizes  our  financial  system  and  gets  credit  flowing Transcription  by  Michael  E.

Page  3      again,  while  at  the  same  time  addressing  our  growing  foreclosure  crisis,  helping  our  struggling   auto  industry,  and  creating  and  saving  2.5  million  jobs,  jobs  rebuilding  our  infrastructure,  our   roads,  our  bridges,  modernizing  our  schools,  and  creating  the  clean  energy  infrastructure  of   the  21st  century.  Because  at  this  moment,  we  need  to  restore  both  confidence  in  the  markets   and  restore  confidence  of  middle  class  families,  who  find  themselves  working  harder,  earning   less,  and  falling  further  and  further  behind.   I   ve  asked  my  economic  team  to  develop  recommendations  for  this  plan  and  to  consult  with   Congress,  the  current  Administration,  and  the  Federal  Reserve  on  immediate  economic   developments  over  the  next  two  months.  I   ve  requested  that  they  brief  me  on  these  matters   on  a  daily  basis.  And  in  the  coming  weeks,  I  will  provide  the  American  people  and  the   incoming  Congress  with  an  overview  of  their  initial  recommendations.  It  is  my  hope  that  the   new  Congress  will  begin  work  on  an  aggressive  economic  recovery  plan  when  they  convene  in   early  January  so  that  our  Administration  can  hit  the  ground  running.   With  our  economy  in  distress,  we  cannot  hesitate  and  we  cannot  delay.  Our  families  can   t   afford  to  keep  on  waiting  and  hoping  for  a  solution.  They  can   t  afford  to  watch  another  month   of  unpaid  bills  pile  up,  another  semester  of  tuition  slip  out  of  reach,  another  month  where,   instead  of  saving  for  retirement,  they   re  dipping  into  their  savings  just  to  get  by.  And  I  want   to  repeat:  This  will  not  be  easy.  There  are  no  shortcuts  or  quick  fixes  to  this  crisis,  which  has   been  many  years  in  the  making,  and  the  economy  is  likely  to  get  worse  before  it  gets  better.   Full  recovery  will  not  happen  immediately.  And  to  make  the  investments  we  need,  we   ll  have   to  scour  our  federal  budget,  line  by  line,  and  make  meaningful  cuts  and  sacrifices,  as  well,   something  I   ll  be  discussing  further  tomorrow.   Despite  all  of  this,  I  am  hopeful  about  the  future.  I  have  full  confidence  in  the  wisdom  and   ingenuity  of  my  economic  team  and  in  the  hard  work,  courage,  and  sacrifice  of  the  American   people.  And  most  of  all,  I  believe  deeply  in  the  resilience  and  the  spirit  of  this  nation.  I  know   we  can  work  our  way  out  of  this  crisis  because  we   ve  done  it  before.  And  I  know  we  will   succeed  once  again  if  we  put  aside  partisanship  and  politics  and  work  together.   That   s  exactly  what  I  intend  to  do  as  President  of  the  United  States. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Property  of  .       Copyright  2008.  All  rights  reserved.

"Good morning, everybody. I hope you all had a wonderful Thanksgiving. Last week, we announced our economic team, which is working as we speak to craft anEconomic Recovery Program to create jobs and grow our struggling economy. Today, VicePresident-elect Biden and I are pleased to announce our national security team. The national security challenges we face are just as grave -- and just as urgent -- as oureconomic crisis. We are fighting two wars. Our old conflicts remain unresolved, and newlyassertive powers have put strains on the international system. The spread of nuclear weaponsraises the peril that the world   s deadliest technologies could fall into dangerous hands. Ourdependence on foreign oil empowers authoritarian governments and endangers our planet. America must also be strong at home to be strong abroad. We need to provide education andopportunity to all our citizens, so every American can compete with anyone, anywhere. Andour economic power must sustain our military strength, our diplomatic leverage, and ourglobal leadership. The common thread linking these challenges is the fundamental reality that in the 21stcentury, our destiny is shared with the world's. From our markets to our security, from ourpublic health to our climate, we must act with the understanding that, now more than ever,we have a stake in what happens across the globe. And as we learned so painfully on 9/11,terror cannot be contained by borders, nor safety provided by oceans alone. Last week, we were reminded of this threat once again when terrorists took the lives of sixAmerican among nearly 200 victims in Mumbai. In the world we seek, there is no place forthose who kill innocent civilians to advance hateful extremism. This weekend, I told PrimeMinister Singh of India that Americans stand with the people of India in this dark time. And Iam confident that India's great democracy is more resilient than killers who would tear itdown. And so, in this uncertain world, the time has come for a new beginning -- a new dawn ofAmerican leadership to overcome the challenges of the 21st century, and to seize theopportunities embedded in those challenges. We will strengthen our capacity to defeat ourenemies and support our friends. We will renew old alliances and forge new and enduringpartnerships. We will show the world once more that America is relentless in the defense ofour people, steady in advancing our interests, and committed to the ideals that shine as abeacon to the world: democracy and justice; opportunity and unyielding hope -- becauseAmerican values are America   s greatest export to the world. To succeed, we must pursue a new strategy that skillfully uses, balances, and integrates allelements of American power: our military and diplomacy; our intelligence and lawenforcement; our economy and the power of our moral example. The team that we'veassembled here today is uniquely suited to do just that. In their past service and plans for the future, these men and women represent all of thoseelements of American power, and the very best of the American example. They've served inuniform and as diplomats; they have worked as legislators, law enforcement officials, andexecutives. They share my pragmatism about the use of power, and my sense of purposeabout America's role as a leader in the world. I have known Hillary Clinton as a friend, a colleague, a source of counsel, and as a campaignopponent. She possesses an extraordinary intelligence and a remarkable work ethic. I amproud that she will be our next Secretary of State. She is an American of tremendous staturewho will have my complete confidence, who knows many of the world's leaders, who willcommand respect in every capitol, and who will clearly have the ability to advance ourinterests around the world. Hillary   s appointment is a sign to friend and foe of the seriousness of my commitment torenew American diplomacy and restore our alliances. There is much to do -- from preventingthe spread of nuclear weapons to Iran and North Korea, to seeking a lasting peace betweenIsrael and the Palestinians, to strengthening international institutions. I have no doubt thatHillary Clinton is the right person to lead our State Department, and to work with me intackling this ambitious foreign policy agenda. At a time when we face unprecedented transition amidst two wars, I've have asked RobertGates to continue as Secretary of Defense, and I'm pleased that he's accepted. Two yearsago, he took over the Pentagon at a difficult time. He restored accountability. He won theconfidence of military commanders and the trust of our brave men and women in uniform, aswell as their families. He earned the respect of members of Congress on both sides of the aislefor his pragmatism and competence. He knows that we need a sustainable national securitystrategy -- and that includes a bipartisan consensus at home. As I said throughout the campaign, I will be giving Secretary Gates and our military a newmission as soon as I take office: responsibly ending the war in Iraq through a successfultransition to Iraqi control. We will also ensure that we have the strategy and resources tosucceed against al Qaeda and the Taliban. As Bob said not too long ago, Afghanistan is wherethe war on terror began, and it is where it must end. And going forward, we will continue tomake the investments necessary to strengthen our military and increase our ground forces todefeat the threats of the 21st century. Eric Holder has the talent and commitment to succeed as Attorney General from his first dayon the job, which is even more important in a transition that demands vigilance. He hasdistinguished himself as a prosecutor, a judge, and a senior official, and he is deeply familiarwith the law enforcement challenges we face -- from terrorism to counter-intelligence, fromwhite collar crime to public corruption. Eric also has the combination of toughness andindependence that we need at the Justice Department. Let me be clear: The Attorney Generalserves the American people. And I have every expectation that Eric will protect our people,uphold the public trust, and adhere to our Constitution. Janet Napolitano offers the experience and executive skills we need in the next Secretary ofHomeland Security. She has spent her career protecting people -- as a US Attorney, anAttorney General, and as the Governor of Arizona. She understands the need for aDepartment of Homeland Security that has the capacity to help prevent terrorist attacks andrespond to catastrophe -- be it manmade or natural. Janet assumes this critical role havinglearned the lessons -- some of them painful -- of the last several years, from 9/11 to Katrina.She insists on competence and accountability. She knows firsthand the need to have a partnerin Washington that works well with state and local governments. She understands as well asanyone the danger of an unsecure border. And she will be a leader who can reform asprawling Department while safeguarding our homeland. Susan Rice will take on the crucial task of serving as Permanent Representative of the UnitedStates to the United Nations. Susan has been a close and trusted advisor. As in previousAdministrations, the UN Ambassador will serve as a member of my cabinet and an integralmember of my team. Her background as a scholar, on the National Security Council, andAssistant Secretary of State will serve our nation well at the United Nations. Susan knows thatthe global challenges we face demand global institutions that work. She shares my belief thatthe UN is an indispensable and imperfect forum. She will carry the message that ourcommitment to multilateral action must be coupled with a commitment to reform. We needthe United Nations to be more effective as a venue for collective action -- against terror andproliferation, climate change and genocide, poverty and disease. Finally, I am convinced that General James Jones is uniquely suited to be a strong and skilledNational Security Advisor. Generations of Joneses have served heroically on the battlefield --from the beaches of Tarawa in World War II, to Foxtrot Ridge in Vietnam. Jim's Silver Star is aproud part of that legacy. He will bring to the job the dual experience of serving in uniformand as a diplomat. He has commanded a platoon in battle, served as Supreme AlliedCommander in a time of war, and worked on behalf of peace in the Middle East. Jim is focusedon the threats of today and the future. He understands the connection between energy andnational security, and has worked on the frontlines of global instability     from Kosovo tonorthern Iraq to Afghanistan. He will advise me and work effectively to integrate our effortsacross the government, so that we are effectively using all elements of American power todefeat unconventional threats and promote our values. I am confident that this team is what we need to make a new beginning for American nationalsecurity. This morning, we met to discuss the situation in Mumbai and some of the challengesthat we face in the months and years ahead. In the coming weeks, I will be in close contactwith these advisors, who will be working with their counterparts in the Bush Administration tomake sure that we are ready to hit the ground running on January 20th. Given the range ofthreats that we face and the vulnerability that can be a part of every presidential transition, Ihope that we can proceed swiftly for those national security officials who demandconfirmation. We move forward with the humility that comes with knowing that there are brave men andwomen protecting us on our front lines: diplomats and intelligence officers in dangerouscorners of the world, troops serving their second, third, or fourth tours; FBI agents in thefield, cops on the beat, prosecutors in our courts, and cargo inspectors at our ports. Theseselfless Americans whose names are unknown to most of us will form the backbone of oureffort. If we serve as well as they are serving, we will protect our country and promote ourvalues. And as we move forward with respect for America's tradition of a bipartisan national securitypolicy and a commitment to national unity, we have to recall that when it comes to keepingour nation and our people safe, we are not Republicans or Democrats: We are Americans. There's no monopoly of power or wisdom in either party. Together, as one nation, as onepeople, we can shape our times instead of being shaped by them. Together, we will meet thechallenges of the 21st century not with fear, but with hope.",obama
"Morning,  everybody.   Last  week,  Vice  President  Elect  Biden  and  I  began  the  process  of  announcing  our  economic   team.  Today,  we  are  pleased  to  name  another  key  member  of  this  team:  our  nominee  for   Secretary  of  Commerce,  my  great  friend,  Governor  Bill  Richardson.   With  each  passing  day,  the  work  our  team  has  begun,  developing  plans  to  revive  our   economy,  becomes  more  urgent.  Earlier  this  week,  we  learned  that  the  U.S.  economy  has   been  in  recession  since  December  of  2007  and  that  our  manufacturing  output  is  at  a  26  year   low        two  stark  reminders  of  the  magnitude  of  the  challenges  we  face.   But  while  I  know  rebuilding  our  economy  won   t  be  easy        and  it  won   t  be        happen  overnight         I  also  know  this:  that  right  now,  somewhere  in  America,  a  small  business  is  at  work  with   the  next  big  idea    a  scientist  is  on  the  cusp  of  the  next  big  breakthrough  discovery    an   entrepreneur  is  sketching  plans  for  the  startup  that  will  revolutionize  an  industry.  Right  now,   across  America,  the  finest  products  in  the  world  are  rolling  off  our  assembly  lines.  And  the   proudest,  most  determined,  most  productive  workers  in  the  world  are  on  the  job        some,   already  on  their  second  shift  of  the  day    many,  putting  in  longer  hours  than  ever  before.   After  nearly  two  years  of  traveling  across  this  country,  meeting  with  workers,  visiting   businesses  large  and  small,  I  am  more  confident  than  ever  that  we  have  everything  we  need   to  renew  our  economy.  We've  got  the  ingenuity,  the  technology,  the  skill,  and  commitment     we  just  need  to  put  it  to  work. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Property  of  .       Copyright  2008.  All  rights  reserved.   Page  1      It   s  time  to  not  just  address  the  immediate  economic  threats,  but  to  start  laying  the   groundwork  for  long  term  prosperity  to  help  American  businesses  grow  and  thrive  at  home,   and  expand  our  efforts  to  promote  American  enterprise  around  the  world.   This  work  is  the  core  mission  of  the  Secretary  of  Commerce.  And  with  his  breadth  and  depth   of  experience  in  public  life,  Governor  Richardson  is  uniquely  suited  for  this  role  as  a  leading   economic  diplomat  for  America.  During  his  time  in  state  government  and  Congress,  and  in   tour        two  tours  of  duty  in  the  cabinet,  Bill  has  seen  from  just  about  every  angle  what  makes   our  economy  work  and  what  keeps  it  from  working  better.   As  Governor  of  New  Mexico,  Bill  showed  how  government  can  act  as  a  partner  to  support  our   businesses,  helping  to  create  80,000  new  jobs.  And  under  his  leadership,  New  Mexico  saw  the   lowest  unemployment  rate  in  decades.   As  a  former  Secretary  of  Energy,  Bill  understands  the  steps  we  must  take  to  build  a  new,   clean  energy  industry  and  create  the  green  jobs  of  the  twenty  first  century         jobs  that  pay   well  and  won   t  be  outsourced    jobs  that  will  help  us  end  our  dependence  on  foreign  oil.   And  as  a  former  Ambassador  to  the  United  Nations,  Bill  brings  both  international  stature  and  a   deep  understanding  of  today   s  global  economy.  He  understands  that  the  success  of  today   s   business  in  Detroit  or  Columbus  often  depends  on  whether  it  can  sell  products  in  places  like   Santiago  or  Shanghai.  And  he  knows  that  America   s  reputation  in  the  world  is  critical  not  just   to  our  security,  but  to  our  prosperity        (excuse  me)        that  when  the  citizens  of  the  world   respect  America   s  leadership,  they  are  more  likely  to  buy  America   s  products.   To  this  crucial  work  of  restoring  America   s  international  standing,  Bill  will  bring  a  leadership   style  all  his  own.  Bill  has  never  been  content  to  just  learn  from  briefing  books,  never  satisfied   with  only  the  official  version  of  the  story.  During  his  time  in  Congress,  he  held  more  than  two         2,500  town  hall  meetings,  so  he  could  hear  directly  from  constituents.  He  was  a  regular  in   the  U.N.  cafeteria,  mixing  it  up  with  U.N.  employees  over  lunch.  And  during  his  2002   campaign  for  record        for  Governor,  he  actually  broke  a  world  record  by  shaking  nearly   14,000  hands  in  just  eight  hours.   (I've  got  to  check  that  statistic.)   All  of  this  reflects  a  determination  to  reach  out  and  understand  where  people  are  coming   from,  what  they  hope  for,  and  what  he  can  do  to  help.  This  approach,  I  believe,  has  been  the   key  to  Bill   s  success  as  a  negotiator  and  will  be  key  to  his  work  on  the  critical  functions  of  the   Commerce  Department        from  administering  our  census  and  monitoring  our  climate  to   protecting  our  intellectual  property  and  restoring  our  economic  diplomacy.   In  the  end,  Bill  Richardson  is  a  leader  who  shares  my  values,  and  he  must        and  he  will  be   measured  his  progress  the  same  way  I  do.  Are  we  creating  good  jobs  instead  of  losing  them?   Are  incomes  growing  instead  of  shrinking?  I  know  Bill  will  be  an  unyielding  advocate  for   American  business  and  American  jobs  at  home  and  around  the  world.  And  I  look  forward  to   working  with  him  in  the  years  ahead. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Property  of  .       Copyright  2008.  All  rights  reserved.

"Let me begin by thanking George Mason University for their extraordinary hospitality and tothank all the great friends, the governors, the mayors who are in attendance here today. Throughout America's history, there have been some years that simply rolled into the nextwithout much notice or fanfare. And then there are the years that come along once in ageneration, the kind that mark a clean break from a troubled past and set a new course forour nation. This is one of those years. We start 2009 in the midst of a crisis unlike any we have seen in our lifetime, a crisis that hasonly deepened over the last few weeks. Nearly two million jobs have been now lost. And onFriday, we're likely to learn that we lost more jobs last year than at any time since World WarII. Just in the past year, another 2.8 million Americans who want and need full-time workhave had to settle for part-time jobs. Manufacturing has hit a 28-year low. Many businessescannot borrow or make payroll. Many families cannot pay their bills or their mortgage. Manyworkers are watching their life savings disappear. And many, many Americans are bothanxious and uncertain of what the future will hold. Now, I don't believe it's too late to change course, but it will be if we don't take dramaticaction as soon as possible. If nothing is done, this recession could linger for years. Theunemployment rate could reach double digits. Our economy could fall 1 trillion dollars short ofits full capacity, which translates into more than 12,000 dollars in lost income for a family offour. We could lose a generation of potential and promise as more young Americans are forced toforego dreams of college or the chance to train for the jobs of the future. And our nation couldlose the competitive edge that has served as a foundation for our strength and our standing inthe world. In short, a bad situation could become dramatically worse. This crisis did not happen solely by some accident of history or normal turn of the businesscycle. And we won't get out of it by simply waiting for a better day to come or relying on theworn-out dogmas of the past. We arrived at this point due to an era of profoundirresponsibility that stretched from corporate board rooms to the halls of power inWashington, D.C. For years, too many Wall Street executives made imprudent and dangerous decisions, seekingprofits with too little regard for risk, too little regulatory scrutiny, and too little accountability.Banks made loans without concern for whether borrowers could repay them, and someborrowers took advantage of cheap credit to take on debt they couldn't afford. Politiciansspent taxpayer money without wisdom or discipline and too often focused on scoring politicalpoints instead of problems they were sent here to solve. The result has been a devastatingloss of trust and confidence in our economy, our financial markets, and our government. Now, the very fact that this crisis is largely of our own making means that it's not beyond ourability to solve. Our problems are rooted in past mistakes, not our capacity for futuregreatness. It will take time -- perhaps many years -- but we can rebuild that lost trust andconfidence. We can restore opportunity and prosperity. We should never forget that ourworkers are still more productive than any on Earth. Our universities are still the envy of theworld. We are still home to the most brilliant minds, the most creative entrepreneurs, and themost advanced technology and innovation that history has ever known. And we are still thenation that has overcome great fears and improbable odds. If we act with the urgency andseriousness that this moment requires, I know that we can do it again. That is why I have moved quickly to work with my economic team and leaders of both partieson an American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan that will immediately jump-start job creationand long-term growth. It's a plan that represents not just new policy, but a whole newapproach to meeting our most urgent challenges. For if we hope to end this crisis, we mustend the culture of anything goes that helped create it, and this change must begin inWashington. It's time to trade old habits for a new spirit of responsibility. It's time to finallychange the ways of Washington so that we can set a new and better course for America. There is no doubt that the cost of this plan will be considerable. It will certainly add to thebudget deficit in the short term. But equally certain are the consequences of doing too little ornothing at all, for that will lead to an even greater deficit of jobs, incomes, and confidence inour economy. It is true that we cannot depend on government alone to create jobs or long-term growth. Butat this particular moment, only government can provide the short-term boost necessary to liftus from a recession this deep and severe. Only government can break the cycle that are [sic]crippling our economy, where a lack of spending leads to lost jobs, which leads to even lessspending, where an inability to lend and borrow stops growth and leads to even less credit.That's why we need to act boldly and act now to reverse these cycles. That's why we need toput money in the pockets of the American people, create new jobs, and invest in our future.That's why we need to restart the flow of credit and restore the rules of the road that willensure a crisis like this never happens again. Now this plan begins with -- this plan must begin today, a plan I am confident will save orcreate at least three million jobs over the next few years. It's not just another public worksprogram. It's a plan that recognizes both the paradox and promise of this moment: the factthat there are millions of Americans trying to find work, even as all around the country there'sso much work to be done. And that's why we'll invest in priorities like energy and education,health care and a new infrastructure that are necessary to keep us strong and competitive inthe 21st century. That's why the overwhelming majority of the jobs created will be in theprivate sector, while our plan will save the public sector jobs of teachers, police officers,firefighters, and others who provide vital services. To finally spark the creation of a clean energy economy, we will double the production ofalternative energy in the next three years. We will modernize more than 75 percent of federalbuildings and improve the energy efficiency of 2 million American homes, saving consumersand taxpayers billions on our energy bills. In the process, we will put Americans to work in new jobs that pay well and can't beoutsourced, jobs building solar panels and wind turbines, constructing fuel-efficient cars andbuildings, and developing the new energy technologies that will lead to even more jobs, moresavings, and a cleaner, safer planet in the bargain. To improve the quality of our health care while lowering its cost, we will make the immediateinvestments necessary to ensure that, within five years, all of America's medical records arecomputerized. This will cut waste, eliminate red tape and reduce the need to repeat expensivemedical tests. But it just won't save billions of dollars and thousands of jobs; it will save livesby reducing the deadly but preventable medical errors that pervade our health care system. To give our children the chance to live out their dreams in a world that's never been morecompetitive, we will equip tens of thousands of schools, community colleges, and publicuniversities with 21st century classrooms, labs, and libraries. We'll provide new computers,new technology, and new training for teachers so that students in Chicago and Boston cancompete with children in Beijing for the high-tech, high-wage jobs of the future. To build an economy that can lead this future, we will begin to rebuild America. Yes, we'll putpeople to work repairing crumbling roads, bridges, and schools by eliminating the backlog ofwell-planned, worthy, and needed infrastructure projects. But we'll also do more to retrofitAmerica for a global economy. That means updating the way we get our electricity by startingto build a new smart grid that will save us money, protect our power sources from blackout orattack, and deliver clean, alternative forms of energy to every corner of our nation. It meansexpanding broadband lines across America, so that a small business in a rural town canconnect and compete with their counterparts anywhere in the world. It means investing in thescience, research, and technology that will lead to new medical breakthroughs, newdiscoveries, and entire new industries. And finally, this recovery and reinvestment plan will provide immediate relief to states,workers, and families who are bearing the brunt of this recession. To get people spendingagain, 95% of working families will receive a thousand dollar tax cut -- the first stage of amiddle-class tax cut that I promised during the campaign and will include in our next budget.To help Americans who have lost their jobs and can't find new ones, we'll continue thebipartisan extension of unemployment insurance and health care coverage to help themthrough this crisis. Government at every level will have to tighten its belt, but we'll helpstruggling states avoid harmful budget cuts, as long as they take responsibility and use themoney to maintain essential services like police, fire, education, and health care. Now I understand that some might be skeptical of this plan. Our government has alreadyspent a good deal of money, but we haven't yet seen that translate into more jobs or higherincomes or renewed confidence in our economy. And that's why the American Recovery andReinvestment Plan won't just throw money at our problems; we'll invest in what works. Thetrue test of policies we'll pursue won't be whether they're Democratic or Republican ideas,whether they're conservative or liberal ideas, but whether they create jobs, grow oureconomy, and put the American Dream within the reach of the American people. Instead of politicians doling out money behind a veil of secrecy, decisions about where weinvest will be made transparently, and informed by independent experts wherever possible.Every American will be able to hold Washington accountable for these decisions by goingonline to see how and where their taxpayer dollars are being spent. And as I announcedyesterday, we will launch an unprecedented effort to eliminate unwise and unnecessaryspending that has never been more unaffordable for our nation and our children's future thanit is right now. We have to make tough choices and smart investments today so that as the economyrecovers, the deficits start coming down. We cannot have a solid recovery if our people andour businesses don't have confidence that we're getting our fiscal house in order. And that'swhy our goal is not to create a slew of new government programs, but a foundation for long- term economic growth. That also means an economic recovery plan that is free from earmarksand pet projects. I understand that every member of Congress has ideas about how to spendmoney. Many of these projects are worthy. They benefit local communities. But this emergency legislation must not be the vehicle for those aspirations. This must be atime when leaders in both parties put the urgent needs of our nation above our own narrowinterests. Now, this recovery plan alone will not solve all the problems that led us into this crisis. Wemust also work with the same sense of urgency to stabilize and repair the financial system weall depend on. That means using our full arsenal of tools to get credit flowing again to familiesand businesses, while restoring confidence in our markets. It means launching a sweepingeffort to address the foreclosure crisis so that we can keep responsible families in their homes.It means preventing the catastrophic failure of financial institutions whose collapse couldendanger the entire economy, but only with maximum protections for taxpayers and a clearunderstanding that government support for any company is an extraordinary action that mustcome with significant restrictions on the firms that receive support. And it means reforming aweak and outdated regulatory system so that we can better withstand financial shocks andbetter protect consumers, investors, and businesses from the reckless greed and risk-takingthat must never endanger our prosperity again. No longer can we allow Wall Street wrongdoers to slip through regulatory cracks. No longercan we allow special interests to put their thumbs on the economic scales. No longer can weallow the unscrupulous lending and borrowing that leads only to destructive cycles of bubbleand bust. It is time to set a new course for this economy, and that change must begin now. We should have an open and honest discussion about this recovery plan in the days ahead,but I urge Congress to move as quickly as possible on behalf of the American people. Forevery day we wait or point fingers or drag our feet, more Americans will lose their jobs. Morefamilies will lose their savings. More dreams will be deferred and denied. And our nation willsink deeper into a crisis that, at some point, we may not be able to reverse. That is not the country I know. It is not a future I accept as President of the United States. Aworld that depends on the strength of our economy is now watching and waiting for Americato lead once more. And that is what we will do. It will not come easy or happen overnight, and it is altogether likely that things may get worsebefore they get better. But that is all the more reason for Congress to act without delay. Iknow the scale of this plan is unprecedented, but so is the severity of our situation. We havealready tried the wait-and-see approach to our problems, and it is the same approach thathelped lead us to this day of reckoning. And that is why the time has come to build a 21st century economy in which hard work andresponsibility are once again rewarded. That's why I'm asking Congress to work with me andmy team day and night, on weekends if necessary, to get the plan passed in the next fewweeks. That's why I'm calling on all Americans -- Democrats and Republicans and Independents -- toput -- to put good ideas ahead of the old ideological battles; a sense of common purposeabove the same narrow partisanship; and insist that the first question each of us asks isn't,""What's good for me?"" but ""What's good for the country my children will inherit?"" More than any program or policy, it is this spirit that will enable us to confront thesechallenges with the same spirit that has led previous generations to face down war, anddepression, and fear itself. And if we do, if we are able to summon that spirit again, if we areable to look out for one another, and listen to one another, and do our part for our nation andfor posterity, then I have no doubt that years from now, we will look back on 2009 as one ofthose years that marked another new and hopeful beginning for the United States of America.

"Hello  America!   I  want  to  thank  all  the  speakers  and  performers  today  for  reminding  us,  through  song  and   through  words,  just  what  it  is  that  we  love  about  America.  I  want  to  thank  all  of  you  for   braving  the  cold  and  the  crowds  and  traveling  in  some  cases  thousands  of  miles  to  join  us   here  today.  Welcome  to  Washington,  and  welcome  to  this  celebration  of  American  renewal.   In  the  course  of  our  history,  only  a  handful  of  generations  have  been  asked  to  confront   challenges  as  serious  as  the  ones  we  face  right  now.  Our  nation  is  at  war.  Our  economy  is  in   crisis.  Millions  of  Americans  are  losing  their  jobs  and  their  homes.  They're  worried  about  how   they'll  afford  college  for  their  kids  or  pay  the  stack  of  bills  on  their  kitchen  table.  And  most  of   all,  they're  anxious  and  uncertain  about  the  future        about  whether  this  generation  of   Americans  will  be  able  to  pass  on  what's  best  about  this  country  to  our  children  and  their   children.   I  won't  pretend  that  meeting  any  one  of  these  challenges  will  be  easy.  It  will  take  more  than  a   month  or  a  year,  and  it  will  likely  take  many.  Along  the  way  there  will  be  setbacks  and  false   starts  and  days  that  test  our  resolve  as  a  nation.   But  despite  all  this        despite  the  enormity  of  the  task  that  lies  ahead        I  stand  here  today  as   hopeful  as  ever  that  the  United  States  of  America  will  endure,  that  it  will  prevail,  that  the   dream  of  our  Founders  will  live  on  in  our  time.

Page  1      What  gives  me  hope  is  what  I  see  when  I  look  out  across  this  mall.  For  in  these  monuments   are  chiseled  those  unlikely  stories  that  affirm  our  unyielding  faith        a  faith  that  anything  is   possible  in  America.  Rising  before  us  stands  a  memorial  to  a  man  who  led  a  small  band  of   farmers  and  shopkeepers  in  revolution  against  the  army  of  an  empire,  all  for  the  sake  of  an   idea.   On  the  ground  below  is  a  tribute  to  a  generation  that  withstood  war  and  depression        men   and  women  like  my  grandparents  who  toiled  on  bomber  assembly  lines  and  marched  across   Europe  to  free  the  world  from  tyranny's  grasp.  Directly  in  front  of  us  is  a  pool  that  still  reflects   the  dream  of  a  King,  and  the  glory  of  a  people  who  marched  and  bled  so  that  their  children   might  be  judged  by  their  character's  content.  And  behind  me,  watching  over  the  union  he   saved,  sits  the  man  who  in  so  many  ways  made  this  day  possible.   And  yet,  as  I  stand  here  today,  what  gives  me  the  greatest  hope  of  all  is  not  the  stone  and   marble  that  surrounds  us,  but  what  fills  the  spaces  in  between.  It  is  you        Americans  of  every   race  and  region  and  station  who  came  here  because  you  believe  in  what  this  country  can  be   and  because  you  want  to  help  us  get  there.   It's  the  same  thing  that  gave  me  hope  from  the  day  we  began  this  campaign  for  the   presidency  nearly  two  years  ago:  a  belief  that  if  we  could  just  recognize  ourselves  in  one   another  and  bring  everyone  together        Democrats,  Republicans,  Independents    Latino,  Asian   and  Native  American    black  and  white,  gay  and  straight,  disabled  and  then  not  only  would  we   restore  hope  and  opportunity  in  places  that  yearned  for  both,  but  maybe,  just  maybe,  we   might  perfect  our  union  in  the  process.   This  is  what  I  believed,  but  you  made  this  belief  real.  You  proved  once  more  that  people  who   love  this  country  can  change  it.  And  as  I  prepare  to  assume  the  presidency,  yours  are  the   voices  I  will  take  with  me  every  day  when  I  walk  into  that  Oval  Office        the  voices  of  men  and   women  who  have  different  stories  but  hold  common  hopes    who  ask  only  for  what  was   promised  us  as  Americans        that  we  might  make  of  our  lives  what  we  will  and  see  our   children  climb  higher  than  we  did.   It  is  this  thread  that  binds  us  together  in  common  effort    that  runs  through  every  memorial  on   this  mall    that  connects  us  to  all  those  who  struggled  and  sacrificed  and  stood  here  before.  It   is  how  this  nation  has  overcome  the  greatest  differences  and  the  longest  odds        because   there  is  no  obstacle  that  can  stand  in  the  way  of  millions  of  voices  calling  for  change.  That  is   the  belief  with  which  we  began  this  campaign,  and  that  is  how  we  will  overcome  what  ails  us   now.   There  is  no  doubt  that  our  road  will  be  long,  that  our  climb  will  be  steep.  But  never  forget  that   the  true  character  of  our  nation  is  revealed  not  during  times  of  comfort  and  ease,  but  by  the   right  we  do  when  the  moment  is  hard.  I  ask  you  to  help  reveal  that  character  once  more,  and   together,  we  can  carry  forward  as  one  nation,  and  one  people,  the  legacy  of  our  forefathers   that  we  celebrate  today.

Thank you, thank you. My fellow citizens: I stand here today humbled by the task before us, grateful for the trust you've bestowed,mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors. I thank President Bush for his service to ournation, as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition. Forty-four Americans have now taken the presidential Oath.

Copyright Status: Property of At these moments, America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those inhigh office, but because We the People have remained faithful to the ideals of our forebearers[sic], and true to our founding documents. So it has been. So it must be with this generation of Americans. That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood. Our nation is at war, against a far- reaching network of violence and hatred. Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence ofgreed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hardchoices and prepare the nation for a new age. Homes have been lost; jobs shed; businessesshuttered. Our health care is too costly; our schools fail too many; and each day bringsfurther evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten ourplanet. These are the indicators of crisis, subject to data and statistics. Less measurable, but no lessprofound, is a sapping of confidence across our land -- a nagging fear that America's decline isinevitable, that the next generation must lower its sights. Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real. They are serious and they are many.They will not be met easily or in a short span of time. But know this, America: They will bemet. On this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflictand discord. On this day, we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises, therecriminations and worn out dogmas, that for far too long have strangled our politics. We remain a young nation, but in the words of Scripture, the time has come to ""set asidechildish things.""2 The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit; to choose our betterhistory; to carry forward that precious gift, that noble idea, passed on from generation togeneration: the God-given promise that all are equal, all are free, and all deserve a chance topursue their full measure of happiness. In reaffirming the greatness of our nation, we understand that greatness is never a given. Itmust be earned. Our journey has never been one of short-cuts or settling for less. It has notbeen the path for the faint-hearted -- for those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only thepleasures of riches and fame. Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers ofthings -- some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor, who havecarried us up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and freedom. For us, they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of anew life. Transcription date 2015 by Michael E. Eidenmuller. Copyright Status: Property of For us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West; endured the lash of the whip andplowed the hard earth. For us, they fought and died, in places like Concord and Gettysburg; Normandy and Khe Sahn. Time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their handswere raw so that we might live a better life. They saw America as bigger than the sum of ourindividual ambitions; greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction. This is the journey we continue today. We remain the most prosperous, powerful nation onEarth. Our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began. Our minds are no lessinventive, our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month orlast year. Our capacity remains undiminished. But our time of standing pat, of protectingnarrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions - that time has surely passed. Startingtoday, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remakingAmerica. For everywhere we look, there is work to be done. The state of our economy calls for action,bold and swift, and we will act -- not only to create new jobs, but to lay a new foundation forgrowth. We will build the roads and bridges, the electric grids and digital lines that feed ourcommerce and bind us together. We will restore science to its rightful place, and wieldtechnology's wonders to raise health care's quality and lower its cost. We will harness the sunand the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories. And we will transform ourschools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age. All this we can do. All this we will do. Now, there are some who question the scale of our ambitions -- who suggest that our systemcannot tolerate too many big plans. Their memories are short. For they have forgotten whatthis country has already done; what free men and women can achieve when imagination isjoined to common purpose, and necessity to courage. What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them -- that thestale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply. The question weask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works --whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that isdignified. Where the answer is yes, we intend to move forward. Where the answer is no,programs will end. And those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to account --to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do our business in the light of day -- because onlythen can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government. Transcription date 2015 by Michael E. Eidenmuller. Copyright Status: Property of Nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill. Its power togenerate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched, but this crisis has reminded us thatwithout a watchful eye, the market can spin out of control. The nation cannot prosper longwhen it favors only the prosperous. The success of our economy has always depended not juston the size of our Gross Domestic Product, but on the reach of our prosperity; on the ability toextend opportunity to every willing heart -- not out of charity, but because it is the surestroute to our common good. As for our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals.Our Founding Fathers, faced with perils that we can scarcely imagine, drafted a charter toassure the rule of law and the rights of man, a charter expanded by the blood of generations.Those ideals still light the world, and we will not give them up for expedience'[s] sake. And soto all the other peoples and governments who are watching today, from the grandest capitalsto the small village where my father was born: Know that America is a friend of each nationand every man, woman, and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity. And we are readyto lead once more. Recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles andtanks, but with the sturdy alliances and enduring convictions. They understood that our poweralone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please. Instead, they knew that ourpower grows through its prudent use; our security emanates from the justness of our cause,the force of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and restraint. We are the keepers of this legacy. Guided by these principles once more, we can meet thosenew threats that demand even greater effort -- even greater cooperation and understandingbetween nations. We will begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its people, and forge a hard- earned peace in Afghanistan. With old friends and former foes, we will work tirelessly tolessen the nuclear threat, and roll back the specter of a warming planet. We will not apologizefor our way of life, nor will we waver in its defense, and for those who seek to advance theiraims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit isstronger and cannot be broken. You cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you! For we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness. We are a nation ofChristians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus -- and non-believers. We are shaped by everylanguage and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth; and because we have tasted thebitter swill of civil war and segregation, and emerged from that dark chapter stronger andmore united, we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that thelines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as the world grows smaller, our common humanity shallreveal itself; and that America must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace. To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutualrespect. To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society'sills on the West -- know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what youdestroy.

Copyright Status: Property of To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, knowthat you are on the wrong side of history; but that we will extend a hand if you are willing tounclench your fist. To the people of poor nations, we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourishand let clean waters flow; to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds. And to thosenations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can no longer afford indifference to thesuffering outside our borders; nor can we consume the world's resources without regard toeffect. For the world has changed, and we must change with it. As we consider the road that unfolds before us, we remember with humble gratitude thosebrave Americans who, at this very hour, patrol far-off deserts and distant mountains. Theyhave something to tell us, just as the fallen heroes who lie in Arlington whisper through theages. We honor them not only because they are the guardians of our liberty, but because theyembody the spirit of service; a willingness to find meaning in something greater thanthemselves. And yet, at this moment -- a moment that will define a generation -- it isprecisely this spirit that must inhabit us all. For as much as government can do and must do, it is ultimately the faith and determination ofthe American people upon which this nation relies. It is the kindness to take in a strangerwhen the levees break, the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than seea friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours. It is the firefighter's courageto storm a stairway filled with smoke, but also a parent's willingness to nurture a child, thatfinally decides our fate. Our challenges may be new. The instruments with which we meet them may be new. Butthose values upon which our success depends -- honesty and hard work, courage and fairplay, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism -- these things are old. These things aretrue. They have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history. What is demandedthen is a return to these truths. What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility -- arecognition, on the part of every American, that we have duties to ourselves, our nation, andthe world, duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in theknowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit, so defining of our character, thangiving our all to a difficult task. This is the price and the promise of citizenship. This is the source of our confidence -- the knowledge that God calls on us to shape anuncertain destiny. This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed -- why men and women and children of everyrace and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall, and why a manwhose father less than sixty years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant cannow stand before you to take a most sacred Oath.

The snow was stained with blood.

"Let me first of all say how grateful I am for all of you being here, and how much weappreciate everything that you've done. I know that there are a lot of people here who havebeen so engaged in the campaign, have sacrificed so much, people who've been involved backsince 2007. And...so I...want all of you to know how appreciative I am. And I know many of you came here today for a campaign event. I was looking forward tohaving a fun conversation with you about some really important matters that we face as acountry and the differences between myself and my opponent in this election. But this morning, we woke up to news of a tragedy that reminds us of all the ways that weare united as one American family. By now, many of you know, many of you have heard that a few miles outside of Denver, in atown call Aurora, at least 12 people were killed when a gunman opened fire in a movietheater, and dozens more are being treated for injuries at a local hospital. Some of the victimsare being treated at a children   s hospital. Now, we   re still gathering all the facts about what happened in Aurora, but what we do knowis that the police have one suspect in custody. And the federal government stands ready to dowhatever is necessary to bring whoever is responsible for this heinous crime to justice -- andwe will take every step possible to ensure the safety of all of our people. We're going to stand by our neighbors in Colorado during this extraordinarily difficult time.And I had a chance to speak with the Mayor of Aurora as well as the Governor of Colorado toexpress, not just on behalf of Michelle and myself, but the entire American family, howheartbroken we are. Now, even as we learn how this happened and who's responsible, we may never understandwhat leads anybody to terrorize their fellow human beings like this. Such violence, such evil issenseless. It's beyond reason. But while we will never know fully what causes somebody to take the life of another, we doknow what makes life worth living. The people we lost in Aurora loved and they were loved.They were mothers and fathers; they were husbands and wives; sisters and brothers; sonsand daughters, friends and neighbors. They had hopes for the future and they had dreamsthat were not yet fulfilled. And if there   s anything to take away from this tragedy it   s the reminder that life is very fragile.Our time here is limited and it is precious. And what matters at the end of the day is not thesmall things; it   s not the trivial things, which so often consume us and our daily lives.Ultimately, it   s how we choose to treat one another and how we love one another. It's what we do on a daily basis to give our lives meaning and to give our lives purpose. That   swhat matters. At the end of the day, what we   ll remember will be those we loved and what wedid for others. That   s why we   re here. I   m sure that many of you who are parents here had the same reaction that I did when Iheard this news. My daughters go to the movies. What if Malia and Sasha had been at thetheater, as so many of our kids do every day? Michelle and I will be fortunate enough to hugour girls a little tighter tonight, and I   m sure you will do the same with your children. But forthose parents who may not be so lucky, we have to embrace them and let them know we willbe there for them as a nation. So, again, I am so grateful that all of you are here. I am...so moved by your support. Butthere are going to be other days for politics. This, I think, is a day for prayer and reflection. So what I   d ask everybody to do, I   d like us to pause in a moment of silence for the victims ofthis terrible tragedy, for the people who knew them and loved them, for those who are stillstruggling to recover, and for all the victims of less publicized acts of violence that plague ourcommunities every single day. So if everybody can just take a moment. [Silence observed] Thank you, everybody. I hope all of you will keep the people of Aurora in your hearts and minds today. May the Lordbring them comfort and healing in hard days to come. I am grateful to all of you, and I hope that as a consequence of today   s events, as you leavehere, you spend a little time thinking about the incredible blessings that God has given us. Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.",obama
"In short, if we do not act boldly and swiftly, a bad situation could become dramatically worse. That is why I have proposed an American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan to immediatelyjumpstart job creation as well as long-term economic growth. I am pleased to say that bothparties in Congress are already hard at work on this plan, and I hope to sign it into law in lessthan a month. It   s a plan that will save or create three to four million jobs over the next few years, and onethat recognizes both the paradox and the promise of this moment -- the fact that there aremillions of Americans trying to find work even as, all around the country, there   s so muchwork to be done. That   s why this is not just a short-term program to boost employment. It   sone that will invest in our most important priorities like energy and education; health care anda new infrastructure that are necessary to keep us strong and competitive in the 21st century. Today I   d like to talk specifically about the progress we expect to make in each of these areas. To accelerate the creation of a clean energy economy, we will double our capacity to generatealternative sources of energy like wind, solar, and biofuels over the next three years. We   llbegin to build a new electricity grid that lay down more than 3,000 miles of transmission linesto convey this new energy from coast to coast. We   ll save taxpayers $2 billion a year bymaking 75% of federal buildings more energy efficient, and save the average working family$350 on their energy bills by weatherizing 2.5 million homes. To lower health care cost, cut medical errors, and improve care, we   ll computerize the nation   shealth record in five years, saving billions of dollars in health care costs and countless lives.And we   ll protect health insurance for more than 8 million Americans who are in danger oflosing their coverage during this economic downturn. To ensure our children can compete and succeed in this new economy, we   ll renovate andmodernize 10,000 schools, building state-of-the-art classrooms, libraries, and labs to improvelearning for over five million students. We   ll invest more in Pell Grants to make collegeaffordable for seven million more students, provide a $2,500 college tax credit to four millionstudents, and triple the number of fellowships in science to help spur the next generation ofinnovation. Finally, we will rebuild and retrofit America to meet the demands of the 21st century. Thatmeans repairing and modernizing thousands of miles of America   s roadways and providingnew mass transit options for millions of Americans. It means protecting America by securing90 major ports and creating a better communications network for local law enforcement andpublic safety officials in the event of an emergency. And it means expanding broadbandaccess to millions of Americans, so business can compete on a level-playing field, whereverthey   re located. I know that some are skeptical about the size and scale of this recovery plan. I understandthat skepticism, which is why this recovery plan must and will include unprecedentedmeasures that will allow the American people to hold my Administration accountable for theseresults. We won   t just throw money at our problems -- we   ll invest in what works. Instead ofpoliticians doling out money behind a veil of secrecy, decisions about where we invest will bemade public, and informed by independent experts whenever possible. We   ll launch anunprecedented effort to root out waste, inefficiency, and unnecessary spending in ourgovernment, and every American will be able to see how and where we spend taxpayerdollars by going to a new website called recovery.gov. No one policy or program will solve the challenges we face right now, nor will this crisis recedein a short period of time. But if we act now and act boldly; if we start rewarding hard workand responsibility once more; if we act as citizens and not partisans and begin again the workof remaking America, then I have faith that we will emerge from this trying time evenstronger and more prosperous than we were before.

"Let me first of all say how grateful I am for all of you being here, and how much weappreciate everything that you've done. I know that there are a lot of people here who havebeen so engaged in the campaign, have sacrificed so much, people who've been involved backsince 2007. And...so I...want all of you to know how appreciative I am. And I know many of you came here today for a campaign event. I was looking forward tohaving a fun conversation with you about some really important matters that we face as acountry and the differences between myself and my opponent in this election. But this morning, we woke up to news of a tragedy that reminds us of all the ways that weare united as one American family. By now, many of you know, many of you have heard that a few miles outside of Denver, in atown call Aurora, at least 12 people were killed when a gunman opened fire in a movietheater, and dozens more are being treated for injuries at a local hospital. Some of the victimsare being treated at a children   s hospital. Now, we   re still gathering all the facts about what happened in Aurora, but what we do knowis that the police have one suspect in custody. And the federal government stands ready to dowhatever is necessary to bring whoever is responsible for this heinous crime to justice -- andwe will take every step possible to ensure the safety of all of our people. We're going to stand by our neighbors in Colorado during this extraordinarily difficult time.And I had a chance to speak with the Mayor of Aurora as well as the Governor of Colorado toexpress, not just on behalf of Michelle and myself, but the entire American family, howheartbroken we are. Now, even as we learn how this happened and who's responsible, we may never understandwhat leads anybody to terrorize their fellow human beings like this. Such violence, such evil issenseless. It's beyond reason. But while we will never know fully what causes somebody to take the life of another, we doknow what makes life worth living. The people we lost in Aurora loved and they were loved.They were mothers and fathers; they were husbands and wives; sisters and brothers; sonsand daughters, friends and neighbors. They had hopes for the future and they had dreamsthat were not yet fulfilled. And if there   s anything to take away from this tragedy it   s the reminder that life is very fragile.Our time here is limited and it is precious. And what matters at the end of the day is not thesmall things; it   s not the trivial things, which so often consume us and our daily lives.Ultimately, it   s how we choose to treat one another and how we love one another. It's what we do on a daily basis to give our lives meaning and to give our lives purpose. That   swhat matters. At the end of the day, what we   ll remember will be those we loved and what wedid for others. That   s why we   re here. I   m sure that many of you who are parents here had the same reaction that I did when Iheard this news. My daughters go to the movies. What if Malia and Sasha had been at thetheater, as so many of our kids do every day? Michelle and I will be fortunate enough to hugour girls a little tighter tonight, and I   m sure you will do the same with your children. But forthose parents who may not be so lucky, we have to embrace them and let them know we willbe there for them as a nation. So, again, I am so grateful that all of you are here. I am...so moved by your support. Butthere are going to be other days for politics. This, I think, is a day for prayer and reflection. So what I   d ask everybody to do, I   d like us to pause in a moment of silence for the victims ofthis terrible tragedy, for the people who knew them and loved them, for those who are stillstruggling to recover, and for all the victims of less publicized acts of violence that plague ourcommunities every single day. So if everybody can just take a moment. [Silence observed] Thank you, everybody. I hope all of you will keep the people of Aurora in your hearts and minds today. May the Lordbring them comfort and healing in hard days to come. I am grateful to all of you, and I hope that as a consequence of today   s events, as you leavehere, you spend a little time thinking about the incredible blessings that God has given us. Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.",obama
"Good morning President Taylor, Board of Trustees, faculty, parents, family, friends, thecommunity of Galesburg, the class of 1955 -- which I understand was out partying last night,and yet still showed up here on time -- and most of all, the Class of 2005. Congratulations onyour graduation, and thank you -- thank you for the honor of allowing me to be a part of it.Thank you also, Mr. President, for this honorary degree. It was only a couple of years ago thatI stopped paying my student loans in law school. Had I known it was this easy, I would haveran [sic] for the United States Senate earlier. You know, it has been about six months now since you sent me to Washington as your UnitedStates Senator. I recognize that not all of you voted for me, so for those of you mutteringunder your breath ""I didn   t send you anywhere,"" that's ok too. Maybe we   ll hold -- What doyou call it? -- a little Pumphandle after the ceremony. Change your mind for the next time. It has been a fascinating journey thus far. Each time I walk onto the Senate floor, I'mreminded of the history, for good and for ill, that has been made there. But there have been afew surreal moments. For example, I remember the day before I was sworn in, myself and my staff, we decided tohold a press conference in our office. Now, keep in mind that I am ranked 99th in seniority. Iwas proud that I wasn   t ranked dead last until I found out that it   s just because Illinois isbigger than Colorado. So I   m 99th in seniority, and all the reporters are crammed into the tinytransition office that I have, which is right next to the janitor   s closet in the basement of theDirksen Office Building. It   s my first day in the building, I have not taken a single vote, I havenot introduced one bill, had not even sat down in my desk, and this very earnest reporterraises his hand and says:    Senator Obama, what is your place in history?    I did what you just did, which is laugh out loud. I said, ""place in history?"" I thought he waskidding. At that point, I wasn   t even sure the other Senators would save a place for me at thecool kids    table. But as I was thinking about the words to share with this class, about what   s next, aboutwhat   s possible, and what opportunities lay ahead, I actually think it   s not a bad question foryou, the class of 2005, to ask yourselves: What will be your place in history? In other eras, across distant lands, this question could be answered with relative ease andcertainty. As a servant in Rome, you knew you   d spend your life forced to build somebodyelse   s Empire. As a peasant in 11th Century China, you knew that no matter how hard youworked, the local warlord might come and take everything you had -- and you also knew thatfamine might come knocking at the door. As a subject of King George, you knew that yourfreedom of worship and your freedom to speak and to build your own life would be ultimatelylimited by the throne. And then America happened. A place where destiny was not a destination, but a journey to be shared and shaped andremade by people who had the gall, the temerity to believe that, against all odds, they couldform    a more perfect union    on this new frontier. And as people around the world began to hear the tale of the lowly colonists who overthrewan empire for the sake of an idea, they started to come. Across oceans and the ages, theysettled in Boston and Charleston, Chicago and St. Louis, Kalamazoo and Galesburg, to try andbuild their own American Dream. This collective dream moved forward imperfectly -- it wasscarred by our treatment of native peoples, betrayed by slavery, clouded by the subjugationof women, shaken by war and depression. And yet, brick by brick, rail by rail, calloused handby calloused hand, people kept dreaming, and building, and working, and marching, andpetitioning their government, until they made America a land where the question of our placein history is not answered for us. It   s answered by us. Have we failed at times? Absolutely. Will you occasionally fail when you embark on your ownAmerican journey? You surely will. But the test is not perfection.The true test of the American ideal is whether we   re able to recognize our failings and thenrise together to meet the challenges of our time. Whether we allow ourselves to be shaped byevents and history, or whether we act to shape them. Whether chance of birth orcircumstance decides life   s big winners and losers, or whether we build a community where, atthe very least, everyone has a chance to work hard, get ahead, and reach their dreams. We have faced this choice before. At the end of the Civil War, when farmers and their families began moving into the cities towork in the big factories that were sprouting up all across America, we had to decide: Do wedo nothing and allow captains of industry and robber barons to run roughshod over theeconomy and workers by competing to see who can pay the lowest wages at the worstworking conditions? Or do we try to make the system work by setting up basic rules for themarket, instituting the first public schools, busting up monopolies, letting workers organizeinto unions? We chose to act, and we rose together. When the irrational exuberance of the Roaring Twenties came crashing down with the stockmarket, we had to decide: do we follow the call of leaders who would do nothing, or the call ofa leader who, perhaps because of his physical paralysis, refused to accept political paralysis? We chose to act -- regulating the market, putting people back to work, expanding bargainingrights to include health care and a secure retirement -- and together we rose. When World War II required the most massive home front mobilization in history and weneeded every single American to lend a hand, we had to decide: Do we listen to skeptics whotold us it wasn   t possible to produce that many tanks and planes? Or, did we build Roosevelt   sArsenal for Democracy and grow our economy even further by providing our returning heroeswith a chance to go to college and own their own home? Again, we chose to act, and again, we rose together. Today, at the beginning of this young century, we have to decide again. But this time, it isyour turn to choose. Here in Galesburg, you know what this new challenge is. You   ve seen it. All of you, your firstyear in college saw what happened at 9/11. It   s already been noted, the degree to which yourlives will be intertwined with the war on terrorism that currently is taking place. But whatyou   ve also seen, perhaps not as spectacularly, is the fact that when you drive by the oldMaytag plant around lunchtime, no one walks out anymore. I saw it during the campaign when I met union guys who worked at the plant for 20, 30 yearsand now wonder what they   re gonna do at the age of 55 without a pension or health care;when I met the man who   s son needed a new liver but because he   d been laid off, didn   t knowif he could afford to provide his child the care that he needed. It   s as if someone changed the rules in the middle of the game and no wonder -- no onebothered to tell these folks. And, in reality, the rules have changed. It started with technology and automation that rendered entire occupations obsolete. Whenwas the last time anybody here stood in line for the bank teller instead of going to the ATM, ortalked to a switchboard operator? Then it continued when companies like Maytag were able topick up and move their factories to some under developed country where workers were a lotcheaper than they are in the United States. As Tom Friedman points out in his new book, The World Is Flat, over the last decade or so,these forces -- technology and globalization -- have combined like never before. So that whilemost of us have been paying attention to how much easier technology has made our own lives-- sending e-mails back and forth on our blackberries, surfing the Web on our cell phones,instant messaging with friends across the world -- a quiet revolution has been breaking downbarriers and connecting the world   s economies. Now business not only has the ability to movejobs wherever there   s a factory, but wherever there   s an internet connection. Countries like India and China realized this. They understand that they no longer need to bejust a source of cheap labor or cheap exports. They can compete with us on a global scale.The one resource they needed were skilled, educated workers. So they started schooling theirkids earlier, longer, with a greater emphasis on math and science and technology, until theirmost talented students realized they don   t have to come to America to have a decent life --they can stay right where they are. The result? China is graduating four times the number of engineers that the United States isgraduating. Not only are those Maytag employees competing with Chinese and Indian andIndonesian and Mexican workers, you are too. Today, accounting firms are e-mailing your taxreturns to workers in India who will figure them out and send them back to you as fast as anyworker in Illinois or Indiana could. When you lose your luggage in Boston at an airport, tracking it down may involve a call to anagent in Bangalore, who will find it by making a phone call to Baltimore. Even the AssociatedPress has outsourced some of their jobs to writers all over the world who can send in a storyat a click of a mouse. As Prime Minister Tony Blair has said, in this new economy, ""Talent is the 21st centurywealth."" If you've got the skills, you've got the education, and you have the opportunity toupgrade and improve both, you   ll be able to compete and win anywhere. If not, the fall will befurther and harder than it ever was before. So what do we do about this? How does America find its way in this new, globaleconomy? What will our place in history be? Like so much of the American story, once again, we face a choice. Once again, there are thosewho believe that there isn   t much we can do about this as a nation. That the best idea is togive everyone one big refund on their government -- divvy it up by individual portions, in theform of tax breaks, hand it out, and encourage everyone to use their share to go buy theirown health care, their own retirement plan, their own child care, their own education, and soon. In Washington, they call this the Ownership Society. But in our past there has been anotherterm for it -- Social Darwinism -- every man or woman for him or herself. It   s a tempting idea,because it doesn   t require much thought or ingenuity. It allows us to say that those whosehealth care or tuition may rise faster than they can afford -- tough luck. It allows us to say tothe Maytag workers who have lost their job -- life isn   t fair. It let   s us say to the child who wasborn into poverty -- pull yourself up by your bootstraps. And it is especially tempting becauseeach of us believes we will always be the winner in life   s lottery, that we   re the one who will bethe next Donald Trump, or at least we won   t be the chump who Donald Trump says:    You   refired!    But there is a problem. It won   t work. It ignores our history. It ignores the fact that it   s beengovernment research and investment that made the railways possible and the internetpossible. It   s been the creation of a massive middle class, through decent wages and benefitsand public schools that allowed us all to prosper. Our economic dependence depended onindividual initiative. It depended on a belief in the free market; but it has also depended onour sense of mutual regard for each other, the idea that everybody has a stake in the country,that we   re all in it together and everybody   s got a shot at opportunity. That   s what   s producedour unrivaled political stability. And so if we do nothing in the face of globalization, more people will continue to lose theirhealth care. Fewer kids will be able to afford the diploma you   re about to receive. More companies like United Airlines won   t be able to provide pensions for their employees.And those Maytag workers will be joined in the unemployment line by any worker whose skillscan be bought and sold on the global market. So today I   m here to tell you what most of you already know. This is not us -- the option thatI just mentioned. Doing nothing. It   s not how our story ends -- not in this country. America isa land of big dreamers and big hopes. It is this hope that has sustained us through revolution and civil war, depression and worldwar, a struggle for civil and social rights and the brink of nuclear crisis. And it is because ourdreamers dreamed that we have emerged from each challenge more united, more prosperous,and more admired than before. So let   s dream. Instead of doing nothing or simply defending 20th century solutions, let   simagine together what we could do to give every American a fighting chance in the 21stcentury. What if we prepared every child in America with the education and skills they need to competein the new economy? If we made sure that college was affordable for everyone who wantedto go? If we walked up to those Maytag workers and we said    Your old job is not coming back,but a new job will be there because we   re going to seriously retrain you and there   s life-longeducation that   s waiting for you -- the sorts of opportunities that Knox has created with theStrong Futures scholarship program. What if no matter where you worked or how many times you switched jobs, you had healthcare and a pension that stayed with you always, so you all had the flexibility to move to abetter job or start a new business? What if instead of cutting budgets for research anddevelopment and science, we fueled the genius and the innovation that will lead to the newjobs and new industries of the future? Right now, all across America, there are amazing discoveries being made. If we supportedthese discoveries on a national level, if we committed ourselves to investing in thesepossibilities, just imagine what it could do for a town like Galesburg. Ten or twenty yearsdown the road, that old Maytag plant could re-open its doors as an Ethanol refinery thatturned corn into fuel. Down the street, a biotechnology research lab could open up on thecusp of discovering a cure for cancer. And across the way, a new auto company could be busychurning out electric cars. The new jobs created would be filled by American workers trainedwith new skills and a world-class education. All of that is possible but none of it will come easy. Every one of us is going to have to workmore, read more, train more, think more. We will have to slough off some bad habits -- likedriving gas guzzlers that weaken our economy and feed our enemies abroad. Our children willhave to turn off the TV set once in a while and put away the video games and start hitting thebooks. We   ll have to reform institutions, like our public schools, that were designed for anearlier time. Republicans will have to recognize our collective responsibilities, even asDemocrats recognize that we have to do more than just defend old programs. It won   t be easy, but it can be done. It can be our future. We have the talent and theresources and brainpower. But now we need the political will. We need a nationalcommitment. And we need each of you. Now, no one can force you to meet these challenges. If you want, it will be pretty easy for youto leave here today and not give another thought to towns like Galesburg and the challengesthey face. There is no community service requirement in the real world; no one is forcing youto care. You can take your diploma, walk off this stage, and go chasing after the big house, and thenice suits, and all the other things that our money culture says that you should want, that youshould aspire to, that you can buy. But I hope you don   t walk away from the challenge. Focusing your life solely on making a buckshows a certain poverty of ambition. It asks too little of yourself. You need to take up thechallenges that we face as a nation and make them your own. Not because you have a debt tothose who helped you get here, although you do have that debt. Not because you have anobligation to those who are less fortunate than you, although I do think you do have thatobligation. It   s primarily because you have an obligation to yourself. Because individualsalvation has always depended on collective salvation. Because it   s only when you hitch yourwagon to something larger than yourself that you realize your true potential. And I know that all of you are wondering how you   ll do this, the challenges seem so big. Theyseem so difficult for one person to make a difference. But we know it can be done. Because where you   re sitting, in this very place, in this town, it   shappened before. Nearly two centuries ago, before civil rights, before voting rights, before Abraham Lincoln,before the Civil War, before all of that, America was stained by the sin of slavery. In thesweltering heat of southern plantations, men and women who looked like me could not escapethe life of pain and servitude in which they were sold. And yet, year after year, as this moralcancer ate away at the American ideals of liberty and equality, the nation was silent. But its people didn   t stay silent for long. One by one, abolitionists emerged to tell their fellow Americans that this would not be ourplace in history -- that this was not the America that had captured the imagination of theworld. This resistance that they met was fierce, and some paid with their lives. But they would not bedeterred, and they soon spread out across the country to fight for their cause. One man fromNew York went west, all the way to the prairies of Illinois to start a colony. And here in Galesburg, freedom found a home. Here in Galesburg, the main depot for the Underground Railroad in Illinois, escaped slavescould roam freely on the streets and take shelter in people   s homes. And when their mastersor the police would come for them, the people of this town would help them escape north,some literally carrying them in their arms to freedom. Think about the risks that involved. If they were caught abetting a fugitive, you could   ve beenjailed or lynched. It would have been simple for these townspeople to turn the other way; togo live their lives in a private peace. And yet, they didn   t do that. Why? Because they knew that we were all Americans; that we were all brothers and sisters; thesame reason that a century later, young men and women your age would take Freedom Ridesdown south, to work for the Civil Rights movement. The same reason that black women wouldwalk instead of ride a bus after a long day of doing somebody else   s laundry and cleaningsomebody else   s kitchen. Because they were marching for freedom. Today, on this day of possibility, we stand in the shadow of a lanky, raw-boned man with littleformal education who once took the stage at Old Main and told the nation that if anyone didnot believe the American principles of freedom and equality, that those principles weretimeless and all-inclusive, they should go rip that page out of the Declaration ofIndependence. My hope for all of you is that as you leave here today, you decide to keep these principlesalive in your own life and in the life of this country. You will be tested. You won   t alwayssucceed. But know that you have it within your power to try. That generations who have comebefore you faced these same fears and uncertainties in their own time. And that through ourcollective labor, and through God   s providence, and our willingness to shoulder each other   sburdens, America will continue on its precious journey towards that distant horizon, and abetter day. Thank you so much class of 2005, and congratulations on your graduation. Thank you.",obama
"Thank you, Tim, for your hard work on this issue and on our economic recovery. The economic crisis we face is unlike any we've seen in our lifetime. It's a crisis of fallingconfidence and rising debt, of widely distributed risk and narrowly concentrated reward; acrisis written in the fine print of sub-prime mortgages, on the ledger lines of once mightyfinancial institutions, and on the pink slips that have upended the lives of so many peopleacross this country and cost the economy 2.6 million jobs last year alone.We know that even if we do everything that we should, this crisis was years in the making,and it will take more than weeks or months to turn things around.But make no mistake: A failure to act, and act now, will turn crisis into a catastrophe andguarantee a longer recession, a less robust recovery, and a more uncertain future. Millionsmore jobs will be lost. More businesses will be shuttered. More dreams will be deferred.And that's why I feel such a sense of urgency about the economic recovery and reinvestmentplan that is before Congress today. With it, we can save or create more than three millionjobs, doing things that will strengthen our country for years to come. It's not merely aprescription for short-term spending -- it's a strategy for long-term economic growth in areaslike renewable energy and health care and education.Now, in the past few days I've heard criticisms that this plan is somehow wanting, and thesecriticisms echo the very same failed economic theories that led us into this crisis in the firstplace -- the notion that tax cuts alone will solve all our problems; that we can ignorefundamental challenges like energy independence and the high cost of health care; that we can somehow deal with this in a piecemeal fashion and still expect our economy and ourcountry to thrive.I reject those theories. And so did the American people when they went to the polls inNovember and voted resoundingly for change. So I urge members of Congress to act withoutdelay. No plan is perfect, and we should work to make it stronger. No one is more committedto making it stronger than me. But let's not make the perfect the enemy of the essential. Let'sshow people all over the country who are looking for leadership in this difficult time that weare equal to the task.At the same time, we know that this recovery and reinvestment plan is only the first part ofwhat we need to do to restore prosperity and secure our future. We also need a strong andviable financial system to keep credit flowing to businesses and families alike. And myadministration will do whatever it takes to restore our financial system. Our recovery dependson it. And so in the next week, Secretary Geithner will release a new strategy to get creditmoving again -- a strategy that will reflect some of the lessons of past mistakes while layingthe foundation of the future.But in order to restore trust in our financial system, we're going to have to do more than justput forward our plans. In order to restore trust, we've got to make certain that taxpayer fundsare not subsidizing excessive compensation packages on Wall Street.We all need to take responsibility. And this includes executives at major financial firms whoturned to the American people, hat in hand, when they were in trouble, even as they paidthemselves customary lavish bonuses. As I said last week, this is the height of irresponsibility.It's shameful. And that's exactly the kind of disregard of the costs and consequences of theiractions that brought about this crisis: a culture of narrow self-interest and short-term gain atthe expense of everything else.This is America. We don't disparage wealth. We don't begrudge anybody for achievingsuccess. And we certainly believe that success should be rewarded. But what gets peopleupset -- and rightfully so -- are executives being rewarded for failure, especially when thoserewards are subsidized by U.S. taxpayers, many of whom are having a tough timethemselves.For top executives to award themselves these kinds of compensation packages in the midst ofthis economic crisis isn't just bad taste -- it's bad strategy -- and I will not tolerate it asPresident. We're going to be demanding some restraint in exchange for federal aid -- so thatwhen firms seek new federal dollars, we won't find them up to the same old tricks.As part of the reforms we're announcing today, top executives at firms receiving extraordinaryhelp from U.S. taxpayers will have their compensation capped at 500,000 dollars -- a fractionof the salaries that have been reported recently. And if these executives receive any additionalcompensation, it will come in the form of stock that can't be paid up until taxpayers are paidback for their assistance. Companies receiving federal aid are going to have to disclose publicly all the perks andluxuries bestowed upon senior executives, and provide an explanation to the taxpayers and toshareholders as to why these expenses are justified. And we're putting a stop to these kindsof massive severance packages we've all read about with disgust; we're taking the air out ofgolden parachutes.We're asking these firms to take responsibility, to recognize the nature of this crisis and theirrole in it. We believe that what we've laid out should be viewed as fair and embraced as basiccommon sense.And finally, these guidelines we're putting in place are only the beginning of a long-termeffort. We're going to examine the ways in which the means and manner of executivecompensation have contributed to a reckless culture and a quarter-by-quarter mentality thatin turn helped to wrought havoc in our financial system. We're going to be taking a look atbroader reforms so that executives are compensated for sound risk management, andrewarded for growth measured over years, not just days or weeks. We all have to pull together and take our share of responsibility. That's true here inWashington. That's true on Wall Street. The American people are carrying a huge burden as aresult of this economic crisis: bearing the brunt of its effects as well as the cost ofextraordinary measures we're taking to address them. The American people expect anddemand that we pursue policies that reflect the reality of this crisis -- and that will preventthese kinds of crises from occurring again in the future.Thank you very much.",obama
"Thank you so much. Thank you for this wonderful welcome. Thank you to the people of Prague. Thank youto the people of the Czech Republic. Today, I'm proud to stand here with you in the middle of this great city,in the center of Europe. And, to paraphrase one of my predecessors, I am also proud to be the man whobrought Michelle Obama to Prague.1 To Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, to all the dignitaries who are here, thank you for your extraordinaryhospitality. And to the people of the Czech Republic, thank you for your friendship to the United States. I've learned over many years to appreciate the good company and the good humor of the Czech people inmy hometown of Chicago. Behind me is a statue of a hero of the Czech people -- Tomas Masaryk. In 1918,after America had pledged its support for Czech independence, Masaryk spoke to a crowd in Chicago thatwas estimated to be over 100,000. I don't think I can match his record -- but I am honored to follow hisfootsteps from Chicago to Prague. For over a thousand years, Prague has set itself apart from any other city in any other place. You've knownwar and peace. You've seen empires rise and fall. You've led revolutions in the arts and science, in politicsand in poetry. Through it all, the people of Prague have insisted on pursuing their own path, and definingtheir own destiny. And this city -- this Golden City which is both ancient and youthful -- stands as a livingmonument to your unconquerable spirit. When I was born, the world was divided, and our nations were faced with very different circumstances. Fewpeople would have predicted that someone like me would one day become the President of the UnitedStates. Few people would have predicted that an American President would one day be permitted to speakto an audience like this in Prague. Few would have imagined that the Czech Republic would become a freenation, a member of NATO, a leader of a united Europe. Those ideas would have been dismissed asdreams. We are here today because enough people ignored the voices who told them that the world could notchange. We're here today because of the courage of those who stood up and took risks to say that freedom is a rightfor all people, no matter what side of a wall they live on, and no matter what they look like. We are here today because of the Prague Spring -- because the simple and principled pursuit of liberty andopportunity shamed those who relied on the power of tanks and arms to put down the will of a people. We are here today because 20 years ago, the people of this city took to the streets to claim the promise of anew day, and the fundamental human rights that had been denied them for far too long. Sametov   Revoluce-- the Velvet Revolution taught us many things. It showed us that peaceful protest could shake thefoundations of an empire, and expose the emptiness of an ideology. It showed us that small countries canplay a pivotal role in world events, and that young people can lead the way in overcoming old conflicts. Andit proved that moral leadership is more powerful than any weapon. That's why I'm speaking to you in the center of a Europe that is peaceful, united and free -- becauseordinary people believed that divisions could be bridged, even when their leaders did not. They believed thatwalls could come down; that peace could prevail. We are here today because Americans and Czechs believed against all odds that today could be possible. Now, we share this common history. But now this generation -- our generation -- cannot stand still. We, too,have a choice to make. As the world has become less divided, it has become more interconnected. Andwe've seen events move faster than our ability to control them -- a global economy in crisis, a changingclimate, the persistent dangers of old conflicts, new threats and the spread of catastrophic weapons. None of these challenges can be solved quickly or easily. But all of them demand that we listen to oneanother and work together; that we focus on our common interests, not on occasional differences; and thatwe reaffirm our shared values, which are stronger than any force that could drive us apart. That is the workthat we must carry on. That is the work that I have come to Europe to begin. To renew our prosperity, we need action coordinated across borders. That means investments to createnew jobs. That means resisting the walls of protectionism that stand in the way of growth. That means achange in our financial system, with new rules to prevent abuse and future crisis. And we have an obligation to our common prosperity and our common humanity to extend a hand to thoseemerging markets and impoverished people who are suffering the most, even though they may have hadvery little to do with financial crises, which is why we set aside over a trillion dollars for the InternationalMonetary Fund earlier this week, to make sure that everybody -- everybody -- receives some assistance. Now, to protect our planet, now is the time to change the way that we use energy. Together, we mustconfront climate change by ending the world's dependence on fossil fuels, by tapping the power of newsources of energy like the wind and sun, and calling upon all nations to do their part. And I pledge to youthat in this global effort, the United States is now ready to lead. To provide for our common security, we must strengthen our alliance. NATO was founded 60 years ago,after Communism took over Czechoslovakia. That was when the free world learned too late that it could notafford division. So we came together to forge the strongest alliance that the world has ever known. And weshould -- stood shoulder to shoulder -- year after year, decade after decade -- until an Iron Curtain waslifted, and freedom spread like flowing water. This marks the 10th year of NATO membership for the Czech Republic. And I know that many times in the20th century, decisions were made without you at the table. Great powers let you down, or determined yourdestiny without your voice being heard. I am here to say that the United States will never turn its back on thepeople of this nation. We are bound by shared values, shared history -- We are bound by shared values andshared history and the enduring promise of our alliance. NATO's Article V states it clearly: An attack on oneis an attack on all. That is a promise for our time, and for all time. The people of the Czech Republic kept that promise after America was attacked; thousands were killed onour soil, and NATO responded. NATO's mission in Afghanistan is fundamental to the safety of people onboth sides of the Atlantic. We are targeting the same al Qaeda terrorists who have struck from New York toLondon, and helping the Afghan people take responsibility for their future. We are demonstrating that freenations can make common cause on behalf of our common security. And I want you to know that we honorthe sacrifices of the Czech people in this endeavor, and mourn the loss of those you've lost. But no alliance can afford to stand still. We must work together as NATO members so that we havecontingency plans in place to deal with new threats, wherever they may come from. We must strengthen ourcooperation with one another, and with other nations and institutions around the world, to confront dangersthat recognize no borders. And we must pursue constructive relations with Russia on issues of commonconcern. Now, one of those issues that I'll focus on today is fundamental to the security of our nations and to thepeace of the world -- that's the future of nuclear weapons in the 21st century. The existence of thousands of nuclear weapons is the most dangerous legacy of the Cold War. No nuclearwar was fought between the United States and the Soviet Union, but generations lived with the knowledgethat their world could be erased in a single flash of light. Cities like Prague that existed for centuries, thatembodied the beauty and the talent of so much of humanity, would have ceased to exist. Today, the Cold War has disappeared but thousands of those weapons have not. In a strange turn ofhistory, the threat of global nuclear war has gone down, but the risk of a nuclear attack has gone up. Morenations have acquired these weapons. Testing has continued. Black market trade in nuclear secrets andnuclear materials abound. The technology to build a bomb has spread. Terrorists are determined to buy,build or steal one. Our efforts to contain these dangers are centered on a global non-proliferation regime,but as more people and nations break the rules, we could reach the point where the center cannot hold. Now, understand, this matters to people everywhere. One nuclear weapon exploded in one city -- be it NewYork or Moscow, Islamabad or Mumbai, Tokyo or Tel Aviv, Paris or Prague -- could kill hundreds ofthousands of people. And no matter where it happens, there is no end to what the consequences might be --for our global safety, our security, our society, our economy, to our ultimate survival. Some argue that the spread of these weapons cannot be stopped, cannot be checked -- that we aredestined to live in a world where more nations and more people possess the ultimate tools of destruction.Such fatalism is a deadly adversary, for if we believe that the spread of nuclear weapons is inevitable, thenin some way we are admitting to ourselves that the use of nuclear weapons is inevitable. Just as we stood for freedom in the 20th century, we must stand together for the right of people everywhereto live free from fear in the 21st century. And as nuclear power -- as a nuclear power, as the only nuclearpower to have used a nuclear weapon, the United States has a moral responsibility to act. We cannotsucceed in this endeavor alone, but we can lead it, we can start it. So today, I state clearly and with conviction America's commitment to seek the peace and security of aworld without nuclear weapons. I'm not naive. This goal will not be reached quickly -- perhaps not in mylifetime. It will take patience and persistence. But now we, too, must ignore the voices who tell us that theworld cannot change. We have to insist, ""Yes, we can."" Now, let me describe to you the trajectory we need to be on. First, the United States will take concrete stepstowards a world without nuclear weapons. To put an end to Cold War thinking, we will reduce the role ofnuclear weapons in our national security strategy, and urge others to do the same. Make no mistake: Aslong as these weapons exist, the United States will maintain a safe, secure and effective arsenal to deterany adversary, and guarantee that defense to our allies -- including the Czech Republic. But we will beginthe work of reducing our arsenal. To reduce our warheads and stockpiles, we will negotiate a new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with theRussians this year. President Medvedev and I began this process in London, and will seek a newagreement by the end of this year that is legally binding and sufficiently bold. And this will set the stage forfurther cuts, and we will seek to include all nuclear weapons states in this endeavor. To achieve a global ban on nuclear testing, my administration will immediately and aggressively pursue U.S.ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. After more than five decades of talks, it is time for thetesting of nuclear weapons to finally be banned. And to cut off the building blocks needed for a bomb, the United States will seek a new treaty that verifiablyends the production of fissile materials intended for use in state nuclear weapons. If we are serious aboutstopping the spread of these weapons, then we should put an end to the dedicated production of weapons- grade materials that create them. That's the first step. Second, together we will strengthen the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as a basis for cooperation. The basic bargain is sound: Countries with nuclear weapons will move towards disarmament, countrieswithout nuclear weapons will not acquire them, and all countries can access peaceful nuclear energy. Tostrengthen the treaty, we should embrace several principles. We need more resources and authority tostrengthen international inspections. We need real and immediate consequences for countries caughtbreaking the rules or trying to leave the treaty without cause. And we should build a new framework for civil nuclear cooperation, including an international fuel bank, sothat countries can access peaceful power without increasing the risks of proliferation. That must be the rightof every nation that renounces nuclear weapons, especially developing countries embarking on peacefulprograms. And no approach will succeed if it's based on the denial of rights to nations that play by the rules.We must harness the power of nuclear energy on behalf of our efforts to combat climate change, and toadvance peace opportunity for all people. But we go forward with no illusions. Some countries will break the rules. That's why we need a structure inplace that ensures when any nation does, they will face consequences. Just this morning, we were reminded again of why we need a new and more rigorous approach to addressthis threat. North Korea broke the rules once again by testing a rocket that could be used for long rangemissiles. This provocation underscores the need for action -- not just this afternoon at the U.N. SecurityCouncil, but in our determination to prevent the spread of these weapons. Rules must be binding. Violations must be punished. Words must mean something. The world must standtogether to prevent the spread of these weapons. Now is the time for a strong international response -- nowis the time for a strong international response, and North Korea must know that the path to security andrespect will never come through threats and illegal weapons. All nations must come together to build astronger, global regime. And that's why we must stand shoulder to shoulder to pressure the North Koreansto change course. Iran has yet to build a nuclear weapon. My administration will seek engagement with Iran based on mutualinterests and mutual respect. We believe in dialogue. But in that dialogue we will present a clear choice. Wewant Iran to take its rightful place in the community of nations, politically and economically. We will supportIran's right to peaceful nuclear energy with rigorous inspections. That's a path that the Islamic Republic cantake. Or the government can choose increased isolation, international pressure, and a potential nucleararms race in the region that will increase insecurity for all. So let me be clear: Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile activity poses a real threat, not just to the UnitedStates, but to Iran's neighbors and our allies. The Czech Republic and Poland have been courageous inagreeing to host a defense against these missiles. As long as the threat from Iran persists, we will goforward with a missile defense system that is cost-effective and proven. If the Iranian threat is eliminated, wewill have a stronger basis for security, and the driving force for missile defense construction in Europe willbe removed. So, finally, we must ensure that terrorists never acquire a nuclear weapon. This is the most immediate andextreme threat to global security. One terrorist with one nuclear weapon could unleash massive destruction.Al Qaeda has said it seeks a bomb and that it would have no problem with using it. And we know that thereis unsecured nuclear material across the globe. To protect our people, we must act with a sense of purposewithout delay. So today I am announcing a new international effort to secure all vulnerable nuclear material around theworld within four years. We will set new standards, expand our cooperation with Russia, pursue newpartnerships to lock down these sensitive materials. We must also build on our efforts to break up black markets, detect and intercept materials in transit, anduse financial tools to disrupt this dangerous trade. Because this threat will be lasting, we should cometogether to turn efforts such as the Proliferation Security Initiative and the Global Initiative to CombatNuclear Terrorism into durable international institutions. And we should start by having a Global Summit onNuclear Security that the United States will host within the next year. Now, I know that there are some who will question whether we can act on such a broad agenda. There arethose who doubt whether true international cooperation is possible, given inevitable differences amongnations. And there are those who hear talk of a world without nuclear weapons and doubt whether it's worthsetting a goal that seems impossible to achieve. But make no mistake: We know where that road leads. When nations and peoples allow themselves to bedefined by their differences, the gulf between them widens. When we fail to pursue peace, then it staysforever beyond our grasp. We know the path when we choose fear over hope. To denounce or shrug off acall for cooperation is an easy but also a cowardly thing to do. That's how wars begin. That's where humanprogress ends. There is violence and injustice in our world that must be confronted. We must confront it not by splittingapart but by standing together as free nations, as free people. I know that a call to arms can stir the souls ofmen and women more than a call to lay them down. But that is why the voices for peace and progress mustbe raised together. Those are the voices that still echo through the streets of Prague. Those are the ghosts of 1968. Thosewere the joyful sounds of the Velvet Revolution. Those were the Czechs who helped bring down a nuclear- armed empire without firing a shot. Human destiny will be what we make of it. And here in Prague, let us honor our past by reaching for a betterfuture. Let us bridge our divisions, build upon our hopes, accept our responsibility to leave this world moreprosperous and more peaceful than we found it. Together we can do it. Thank you very much. Thank you, Prague. 1 Reference to President John F. Kennedy's remark -- upon observing the overwhelmingly positive reception given his wife upon their first visit to France --as ""the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris.""",obama
"Mr. Speaker, Madam Deputy Speaker, distinguished members, I am honored to speak in this chamber, andI am committed to renewing the alliance between our nations and the friendship between our people. This is my first trip overseas as President of the United States. I've been to the G20 summit in London, andthe NATO summit in Strasbourg, and the European Union summit in Prague. Some people have asked meif I chose to continue my travels to Ankara and Istanbul to send a message to the world. And my answer issimple: Evet -- yes. Turkey is a critical ally. Turkey is an important part of Europe. And Turkey and theUnited States must stand together -- and work together -- to overcome the challenges of our time. This morning I had the great privilege of visiting the tomb of your extraordinary founder of your republic. AndI was deeply impressed by this beautiful memorial to a man who did so much to shape the course of history.But it is also clear that the greatest monument to Ataturk's life is not something that can be cast in stone andmarble. His greatest legacy is Turkey's strong, vibrant, secular democracy, and that is the work that thisassembly carries on today. This future was not easily assured, it was not guaranteed. At the end of World War I, Turkey could havesuccumbed to the foreign powers that were trying to claim its territory, or sought to restore an ancientempire. But Turkey chose a different future. You freed yourself from foreign control, and you founded arepublic that commands the respect of the United States and the wider world. And there is a simple truth to this story: Turkey's democracy is your own achievement. It was not forcedupon you by any outside power, nor did it come without struggle and sacrifice. Turkey draws strength fromboth the successes of the past, and from the efforts of each generation of Turks that makes new progressfor your people. Now, my country's democracy has its own story. The general who led America in revolution and governedas our first President was, as many of you know, George Washington. And like you, we built a grandmonument to honor our founding father -- a towering obelisk that stands in the heart of the capital city thatbears Washington's name. I can see the Washington Monument from the window of the White House everyday. It took decades to build. There were frequent delays. Over time, more and more people contributed to helpmake this monument the inspiring structure that still stands tall today. Among those who came to our aidwere friends from all across the world who offered their own tributes to Washington and the country hehelped to found. And one of those tributes came from Istanbul. Ottoman Sultan Abdulmecid sent a marble plaque that helpedto build the Washington Monument. Inscribed in the plaque was a poem that began with a few simple words:""So as to strengthen the friendship between the two countries."" Over 150 years have passed since thosewords were carved into marble. Our nations have changed in many ways. But our friendship is strong, andour alliance endures. It is a friendship that flourished in the years after World War II, when President Truman committed ournation to the defense of Turkey's freedom and sovereignty, and Turkey committed itself into the NATOAlliance. Turkish troops have served by our side from Korea to Kosovo to Kabul. Together, we withstood thegreat test of the Cold War. Trade between our nations has steadily advanced. So has cooperation inscience and research. The ties among our people have deepened, as well, and more and more Americans of Turkish origin liveand work and succeed within our borders. And as a basketball fan, I've even noticed that Hedo Turkogluand Mehmet Okur have got some pretty good basketball games. The United States and Turkey have not always agreed on every issue, and that's to be expected -- no twonations do. But we have stood together through many challenges over the last 60 years. And because of thestrength of our alliance and the endurance of our friendship, both America and Turkey are stronger and theworld is more secure. Now, our two democracies are confronted by an unprecedented set of challenges: An economic crisis thatrecognizes no borders; extremism that leads to the killing of innocent men and women and children; strainson our energy supply and a changing climate; the proliferation of the world's deadliest weapons; and thepersistence of tragic conflict. These are the great tests of our young century. And the choices that we make in the coming years willdetermine whether the future will be shaped by fear or by freedom; by poverty or by prosperity; by strife orby a just, secure and lasting peace. This much is certain: No one nation can confront these challenges alone, and all nations have a stake inovercoming them. That is why we must listen to one another, and seek common ground. That is why wemust build on our mutual interests, and rise above our differences. We are stronger when we act together. That is the message that I've carried with me throughout this trip to Europe. That is the message that Idelivered when I had the privilege of meeting with your President and with your Prime Minister. That will bethe approach of the United States of America going forward. Already, America and Turkey are working with the G20 on an unprecedented response to an unprecedentedeconomic crisis. Now, this past week, we came together to ensure that the world's largest economies takestrong and coordinated action to stimulate growth and restore the flow of credit; to reject the pressures ofprotectionism, and to extend a hand to developing countries and the people hit hardest by this downturn;and to dramatically reform our regulatory system so that the world never faces a crisis like this again. As we go forward, the United States and Turkey can pursue many opportunities to serve prosperity for ourpeople. The President and I this morning talked about expanding the ties of commerce and trade. There'senormous opportunity when it comes to energy to create jobs. And we can increase new sources to not onlyfree ourselves from dependence of other energies -- other countries' energy sources, but also to combatclimate change. We should build on our Clean Technology Fund to leverage efficiency and renewableenergy investments in Turkey. And to power markets in Turkey and Europe, the United States will continueto support your central role as an East-West corridor for oil and natural gas. This economic cooperation only reinforces the common security that Europe and the United States sharewith Turkey as a NATO ally, and the common values that we share as democracies. So in meeting thechallenges of the 21st century, we must seek the strength of a Europe that is truly united, peaceful and free. So let me be clear: The United States strongly supports Turkey's bid to become a member of the EuropeanUnion. We speak not as members of the EU, but as close friends of both Turkey and Europe. Turkey hasbeen a resolute ally and a responsible partner in transatlantic and European institutions. Turkey is bound toEurope by more than the bridges over the Bosphorous. Centuries of shared history, culture, and commercebring you together. Europe gains by the diversity of ethnicity, tradition and faith -- it is not diminished by it.And Turkish membership would broaden and strengthen Europe's foundation once more. Now, of course, Turkey has its own responsibilities. And you've made important progress towardsmembership. But I also know that Turkey has pursued difficult political reforms not simply because it's goodfor EU membership, but because it's right for Turkey. In the last several years, you've abolished state security courts, you've expanded the right to counsel.You've reformed the penal code and strengthened laws that govern the freedom of the press and assembly.You've lifted bans on teaching and broadcasting Kurdish, and the world noted with respect the importantsignal sent through a new state Kurdish television station. These achievements have created new laws that must be implemented, and a momentum that should besustained. For democracies cannot be static -- they must move forward. Freedom of religion and expressionlead to a strong and vibrant civil society that only strengthens the state, which is why steps like reopeningHalki Seminary will send such an important signal inside Turkey and beyond. An enduring commitment tothe rule of law is the only way to achieve the security that comes from justice for all people. Robust minorityrights let societies benefit from the full measure of contributions from all citizens. I say this as the President of a country that not very long ago made it hard for somebody who looks like meto vote, much less be President of the United States. But it is precisely that capacity to change that enrichesour countries. Every challenge that we face is more easily met if we tend to our own democratic foundation.This work is never over. That's why, in the United States, we recently ordered the prison at GuantanamoBay closed. That's why we prohibited -- without exception or equivocation -- the use of torture. All of us haveto change. And sometimes change is hard. Another issue that confronts all democracies as they move to the future is how we deal with the past. TheUnited States is still working through some of our own darker periods in our history. Facing the WashingtonMonument that I spoke of is a memorial of Abraham Lincoln, the man who freed those who were enslavedeven after Washington led our Revolution. Our country still struggles with the legacies of slavery andsegregation, the past treatment of Native Americans. Human endeavor is by its nature imperfect. History is often tragic, but unresolved, it can be a heavy weight.Each country must work through its past. And reckoning with the past can help us seize a better future. Iknow there's strong views in this chamber about the terrible events of 1915. And while there's been a gooddeal of commentary about my views, it's really about how the Turkish and Armenian people deal with thepast. And the best way forward for the Turkish and Armenian people is a process that works through thepast in a way that is honest, open and constructive. We've already seen historic and courageous steps taken by Turkish and Armenian leaders. These contactshold out the promise of a new day. An open border would return the Turkish and Armenian people to apeaceful and prosperous coexistence that would serve both of your nations. So I want you to know that theUnited States strongly supports the full normalization of relations between Turkey and Armenia. It is a causeworth working towards. It speaks to Turkey's leadership that you are poised to be the only country in the region to have normal andpeaceful relations with all the South Caucasus nations. And to advance that peace, you can play aconstructive role in helping to resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, which has continued for far too long. Advancing peace also includes the disputes that persist in the Eastern Mediterranean. And here there's acause for hope. The two Cypriot leaders have an opportunity through their commitment to negotiationsunder the United Nations Good Offices Mission. The United States is willing to offer all the help sought bythe parties as they work towards a just and lasting settlement that reunifies Cyprus into a bizonal andbicommunal federation. These efforts speak to one part of the critical region that surrounds Turkey. And when we consider thechallenges before us, on issue after issue, we share common goals. In the Middle East, we share the goalof a lasting peace between Israel and its neighbors. Let me be clear: The United States strongly supportsthe goal of two states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security. That is a goal sharedby Palestinians, Israelis, and people of goodwill around the world. That is a goal that the parties agreed to inthe road map and at Annapolis. That is a goal that I will actively pursue as President of the United States. We know the road ahead will be difficult. Both Israelis and Palestinians must take steps that are necessaryto build confidence and trust. Both Israelis and Palestinians, both must live up to the commitments they have made. Both must overcomelongstanding passions and the politics of the moment to make progress towards a secure and lasting peace. The United States and Turkey can help the Palestinians and Israelis make this journey. Like the UnitedStates, Turkey has been a friend and partner in Israel's quest for security. And like the United States, youseek a future of opportunity and statehood for the Palestinians. So now, working together, we must not giveinto pessimism and mistrust. We must pursue every opportunity for progress, as you've done by supportingnegotiations between Syria and Israel. We must extend a hand to those Palestinians who are in need, whilehelping them strengthen their own institutions. We must reject the use of terror, and recognize that Israel'ssecurity concerns are legitimate. The peace of the region will also be advanced if Iran forgoes any nuclear weapons ambitions. Now, as Imade clear in Prague yesterday, no one is served by the spread of nuclear weapons, least of all Turkey.You live in a difficult region and a nuclear arm race would not serve the security of this nation well. This partof the world has known enough violence. It has known enough hatred. It does not need a race for an ever- more powerful tool of destruction. Now, I have made it clear to the people and leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran that the United Statesseeks engagement based on mutual interest and mutual respect. We want Iran to play its rightful role in thecommunity of nations. Iran is a great civilization. We want them to engage in the economic and politicalintegration that brings prosperity and security. But Iran's leaders must choose whether they will try to build aweapon or build a better future for their people. So both Turkey and the United States support a secure and united Iraq that does not serve as a safe havenfor terrorists. I know there were differences about whether to go to war. There were differences within myown country, as well. But now we must come together as we end this war responsibly, because the future ofIraq is inseparable from the future of the broader region. As I've already announced, and many of you areaware, the United States will remove our combat brigades by the end of next August, while working with theIraqi government as they take responsibility for security. And we will work with Iraq, Turkey, and all Iraq'sneighbors, to forge a new dialogue that reconciles differences and advances our common security. Make no mistake, though: Iraq, Turkey, and the United States face a common threat from terrorism. Thatincludes the al Qaeda terrorists who have sought to drive Iraqis apart and destroy their country. Thatincludes the PKK. There is no excuse for terror against any nation. As President, and as a NATO ally, Ipledge that you will have our support against the terrorist activities of the PKK or anyone else. These effortswill be strengthened by the continued work to build ties of cooperation between Turkey, the Iraqigovernment, and Iraq's Kurdish leaders, and by your continued efforts to promote education and opportunityand democracy for the Kurdish population here inside Turkey. Finally, we share the common goal of denying al Qaeda a safe haven in Pakistan or Afghanistan. The worldhas come too far to let this region backslide, and to let al Qaeda terrorists plot further attacks. That's why weare committed to a more focused effort to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda. That is why we areincreasing our efforts to train Afghans to sustain their own security, and to reconcile former adversaries.That's why we are increasing our support for the people of Afghanistan and Pakistan, so that we stand onthe side not only of security, but also of opportunity and the promise of a better life. Turkey has been a true partner. Your troops were among the first in the International Security AssistanceForce. You have sacrificed much in this endeavor. Now we must achieve our goals together. I appreciatethat you've offered to help us train and support Afghan security forces, and expand opportunity across theregion. Together, we can rise to meet this challenge like we have so many before. I know there have been difficulties these last few years. I know that the trust that binds the United Statesand Turkey has been strained, and I know that strain is shared in many places where the Muslim faith ispracticed. So let me say this as clearly as I can: The United States is not, and will never be, at war withIslam. In fact, our partnership with the Muslim world is critical not just in rolling back the violent ideologiesthat people of all faiths reject, but also to strengthen opportunity for all its people. I also want to be clear that America's relationship with the Muslim community, the Muslim world, cannot, andwill not, just be based upon opposition to terrorism. We seek broader engagement based on mutual interestand mutual respect. We will listen carefully, we will bridge misunderstandings, and we will seek commonground. We will be respectful, even when we do not agree. We will convey our deep appreciation for theIslamic faith, which has done so much over the centuries to shape the world -- including in my own country.The United States has been enriched by Muslim Americans. Many other Americans have Muslims in theirfamilies or have lived in a Muslim-majority country. I know, because I am one of them. Above all, above all we will demonstrate through actions our commitment to a better future. I want to helpmore children get the education that they need to succeed. We want to promote health care in places wherepeople are vulnerable. We want to expand the trade and investment that can bring prosperity for all people.In the months ahead, I will present specific programs to advance these goals. Our focus will be on what wecan do, in partnership with people across the Muslim world, to advance our common hopes and ourcommon dreams. And when people look back on this time, let it be said of America that we extended thehand of friendship to all people. There's an old Turkish proverb: ""You cannot put out fire with flames."" America knows this. Turkey knowsthis. There's some who must be met by force, they will not compromise. But force alone cannot solve ourproblems, and it is no alternative to extremism. The future must belong to those who create, not those whodestroy. That is the future we must work for, and we must work for it together. I know there are those who like to debate Turkey's future. They see your country at the crossroads ofcontinents, and touched by the currents of history. They know that this has been a place where civilizationsmeet, and different peoples come together. They wonder whether you will be pulled in one direction oranother. But I believe here is what they don't understand: Turkey's greatness lies in your ability to be at the center ofthings. This is not where East and West divide -- this is where they come together. In the beauty of yourculture. In the richness of your history. In the strength of your democracy. In your hopes for tomorrow. I amhonored to stand here with you -- to look forward to the future that we must reach for together -- and toreaffirm America's commitment to our strong and enduring friendship. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.",obama
"Thank you very much, Mr. President. You know, four years ago, following the most devastating attack in our history, this Bodypassed the USA PATRIOT Act in order to give our Nation's law enforcement the tools theyneeded to track down terrorists who plot and lurk within our own borders and all over theworld; terrorists who, right now, are looking to exploit weaknesses in our laws and oursecurity to carry out attacks that may be even deadlier than those that took place onSeptember 11th. We all agree that we need legislation to make it harder for suspected terrorists to goundetected in this country. And we all agree that we needed to make it harder for them toorganize and strategize and get flight licenses and sneak across our borders. Americanseverywhere wanted to do that. But soon after the PATRIOT Act passed, a few years before I even arrived here in the Senate,I began hearing concerns from people of every background and political leaning that this law,the very purpose of which was to protect us, was also threatening to violate some of therights and freedoms that we hold most dear; that it didn't just provide law enforcement thepowers it needed to keep us safe but powers that it didn't need to invade our privacy withoutcause or suspicion. Now, in Washington, this issue has tended to degenerate into the typical either/or debate:Either we protect our people from terror or we protect our most cherished principles. I wouldsuggest, Mr. President, that this is a false choice. It asks too little of us and it assumes toolittle about America. That's why, as it's come to time to reauthorize the USA PATRIOT Act, we've been working in abipartisan way to do both -- to show American people that we can track down terroristswithout trampling on our civil liberties, to show the American people that the FederalGovernment will only issue warrants and execute searches because it needs to do so, notbecause it can do so. What we have been trying to achieve under the leadership of a bipartisan group of Senators issome accountability in this process to get answers and see evidence where there is suspicion. Several weeks ago, these efforts bore fruit. The Judiciary Committee and the U.S. -- U.S.Senate managed to pass a piece of bipartisan legislation that, while I can't say is perfect, wasable to address some of the most serious problems in the existing law. Unfortunately, that strong bipartisan legislation has been tossed aside in conference. Instead,we've been forced to consider a piece of rushed legislation that fails to address the concernsof Members of both parties as well as the American people. This is legislation that puts our own Justice Department above the law. When national securityletters are issued, they allow Federal agents to conduct any search on any American, nomatter how extensive, how wide ranging, without ever going before a judge to prove that thesearch is necessary. All that is needed is a signoff from a local FBI agent. That's it. Once a business or a person receives notification that they will be searched, they areprohibited from telling anyone about it and they're even prohibited from challenging thisautomatic gag order in court. Even though judges have already found that similar restrictionsviolate the first amendment, this conference report disregards the case law and the right tochallenge the gag order. If you do decide to consult an attorney for legal advice, hold on. You will have to tell the FBIthat you've done so. Think about that: You want to talk to a lawyer about whether or not youractions are going to be causing you to get into trouble, you've got to tell the FBI that you'reconsulting a lawyer. This is unheard of. There is no such requirement in any other area of thelaw. I see no reason why it's justified here. And if someone wants to know why their own Government has decided to go on a fishingexpedition through every personal record or private document, through the library books thatyou read, the phone calls that you've made, the e-mails that you've sent, this legislation givespeople no rights to appeal the need for such a search in a court of law. No judge will hear your plea; no jury will hear your case. This is just plain wrong. And thereare Republican Senators as well as Democratic Senators that recognize that it's plain wrong. Giving law enforcement the tools they need to investigate suspicious activities is one thingand it's the right thing; but doing it without any real oversight seriously jeopardizes the rightsof all Americans and the ideals America stands for. Now, supporters of this conference report have argued we should just hold our noses andsupport this legislation because it's not going to get any better. That is not a good argument.We can do better. We've got time to do better. It doesn't convince me that I should supportthis report. I believe we owe it to the Nation, we owe it to those who fought for our civilliberties, we owe it to the future and our children to make sure that we craft the kind oflegislation that would make us proud, not just legislation that we would settle for becausewe're in a rush. We don't have to settle for a PATRIOT Act that sacrifices our liberties or oursafety. We can have one that secures both. Now, there have been proposals on both sides of the aisle and in both Houses of Congress toextend the PATRIOT Act for three months so that we can reach an agreement on this bill thatis well thought through. I support these efforts and will oppose cloture on what I consider tobe this unacceptable conference report. Mr. President, I thank you. I yield the floor....",obama
"Thank you. Thank you, guys. Let me say Multinational Force Iraq, Multinational Corps Iraq,Multinational Security Transition Command Iraq First Corps, America's Corp Band: Thanks toall of you. Listen, I am so honored. Audience Member: We love you. President Obama: I love you back. I am honored -- I'm honored and grateful to be with all ofyou. And I'm not going to talk long because I want to shake as many hands as I can. And I'vebeen talking all week. But there's a couple of things I want to say. Number one, thank you. You know, when I was at Camp Lejeune I spoke about what it means for America to see ourbest and brightest, our finest young men and women serve us. And what I said then issomething that I want to repeat to you, which is: You have performed brilliantly in everymission that has been given to you. Under enormous strain and under enormous sacrifice, through controversy and difficulty andpolitics, you've kept your eyes focused on just doing your job. And because of that, everymission that's been assigned -- from getting rid of Saddam, to reducing violence, to stabilizingthe country, to facilitating elections -- you have given Iraq the opportunity to stand on its ownas a democratic country. That is an extraordinary achievement, and for that you have thethanks of the American people. That's point number one. Point number two is, this is going to be a critical period, these next 18 months. I was justdiscussing this with your commander, but I think it's something that all of you know. It istime for us to transition to the Iraqis. They need to take responsibility for their country and fortheir sovereignty. And in order for them to do that, they have got to make political accommodations. They'regoing to have to decide that they want to resolve their differences through constitutionalmeans and legal means. They are going to have to focus on providing government servicesthat encourage confidence among their citizens. All those things they have to do. We can't do it for them. But what we can do is make surethat we are a stalwart partner, that we are working alongside them, that we are committed totheir success, that in terms of training their security forces, training their civilian forces inorder to achieve a more effective government, they know that they have a steady partnerwith us. And so just as we thank you for what you've already accomplished, I want to say thank youbecause you will be critical in terms of us being able to make sure that Iraq is stable, that it isnot a safe haven for terrorists, that it is a good neighbor and a good ally, and we can startbringing our folks home. So now is not the time to lose focus. We have to be even morefocused than we've been in order to achieve success. The last point I want to make is I know how hard it's been on a lot of you. You've been awayfrom your families, many of you for multiple rotations. You've seen buddies of yours injuredand you remember those who have made the ultimate sacrifice. There are probably some people here who have seen children born and have been missingwatching them grow up. There are many of you who have listened to your spouse and theextraordinary sacrifices that they have to make when you're gone. And so I want you to know that Michelle and myself are doing everything -- are doingeverything we can to provide additional support for military families. The federal budget that Ihave introduced increases support for military families. We are going to do everythingrequired to make sure that the commitment we make to our veterans is met, and that peopledon't have to fight for what they have earned as a consequence of their service. The main point I want to make is we have not forgotten what you have already done, we aregrateful for what you will do, and as long as I am in the White House, you are going to get thesupport that you need and the thanks that you deserve from a grateful nation. So thank you very much everybody. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.",obama
"Thank you for the extraordinary welcome. And thanks for those of you who prepared, from the CIA gift shop, the t-shirts, the caps, the water bottles. Michelle and the girls willappreciate that very much. It is a great honor to be here with the men and women of the CIA. I   ve been eager to come out here to Langley for some time so I can deliver a simple message to you in person on behalf of the American people: Thank you. Thank you for all the work that you do to protectthe American people and the freedom that we all cherish. The CIA is fundamental to America   s national security. And I want you to know that that   s why I nominated such an outstanding public servant and close friend, Leon Panetta, to lead -- to lead the agency. He is one of our nation   s finest public servants. He has my complete confidence. And he is a strong voice in my national security team, as well as a strongadvocate for the men and women of the CIA. I also benefit from the counsel of several agency veterans -- chief among them, SteveKappes, who   s stayed on to serve as Leon   s deputy. He   s -- and he   s done outstanding work. I have to add, just as an aside, by the way, I just met with a smaller group of about 50, so we could have a dialogue. And all of you look really young. And so to have a graybeard literallyand figuratively like Steve Kappes here, I think, is absolutely critical. I also want you to know that we have one of your own, John Brennan, who is doing a terrific job as my adviser for counterterrorism and homeland security. And we are very grateful for the work that he does and the insights that he brings, from his long years of service here atthe CIA. And I would be remiss if I didn   t mention the extraordinary former CIA officer and Director of Central Intelligence, Bob Gates, who is also part of our Cabinet and every once in a whilegives me a few tips. So let me share with you just a few thoughts about the situation in which we find ourselves. First, I want to underscore the importance of the CIA. When the CIA was founded, you were focused on one overarching threat, the Soviet Union. And for decades, the CIA carried out a critically important mission. And with the end of the Cold War, some wondered how importantthe CIA would be to our future. Now we know. Here in the 21st century, we   ve learned that the CIA is more important than ever. For as Leon mentioned, we face a wide range of unconventional challenges: stateless terrorist networks like al-Qaeda, the spread of catastrophic weapons, cyberthreats, failed states, rogue regimes,persistent conflict. And now we have to add to our list piracy. The CIA is unique in the capabilities of collection, analysis and operation that you bring to bear. So you are an indispensable tool, the tip of the spear in America   s intelligence missionand our national security. It is because of you that I can make good decisions. You prove that the key to good intelligence is not simply technology. It   s the quality of the men and women who have signedup to serve. You   re on the front lines against unconventional challenges. You help us understand the world as it is. You support the work of our troops and our diplomats and law enforcement officers. You disrupt terrorist plots, and you   re critical to our efforts to destroy terrorist networks. You serve capably, courageously, and from here inVirginia to dangerous outposts around the globe, you make enormous sacrifices on our behalf. So you should be proud of what you do. Second, you need to know that you   ve got my full support. For decades, the American people have counted on you to protect them. I know that I   ve come to personally count on your services. I rely on your reporting and your analysis, which finds its way onto my desk everysingle day. And I know you   ve got a tough job. I know there   s no margin for error. And I know there are endless demands for intelligence. There is an urgent necessity to collect and analyzeinformation and to work seamlessly with other agencies to act on it. And -- And what makes it tougher is when you succeed, as you so often do, that success usually has to stay secret. So you don   t get credit when things go good, but you sure getsome blame when things don   t. Audience Member: [Words indistinct.] President Obama: Now -- I got an amen corner out there. Now, in that context, I know that the last few days have been difficult. As I made clear, in releasing the OLC memos as a consequence of a court case that was pending and to which it was very difficult for us to mount an effective legal defense, I acted primarily because of the exceptional circumstances that surrounded these memos, particularly the fact that so much of the information was public -- had been publicly acknowledged. Thecovert nature of the information had been compromised. I have fought to protect the integrity of classified information in the past, and I will do so in the future. And there is nothing more important than protecting the identities of CIA officers. So I need everybody to be clear: we will protect your identities and your security as you vigorously pursue your missions. I will be as vigorous in protecting you as you are vigorous inprotecting the American people. Now, I have put an end to the interrogation techniques described in those OLC memos. And I want to -- I want to be very clear and very blunt. I   ve done so for a simple reason: because I believe that our nation is stronger and more secure when we deploy the full measure of both our power and the power of our values, including the rule of law. I know I can count on you todo exactly that. You know, there have been some conversations that I   ve had with senior folks here at Langley in which I think people have expressed understandable anxiety and concern. So I -- I -- I want to make a point that I just made in the smaller group. I understand that it   s hard when you are asked to protect the American people against people who have no scruples and wouldwillingly and gladly kill innocents. Al-Qaeda   s not constrained by a constitution. Many of our adversaries are not constrained by a belief in freedom of speech or representation in court or rule of law. So I   m sure that sometimes it seems as if that means we   re operating with one hand tied behind our back or that those who would argue for a higher standard are naive. I understand that. You know, I   ve-- I watch the cable shows once in a while. What makes the United States special, and what makes you special, is precisely the fact that we are willing to uphold our values and ideals even when it   s hard -- not just when it   s easy; even when we are afraid and under threat -- not just when it   s expedient to do so. That   s whatmakes us different. So yes, you   ve got a harder job. And so do I. And that   s okay, because that   s why we can take such extraordinary pride in being Americans. And over the long term, that is why I believe wewill defeat our enemies: because we   re on the better side of history. So don   t be discouraged by what   s happened in the last few weeks. Don   t be discouraged that we have to acknowledge potentially we   ve made some mistakes. That   s how we learn. But the fact that we are willing to acknowledge them and then move forward, that is precisely why I am proud to be President of the United States, and that   s why you should be proud tobe members of the CIA. All right? Third point -- Third point -- I want you to know how much the American people appreciate your service. Sometimes it   s hard to acknowledge sacrifices made by the people whose work, or even identity, must remain secret, and that   s part of the enormous burden that you carry when you sign up. But you make the extraordinary sacrifice of giving up parts of your life in service to your country. Many of you take long deployments overseas. You miss seeing your families; you miss weekend barbecues and the birthday parties, watching your children grow up. You can   t even exchange in the simplest pleasures of talking about your job -- orcomplaining about your job openly. There are few signs of patriotism more powerful than offering to serve out of the limelight, and so many of you have signed up to serve after 9/11 -- that   s partly why you   re all so young -- fully aware of the dangers before you. You serve courageously, but your courage is only known to a few. You accomplish remarkable things, but the credit you receive is the private knowledge that you   ve done something to secure this country. That   s a sacrifice that   s carved into those marble walls. Those 89 stars stand as a testament to both the men and women of the CIA who gave their lives in service to their country, and to all who dedicate themselves tothe mission of this agency. Now we must look forward to the future with confidence. All that you   ve achieved, I believe that the CIA   s best days are still yet to come. And you will have my support and appreciationas you carry on this critical work. We live in dangerous times. I am going to need you more than ever, precisely because we   re seeing changes in our foreign policy, and we want to send a new message to the world. That requires better intelligence, not less of it. That means that we   re going to have to operate smarter and more effectively than ever. So I   m going to be relying on you, and the American people are going to rely on you. And I hope that you will continue to take extraordinary pridein the challenges that come with the job. Thank you very much. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America.",obama
"Thank you very much. To Sara Bloomfield, for the wonderful introduction and the outstandingwork she's doing; to Fred Zeidman; Joel Geiderman; Mr. Wiesel -- thank you for your wisdomand your witness; Speaker Nancy Pelosi; Senator Dick Durbin; members of Congress; ourgood friend the Ambassador of Israel; members of the United States Holocaust MemorialCouncil; and most importantly, the survivors and rescuers and their families who are heretoday. It is a great honor for me to be here, and I'm grateful that I have the opportunity toaddress you briefly. We gather today to mourn the loss of so many lives, and celebrate those who saved them;honor those who survived, and contemplate the obligations of the living. It is the grimmest of ironies that one of the most savage, barbaric acts of evil in history beganin one of the most modernized societies of its time, where so many markers of humanprogress became tools of human depravity: science that can heal used to kill; education thatcan enlighten used to rationalize away basic moral impulses; the bureaucracy that sustainsmodern life used as the machinery of mass death -- a ruthless, chillingly efficient systemwhere many were responsible for the killing, but few got actual blood on their hands. While the uniqueness of the Holocaust in scope and in method is truly astounding, theHolocaust was driven by many of the same forces that have fueled atrocities throughouthistory: the scapegoating that leads to hatred and blinds us to our common humanity; thejustifications that replace conscience and allow cruelty to spread; the willingness of those whoare neither perpetrators nor victims to accept the assigned role of bystander, believing the liethat good people are ever powerless or alone, the fiction that we do not have a choice. But while we are here today to bear witness to the human capacity to destroy, we are alsohere to pay tribute to the human impulse to save. In the moral accounting of the Holocaust,as we reckon with numbers like 6 million, as we recall the horror of numbers etched intoarms, we also factor in numbers like these: 7,200 -- the number of Danish Jews ferried tosafety, many of whom later returned home to find the neighbors who rescued them had alsofaithfully tended their homes and businesses and belongings while they were gone. We remember the number five -- the five righteous men and women who join us today fromPoland. We are awed by your acts of courage and conscience. And your presence todaycompels each of us to ask ourselves whether we would have done what you did. We can onlyhope that the answer is yes. We also remember the number 5,000 -- the number of Jews rescued by the villagers of LeChambon, France -- one life saved for each of its 5,000 residents. Not a single Jew who camethere was turned away, or turned in. But it was not until decades later that the villagers spokeof what they had done -- and even then, only reluctantly. The author of a book on the rescuefound that those he interviewed were baffled by his interest. ""How could you call us 'good'?""they said. ""We were doing what had to be done."" That is the question of the righteous -- those who would do extraordinary good atextraordinary risk not for affirmation or acclaim or to advance their own interests, but becauseit is what must be done. They remind us that no one is born a savior or a murderer -- theseare choices we each have the power to make. They teach us that no one can make us intobystanders without our consent, and that we are never truly alone -- that if we have thecourage to heed that ""still, small voice"" within us, we can form a minyan for righteousnessthat can span a village, even a nation. Their legacy is our inheritance. And the question is, how do we honor and preserve it? How dowe ensure that ""never again"" isn't an empty slogan, or merely an aspiration, but also a call toaction? I believe we start by doing what we are doing today -- by bearing witness, by fighting thesilence that is evil's greatest co-conspirator. In the face of horrors that defy comprehension, the impulse to silence is understandable. Myown great uncle returned from his service in World War II in a state of shock, saying little,alone with painful memories that would not leave his head. He went up into the attic,according to the stories that I've heard, and wouldn't come down for six months. He was oneof the liberators -- someone who at a very tender age had seen the unimaginable. And sosome of the liberators who are here today honor us with their presence -- all of whom wehonor for their extraordinary service. My great uncle was part of the 89th Infantry Division --the first Americans to reach a Nazi concentration camp. And they liberated Ohrdruf, part ofBuchenwald, where tens of thousands had perished. The story goes that when the Americans marched in, they discovered the starving survivorsand the piles of dead bodies. And General Eisenhower made a decision. He ordered Germansfrom the nearby town to tour the camp, so they could see what had been done in their name.And he ordered American troops to tour the camp, so they could see the evil they werefighting against. Then he invited congressmen and journalists to bear witness. And he orderedthat photographs and films be made. Some of us have seen those same images, whether inthe Holocaust Museum or when I visited Yad Vashem, and they never leave you. Eisenhowersaid that he wanted ""to be in a position to give firsthand evidence of these things, if ever, inthe future, there develops a tendency to charge these allegations merely to propaganda."" Eisenhower understood the danger of silence. He understood that if no one knew what hadhappened, that would be yet another atrocity -- and it would be the perpetrators' ultimatetriumph. What Eisenhower did to record these crimes for history is what we are doing here today.That's what Elie Wiesel and the survivors we honor here do by fighting to make theirmemories part of our collective memory. That's what the Holocaust Museum does every dayon our National Mall, the place where we display for the world our triumphs and failures andthe lessons we've learned from our history. It's the very opposite of silence. But we must also remember that bearing witness is not the end of our obligation -- it's justthe beginning. We know that evil has yet to run its course on Earth. We've seen it in thiscentury in the mass graves and the ashes of villages burned to the ground, and children usedas soldiers and rape used as a weapon of war. To this day, there are those who insist theHolocaust never happened; who perpetrate every form of intolerance -- racism and anti- Semitism, homophobia, xenophobia, sexism, and more -- hatred that degrades its victim anddiminishes us all. Today, and every day, we have an opportunity, as well as an obligation, to confront thesescourges -- to fight the impulse to turn the channel when we see images that disturb us, orwrap ourselves in the false comfort that others' sufferings are not our own. Instead we havethe opportunity to make a habit of empathy; to recognize ourselves in each other; to commitourselves to resisting injustice and intolerance and indifference in whatever forms they maytake -- whether confronting those who tell lies about history, or doing everything we can toprevent and end atrocities like those that took place in Rwanda, those taking place in Darfur.That is my commitment as President. I hope that is yours, as well. It will not be easy. At times, fulfilling these obligations require self-reflection. But in the finalanalysis, I believe history gives us cause for hope rather than despair -- the hope of a chosenpeople who have overcome oppression since the days of Exodus; of the nation of Israel risingfrom the destruction of the Holocaust; of the strong and enduring bonds between our nations. It is the hope, too, of those who not only survived, but chose to live, teaching us the meaningof courage and resilience and dignity. I'm thinking today of a study conducted after the warthat found that Holocaust survivors living in America actually had a higher birthrate thanAmerican Jews. What a stunning act of faith -- to bring a child in a world that has shown youso much cruelty; to believe that no matter what you have endured, or how much you havelost, in the end, you have a duty to life. We find cause for hope as well in Protestant and Catholic children attending school together inNorthern Ireland; in Hutus and Tutsis living side by side, forgiving neighbors who have donethe unforgivable; in a movement to save Darfur that has thousands of high school and collegechapters in 25 countries, and brought 70,000 people to the Washington Mall -- people ofevery age and faith and background and race united in common cause with suffering brothersand sisters halfway around the world. Those numbers can be our future -- our fellow citizens of the world showing us how to makethe journey from oppression to survival, from witness to resistance, and ultimately toreconciliation. That is what we mean when we say ""never again."" So today, during this season when we celebrate liberation, resurrection, and the possibility ofredemption, may each of us renew our resolve to do what must be done. And may we striveeach day, both individually and as a nation, to be among the righteous. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.",obama
"[Teleprompters rise.] Good evening. Pause for laughter. Wait a minute, this may not be working as well as I -- Letme try that again. Good evening, everybody. I would like to welcome you all to the 10-day anniversary of myfirst 100 days. I am Barack Obama. Most of you covered me. All of you voted for me.Apologies to the Fox table. They're -- Where are they? I have to confess I really did not wantto be here tonight, but I knew I had to come -- just one more problem that I've inherited fromGeorge W. Bush.But now that I'm here, it's great to be here. It's great to see all of you. Michelle Obama ishere, the First Lady of the United States. Hasn't she been an outstanding First Lady? She'seven begun to bridge the differences that have divided us for so long, because no matterwhich party you belong to we can all agree that Michelle has the right to bare arms.Now Sasha and Malia aren't here tonight because they're grounded. You can't just take AirForce One on a joy ride to Manhattan. I don't care whose kids you are. We've been settingsome ground rules here. They're starting to get a little carried away. Now, speaking -- when I think about children obviously I think about Michelle and it remindsme that tomorrow is Mother's Day. Happy Mother's Day to all the mothers in the audience. Ido have to say, though, that this is a tough holiday for Rahm Emanuel because he's not usedto saying the word ""day"" after ""mother."" That's true.David Axelrod is here. You know, David and I have been together for a long time. I can stillremember -- I got to sort of -- I tear up a little bit when I think back to that day that I calledAx so many years ago and said, you and I can do wonderful things together. And he said tome the same thing that partners all across America are saying to one another right now: Let'sgo to Iowa and make it official.Michael Steele is in the house tonight. Or as he would say, ""in the heezy."" What's up? Whereis Michael? Michael, for the last time, the Republican Party does not qualify for a bailout. RushLimbaugh does not count as a troubled asset, I'm sorry.Dick Cheney was supposed to be here but he is very busy working on his memoirs, tentativelytitled, ""How to Shoot Friends and Interrogate People.""You know, it's been a whirlwind of activity these first hundred days. We've enacted a majoreconomic recovery package, we passed a budget, we forged a new path in Iraq, and noPresident in history has ever named three Commerce Secretaries this quickly. Which remindsme, if Judd Gregg is here, your business cards are ready now.On top of that, I've also reversed the ban on stem cell research, signed an expansion --signed an expansion of the children's health insurance. Just last week, Car and Driver namedme auto executive of the year. Something I'm very proud of.We've also begun to change the culture in Washington. We've even made the White House aplace where people can learn and can grow. Just recently, Larry Summers asked if he couldchair the White House Council on Women and Girls. And I do appreciate that Larry is heretonight because it is seven hours past his bedtime. Gibbs liked that one. In the last hundred days, we've also grown the Democratic Party by infusing it with newenergy and bringing in fresh, young faces like Arlen Specter. Now, Joe Biden rightly deservesa lot of credit for convincing Arlen to make the switch, but Secretary Clinton actually had a lotto do with it too. One day she just pulled him aside and she said, Arlen, you know what Ialways say -- ""if you can't beat them, join them."" Which brings me to another thing that's changed in this new, warmer, fuzzier White House,and that's my relationship with Hillary. You know, we had been rivals during the campaign,but these days we could not be closer. In fact, the second she got back from Mexico shepulled into a hug and gave me a big kiss. Told me I'd better get down there myself. Which Ireally appreciated. I mean, it was -- it was nice. And of course we've also begun to change America's image in the world. We talked about thisduring this campaign and we're starting to execute. We've renewed alliances with importantpartners and friends. If you look on the screen there, there I am with Japanese Prime MinisterTaro Aso. There I am with Gordon Brown. But as I said during the campaign, we can't just talk to our friends. As hard as it is, we alsohave to talk to our enemies, and I've begun to do exactly that. Take a look at the monitorthere. Now, let me be clear, just because he handed me a copy of Peter Pan does not meanthat I'm going to read it -- but it's good diplomatic practice to just accept these gifts.All this change hasn't been easy. Change never is. So I've cut the tension by bringing a newfriend to the White House. He's warm, he's cuddly, loyal, enthusiastic. You just have to keephim on a tight leash. Every once in a while he goes charging off in the wrong direction andgets himself into trouble. But enough about Joe Biden. All in all, we're proud of the change we've brought to Washington in these first hundred daysbut we've got a lot of work left to do, as all of you know. So I'd like to talk a little bit aboutwhat my administration plans to achieve in the next hundred days.During the second hundred days, we will design, build and open a library dedicated to my firsthundred days. It's going to be big, folks. In the next hundred days, I will learn to go off theprompter and Joe Biden will learn to stay on the prompter. In the next hundred days, our bipartisan outreach will be so successful that even JohnBoehner will consider becoming a Democrat. After all, we have a lot in common. He is aperson of color. Although not a color that appears in the natural world. What's up, John?In the next hundred days, I will meet with a leader who rules over millions with an iron fist,who owns the airwaves and uses his power to crush all who would challenge his authority atthe ballot box. It's good to see you, Mayor Bloomberg. In the next hundred days, we will housetrain our dog, Bo, because the last thing Tim Geithnerneeds is someone else treating him like a fire hydrant. In the next hundred days, I willstrongly consider losing my cool.Finally, I believe that my next hundred days will be so successful I will be able to completethem in 72 days. And on the 73rd day, I will rest. I just -- I want to end by saying a few words about the men and women in this room whosejob it is to inform the public and pursue the truth. You know, we meet tonight at a moment ofextraordinary challenge for this nation and for the world, but it's also a time of real hardshipfor the field of journalism. And like so many other businesses in this global age, you've seensweeping changes and technology and communications that lead to a sense of uncertainty andanxiety about what the future will hold. Across the country, there are extraordinary, hardworking journalists who have lost their jobsin recent days, recent weeks, recent months. And I know that each newspaper and mediaoutlet is wrestling with how to respond to these changes, and some are struggling simply tostay open. And it won't be easy. Not every ending will be a happy one. But it's also true that your ultimate success as an industry is essential to the success of ourdemocracy. It's what makes this thing work. You know, Thomas Jefferson once said that if hehad the choice between a government without newspapers, or newspapers without agovernment, he would not hesitate to choose the latter. Clearly, Thomas Jefferson never had cable news to contend with -- but his central pointremains: A government without newspapers, a government without a tough and vibrantmedia of all sorts, is not an option for the United States of America.So I may not -- I may not agree with everything you write or report. I may even complain, ormore likely Gibbs will complain, from time to time about how you do your jobs, but I do sowith the knowledge that when you are at your best, then you help me be at my best. You helpall of us who serve at the pleasure of the American people do our jobs better by holding usaccountable, by demanding honesty, by preventing us from taking shortcuts and falling intoeasy political games that people are so desperately weary of. And that kind of reporting is worth preserving -- not just for your sake, but for the public's.We count on you to help us make sense of a complex world and tell the stories of our lives theway they happen, and we look for you for truth, even if it's always an approximation, even if - - This is a season of renewal and reinvention. That is what government must learn to do, that'swhat businesses must learn to do, and that's what journalism is in the process of doing. Andwhen I look out at this room and think about the dedicated men and women whose questionsI've answered over the last few years, I know that for all the challenges this industry faces,it's not short on talent or creativity or passion or commitment. It's not short of young peoplewho are eager to break news or the not-so-young who still manage to ask the tough onestime and time again. These qualities alone will not solve all your problems, but they certainlyprove that the problems are worth solving. And that is a good place as any to begin.So I offer you my thanks, I offer you my support, and I look forward to working with you andanswering to you and the American people as we seek a more perfect union in the monthsand years ahead.Thank you very much, everybody.

"President  Obama:  Thank  you  very  much.  Thank  you,  Notre  Dame.  Thank  you.  Thank  you.   Please,  have  a  seat.  Thank  you...   Well  first  of  all,  congratulations,  Class  of  2009.  Congratulations  to  all  the  parents,  the  cousins,   the  aunts,  the  uncles        all  the  people  who  helped  to  bring  you  to  the  point  that  you  are  here   today.  Thank  you  so  much  to  Father  Jenkins  for  that  extraordinary  introduction,  even  though   you  said  what  I  want  to  say  much  more  elegantly.  You  are  doing  an  extraordinary  job  as   president  of  this  extraordinary  institution,  and  your  continued  and  courageous  and  contagious   commitment  to  honest,  thoughtful  dialogue  is  an  inspiration  to  us  all.   So,  good  afternoon,  to  Father  Hesburgh,  to  Notre  Dame  trustees,  to  faculty,  to  family.  I  am   honored  to  be  here  today.  And  I  am  grateful  to  all  of  you  for  allowing  me  to  be  a  part  of  your   graduation.  And  I  also  want  to  thank  you  for  the  honorary  degree  that  I  received.  I  know  it   has  not  been  without  controversy.  I  don't  know  if  you're  aware  of  this,  but  these  honorary   degrees  are  apparently  pretty  hard  to  come  by.  So  far  I'm  only  1  for  2  as  President.   Father...Hesburgh  is  150  for  150.  I  guess  that's  better.  So,  Father  Ted  after  the  ceremony   maybe  you  can  give  me  some  pointers  to  boost  my  average.   I  also  want  to  congratulate  the  Class  of  2009  for  all  your  accomplishments.  And  since         [Audience  member  interrupts  with  pro  life  slogans]   President  Obama:  And  since        this  is  Notre  Dame   That's...all  right.  And  since         [Audience  chants  ""We  are  ND!  We  are  ND!""] Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Property  of  .       Copyright  2009.  All  rights  reserved.   Page  1      President  Obama:  We're  fine,  everybody.  We're  following  Brennan's  adage  that  we  don't  do   things  easily.  We're  not  going  to  shy  away  from  things  that  are  uncomfortable  sometimes.   Now,  since        since  this  is  Notre  Dame  I  think  we  should  talk  not  only  about  your   accomplishments  in  the  classroom,  but  also  in  the  competitive  arena.  No,  don't  worry,  I'm  not   going  to  talk  about  that.  We  all  know  about  this  university's  proud  and  storied  football  team,   but  I  also  hear  that  Notre  Dame  holds  the  largest  outdoor  5  on  5  basketball  tournament  in   the  world        ""Bookstore  Basketball.""   Now  this  excites  me.  I  want  to  congratulate  the  winners  of  this  year's  tournament,  a  team  by   the  name  of  ""Hallelujah  Holla  Back.""  Congratulations.  Well  done.  Though  I  have  to  say,  I'm   personally  disappointed  that  the  ""Barack  O'Ballers""  did  not  pull  it  out  this  year.  So  next  year,   if  you  need  a  6'2""  forward  with  a  decent  jumper,  you  know  where  I  live.   Now,  every  one  of  you  should  be  proud  of  what  you've  achieved  at  this  institution.  One   hundred  and  sixty  three  classes  of  Notre  Dame  graduates  have  sat  where  you  sit  today.  Some   were  here  during  years  that  simply  rolled  into  the  next  without  much  notice  or  fanfare         periods  of  relative  peace  and  prosperity  that  required  little  by  way  of  sacrifice  or  struggle.   You,  however,  are  not  getting  off  that  easy.  You  have  a  different  deal.  Your  class  has  come  of   age  at  a  moment  of  great  consequence  for  our  nation  and  for  the  world        a  rare  inflection   point  in  history  where  the  size  and  scope  of  the  challenges  before  us  require  that  we  remake   our  world  to  renew  its  promise,  that  we  align  our  deepest  values  and  commitments  to  the   demands  of  a  new  age.  It's  a  privilege  and  a  responsibility  afforded  to  few  generations        and   a  task  that  you're  now  called  to  fulfill.   This  generation,  your  generation  is  the  one  that  must  find  a  path  back  to  prosperity  and   decide  how  we  respond  to  a  global  economy  that  left  millions  behind  even  before  the  most   recent  crisis  hit        an  economy  where  greed  and  short  term  thinking  were  too  often  rewarded   at  the  expense  of  fairness,  and  diligence,  and  an  honest  day's  work.   Your  generation  must  decide  how  to  save  God's  creation  from  a  changing  climate  that   threatens  to  destroy  it.  Your  generation  must  seek  peace  at  a  time  when  there  are  those  who   will  stop  at  nothing  to  do  us  harm,  and  when  weapons  in  the  hands  of  a  few  can  destroy  the   many.  And  we  must  find  a  way  to  reconcile  our  ever  shrinking  world  with  its  ever  growing   diversity        diversity  of  thought,  diversity  of  culture,  and  diversity  of  belief.   In  short,  we  must  find  a  way  to  live  together  as  one  human  family.  And  it's  this  last  challenge   that  I'd  like  to  talk  about  today,  despite  the  fact  that  Father  John  stole  all  my  best  lines.  For   the  major  threats  we  face  in  the  21st  century        whether  it's  global  recession  or  violent   extremism,  the  spread  of  nuclear  weapons  or  pandemic  disease        these  things  do  not   discriminate.  They  do  not  recognize  borders.  They  do  not  see  color.  They  do  not  target  specific   ethnic  groups.  Moreover,  no  one  person,  or  religion,  or  nation  can  meet  these  challenges   alone.  Our  very  survival  has  never  required  greater  cooperation  and  greater  understanding   among  all  people  from  all  places  than  at  this  moment  in  history.

Page  2      Unfortunately,  finding  that  common  ground        recognizing  that  our  fates  are  tied  up,  as  Dr.   King  said,  in  a  ""single  garment  of  destiny""        is  not  easy.  And  part  of  the  problem,  of  course,   lies  in  the  imperfections  of  man        our  selfishness,  our  pride,  our  stubbornness,  our   acquisitiveness,  our  insecurities,  our  egos        all  the  cruelties  large  and  small  that  those  of  us   in  the  Christian  tradition  understand  to  be  rooted  in  original  sin.  We  too  often  seek  advantage   over  others.  We  cling  to  outworn  prejudice  and  fear  those  who  are  unfamiliar.  Too  many  of  us   view  life  only  through  the  lens  of  immediate  self  interest  and  crass  materialism        in  which  the   world  is  necessarily  a  zero  sum  game.  The  strong  too  often  dominate  the  weak,  and  too  many   of  those  with  wealth  and  with  power  find  all  manner  of  justification  for  their  own  privilege  in   the  face  of  poverty  and  injustice.   And  so  for  all  our  technology  and  scientific  advances,  we  see  here  in  this  country  and  around   the  globe  violence  and  want  and  strife  that  would  seem  sadly  familiar  to  those  in  ancient   times.  We  know  these  things.  And  hopefully  one  of  the  benefits  of  the  wonderful  education   that  you  have  received  here  at  Notre  Dame  is  that  you've  had  time  to  consider  these  wrongs   in  the  world,  perhaps  recognized  impulses  in  yourself  that  you  want  to  leave  behind.  You've   grown  determined        each  in  your  own  way        to  right  them.  And  yet  one  of  the  vexing  things   for  those  of  us  interested  in  promoting  greater  understanding  and  cooperation  among  people   is  the  discovery  that  even  bringing  together  persons  of  good  will,  bringing  together  men  and   women  of  principle  and  purpose        even  accomplishing  that  can  be  difficult.   The  soldier  and  the  lawyer  may  both  love  this  country  with  equal  passion,  and  yet  reach  very   different  conclusions  on  the  specific  steps  needed  to  protect  us  from  harm.  The  gay  activist   and  the  evangelical  pastor  may  both  deplore  the  ravages  of  HIV/AIDS,  but  find  themselves   unable  to  bridge  the  cultural  divide  that  might  unite  their  efforts.  Those  who  speak  out  against   stem  cell  research  may  be  rooted  in  an  admirable  conviction  about  the  sacredness  of  life,  but   so  are  the  parents  of  a  child  with  juvenile  diabetes  who  are  convinced  that  their  son's  or   daughter's  hardships  might  be  relieved.   The  question,  then,  is  how  do  we  work  through  these  conflicts?  Is  it  possible  for  us  to  join   hands  in  common  effort?  As  citizens  of  a  vibrant  and  varied  democracy,  how  do  we  engage  in   vigorous  debate?  How  does  each  of  us  remain  firm  in  our  principles,  and  fight  for  what  we   consider  right,  without,  as  Father  John  said,  demonizing  those  with  just  as  strongly  held   convictions  on  the  other  side?  And  of  course,  nowhere  do  these  questions  come  up  more   powerfully  than  on  the  issue  of  abortion.   As  I  considered  the  controversy  surrounding  my  visit  here,  I  was  reminded  of  an  encounter  I   had  during  my  Senate  campaign,  one  that  I  describe  in  a  book  I  wrote  called  The  Audacity  of   Hope.  In  a  few  days  after  I  won  the  Democratic  nomination,  I  received  an  e  mail  from  a   doctor  who  told  me  that  while  he  voted  for  me  in  the  Illinois  primary,  he  had  a  serious   concern  that  might  prevent  him  from  voting  for  me  in  the  general  election.  He  described   himself  as  a  Christian  who  was  strongly  pro  life        but  that  was  not  what  was  preventing  him   potentially  from  voting  for  me. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Property  of  .       Copyright  2009.  All  rights  reserved.   Page  3      What  bothered  the  doctor  was  an  entry  that  my  campaign  staff  had  posted  on  my  website         an  entry  that  said  I  would  fight,  quote,  ""right  wing  ideologues  who  want  to  take  away  a   woman's  right  to  choose,""  unquote.  The  doctor  said  he  had  assumed  I  was  a  reasonable   person.  He  supported  my  policy  initiatives  to  help  the  poor  and  to  lift  up  our  educational   system,  but  that  if  I  truly  believed  that  every  pro  life  individual  was  simply  an  ideologue  who   wanted  to  inflict  suffering  on  women,  then  I  was  not  very  reasonable.  He  wrote,  ""I  do  not  ask   at  this  point  that  you  oppose  abortion,  only  that  you  speak  about  this  issue  in  fair  minded   words.""   Fair  minded  words.   After  I  read  the  doctor's  letter,  I  wrote  back  to  him  and  I  thanked  him.  And  I  didn't  change  my   underlying  position,  but  I  did  tell  my  staff  to  change  the  words  on  my  website.  And  I  said  a   prayer  that  night  that  I  might  extend  the  same  presumption  of  good  faith  to  others  that  the   doctor  had  extended  to  me    because  when  we  do  that        when  we  open  up  our  hearts  and  our   minds  to  those  who  may  not  think  precisely  like  we  do  or  believe  precisely  what  we  believe         that's  when  we  discover  at  least  the  possibility  of  common  ground.  That's  when  we  begin  to   say,  ""Maybe  we  won't  agree  on  abortion,  but  we  can  still  agree  that  this  heart  wrenching   decision  for  any  woman  is  not  made  casually,  and  it  has  both  moral  and  spiritual  dimensions.   So  let  us  work  together  to  reduce  the  number  of  women  seeking  abortions.  Let's  reduce   unintended  pregnancies.  Let's  make  adoption  more  available.  Let's  provide  care  and  support   for  women  who  do  carry  their  children  to  term.  Let's  honor  the  conscience  of  those  who   disagree  with  abortion,  and  draft  a  sensible  conscience  clause,  and  make  sure  that  all  of  our   health  care  policies  are  grounded  not  only  in  sound  science,  but  also  in  clear  ethics,  as  well  as   respect  for  the  equality  of  women.  Those  are  things  we  can  do.   Now,  understand,  Class  of  2009,  I  do  not  suggest  that  the  debate  surrounding  abortion  can  or   should  go  away,  because  no  matter  how  much  we  may  want  to  fudge  it        indeed,  while  we   know  that  the  views  of  most  Americans  on  the  subject  are  complex  and  even  contradictory         the  fact  is  that  at  some  level,  the  views  of  the  two  camps  are  irreconcilable.  Each  side  will   continue  to  make  its  case  to  the  public  with  passion  and  conviction.  But  surely  we  can  do  so   without  reducing  those  with  differing  views  to  caricature.   Open  hearts.  Open  minds.  Fair  minded  words.  It's  a  way  of  life  that  has  always  been  the   Notre  Dame  tradition.  Father  Hesburgh  has  long  spoken  of  this  institution  as  both  a  lighthouse   and  a  crossroads,  a  lighthouse  that  stands  apart,  shining  with  the  wisdom  of  the  Catholic   tradition,  while  the  crossroads  is  where  ""differences  of  culture  and  religion  and  conviction  can   co  exist  with  friendship,  civility,  hospitality,  and  especially  love.""  And  I  want  to  join  him  and   Father  John  in  saying  how  inspired  I  am  by  the  maturity  and  responsibility  with  which  this   class  has  approached  the  debate  surrounding  today's  ceremony.  You  are  an  example  of  what   Notre  Dame  is  about.   Now,  this  tradition  of  cooperation  and  understanding  is  one  that  I  learned  in  my  own  life  many   years  ago        also  with  the  help  of  the  Catholic  Church.

Page  4      You  see,  I  was  not  raised  in  a  particularly  religious  household,  but  my  mother  instilled  in  me  a   sense  of  service  and  empathy  that  eventually  led  me  to  become  a  community  organizer  after  I   graduated  college.  And  a  group  of  Catholic  churches  in  Chicago  helped  fund  an  organization   known  as  the  ""Developing  Communities  Project,""  and  we  worked  to  lift  up  South  Side   neighborhoods  that  had  been  devastated  when  the  local  steel  plant  closed.   And  it  was  quite  an  eclectic  crew        Catholic  and  Protestant  churches,  Jewish  and  African   American  organizers,  working  class  black,  white,  and  Hispanic  residents        all  of  us  with   different  experiences,  all  of  us  with  different  beliefs    but  all  of  us  learned  to  work  side  by  side   because  all  of  us  saw  in  these  neighborhoods  other  human  beings  who  needed  our  help  to  find   jobs  and  improve  schools.  We  were  bound  together  in  the  service  of  others.   And  something  else  happened  during  the  time  I  spent  in  these  neighborhoods,  perhaps   because  the  church  folks  I  worked  with  were  so  welcoming  and  understanding    perhaps   because  they  invited  me  to  their  services  and  sang  with  me  from  their  hymnals    perhaps   because  I  was  really  broke  and  they  fed  me    perhaps  because  I  witnessed  all  of  the  good   works  their  faith  inspired  them  to  perform,  I  found  myself  drawn  not  just  to  the  work  with  the   church    I  was  drawn  to  be  in  the  church.  It  was  through  this  service  that  I  was  brought  to   Christ.   And  at  the  time,  Cardinal  Joseph  Bernardin  was  the  Archbishop  of  Chicago.  And  for  those  of   you  too  young  to  have  known  him  or  known  of  him,  he  was  a  kind  and  good  and  wise  man    a   saintly  man.  I  can  still  remember  him  speaking  at  one  of  the  first  organizing  meetings  I   attended  on  the  South  Side.  He  stood  as  both  a  lighthouse  and  a  crossroads        unafraid  to   speak  his  mind  on  moral  issues  ranging  from  poverty  and  AIDS  and  abortion  to  the  death   penalty  and  nuclear  war.  And  yet,  he  was  congenial  and  gentle  in  his  persuasion,  always   trying  to  bring  people  together,  always  trying  to  find  common  ground.  And  just  before  he   died,  a  reporter  asked  Cardinal  Bernardin  about  this  approach  to  his  ministry.  And  he  said,   ""You  can't  really  get  on  with  preaching  the  Gospel  until  you've  touched  hearts  and  minds.""   My  heart  and  mind  were  touched  by  him.  They  were  touched  by  the  words  and  deeds  of  the   men  and  women  I  worked  alongside  in  parishes  across  Chicago.  And  I'd  like  to  think  that  we   touched  the  hearts  and  minds  of  the  neighborhood  families  whose  lives  we  helped  change.  For   this,  I  believe,  is  our  highest  calling.   Now,  you,  Class  of  2009,  are  about  to  enter  the  next  phase  of  your  life  at  a  time  of  great   uncertainty.  You'll  be  called  to  help  restore  a  free  market  that's  also  fair  to  all  who  are  willing   to  work.  You'll  be  called  to  seek  new  sources  of  energy  that  can  save  our  planet    to  give   future  generations  the  same  chance  that  you  had  to  receive  an  extraordinary  education.  And   whether  as  a  person  drawn  to  public  service,  or  simply  someone  who  insists  on  being  an   active  citizen,  you  will  be  exposed  to  more  opinions  and  ideas  broadcast  through  more  means   of  communication  than  ever  existed  before.  You'll  hear  talking  heads  scream  on  cable    and   you'll  read  blogs  that  claim  definitive  knowledge    and  you  will  watch  politicians  pretend  they   know  what  they're  talking  about. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Property  of  .       Copyright  2009.  All  rights  reserved.   Page  5      Occasionally,  you  may  have  the  great  fortune  of  actually  seeing  important  issues  debated  by   people  who  do  know  what  they're  talking  about        by  well  intentioned  people  with  brilliant   minds  and  mastery  of  the  facts.  In  fact,  I  suspect  that  some  of  you  will  be  among  those   brightest  stars.   And  in  this  world  of  competing  claims  about  what  is  right  and  what  is  true,  have  confidence  in   the  values  with  which  you've  been  raised  and  educated.  Be  unafraid  to  speak  your  mind  when   those  values  are  at  stake.  Hold  firm  to  your  faith  and  allow  it  to  guide  you  on  your  journey.  In   other  words,  stand  as  a  lighthouse.  But  remember,  too,  that  you  can  be  a  crossroads.   Remember,  too,  that  the  ultimate  irony  of  faith  is  that  it  necessarily  admits  doubt.  It's  the   belief  in  things  not  seen.  It's  beyond  our  capacity  as  human  beings  to  know  with  certainty   what  God  has  planned  for  us  or  what  He  asks  of  us.  And  those  of  us  who  believe  must  trust   that  His  wisdom  is  greater  than  our  own.   And  this  doubt  should  not  push  us  away  our  faith.  But  it  should  humble  us.  It  should  temper   our  passions,  cause  us  to  be  wary  of  too  much  self  righteousness.  It  should  compel  us  to   remain  open  and  curious  and  eager  to  continue  the  spiritual  and  moral  debate  that  began  for   so  many  of  you  within  the  walls  of  Notre  Dame.  And  within  our  vast  democracy,  this  doubt   should  remind  us  even  as  we  cling  to  our  faith  to  persuade  through  reason,  through  an   appeal,  whenever  we  can,  to  universal  rather  than  parochial  principles,  and  most  of  all   through  an  abiding  example  of  good  works  and  charity  and  kindness  and  service  that  moves   hearts  and  minds.   For  if  there  is  one  law  that  we  can  be  most  certain  of,  it  is  the  law  that  binds  people  of  all   faiths  and  no  faith  together.  It's  no  coincidence  that  it  exists  in  Christianity  and  Judaism,  in   Islam  and  Hinduism,  in  Buddhism  and  humanism.  It  is,  of  course,  the  Golden  Rule        the  call   to  treat  one  another  as  we  wish  to  be  treated.  The  call  to  love.  The  call  to  serve.  To  do  what   we  can  to  make  a  difference  in  the  lives  of  those  with  whom  we  share  the  same  brief  moment   on  this  Earth.  So  many  of  you  at  Notre  Dame        by  the  last  count,  upwards  of  80  percent         have  lived  this  law  of  love  through  the  service  you've  performed  at  schools  and  hospitals,   international  relief  agencies  and  local  charities.  Brennan  is  just  one  example  of  what  your   class  has  accomplished.  That's  incredibly  impressive,  a  powerful  testament  to  this  institution.   And  now  you  must  carry  the  tradition  forward.  Make  it  a  way  of  life.  Because  when  you  serve,   it  doesn't  just  improve  your  community,  it  makes  you  a  part  of  your  community.  It  breaks   down  walls.  It  fosters  cooperation.  And  when  that  happens        when  people  set  aside  their   differences,  even  for  a  moment,  to  work  in  common  effort  toward  a  common  goal    when  they   struggle  together,  and  sacrifice  together,  and  learn  from  one  another        then  all  things  are   possible.   After  all,  I  stand  here  today,  as  President  and  as  an  African  American,  on  the  55th  anniversary   of  the  day  that  the  Supreme  Court  handed  down  the  decision  in  Brown  versus  Board  of   Education.  Now,  Brown  was  of  course  the  first  major  step  in  dismantling  the  ""separate  but   equal""  doctrine.  But  it  would  take  a  number  of  years  and  a  nationwide  movement  to  fully   realize  the  dream  of  civil  rights  for  all  of  God's  children. Transcription  by  Michael  E.

Page  6      There  were  freedom  rides  and  lunch  counters  and  Billy  clubs,  and  there  was  also  a  Civil  Rights   Commission  appointed  by  President  Eisenhower.  It  was  the  12  resolutions  recommended  by   this  commission  that  would  ultimately  become  law  in  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964.   There  were  six  members  of  this  commission.  It  included  five  whites  and  one  African  American,   Democrats  and  Republicans,  two  Southern  governors,  the  dean  of  a  Southern  law  school,  a   Midwestern  university  president,  and  your  own  Father  Ted  Hesburgh,  President  of  Notre   Dame.  So  they  worked  for  two  years,  and  at  times  President  Eisenhower  had  to  intervene   personally  since  no  hotel  or  restaurant  in  the  South  would  serve  the  black  and  white  members   of  the  commission  together.  And  finally  when  they  reached  an  impasse  in  Louisiana,  Father   Ted  flew  them  all  to  Notre  Dame's  retreat  in  Land  O'Lakes,  Wisconsin        where  they  eventually   overcame  their  differences  and  hammered  out  a  final  deal.   And  years  later,  President  Eisenhower  asked  Father  Ted  how  on  earth  he  was  able  to  broker   an  agreement  between  men  of  such  different  backgrounds  and  beliefs.  And  Father  Ted  simply   said  that  during  their  first  dinner  in  Wisconsin  they  discovered  they  were  all  fishermen.  And  so   he  quickly  readied  a  boat  for  a  twilight  trip  out  on  the  lake.  They  fished,  and  they  talked,  and   they  changed  the  course  of  history.   I  will  not  pretend  that  the  challenges  we  face  will  be  easy,  or  that  the  answers  will  come   quickly,  or  that  all  our  differences  and  divisions  will  fade  happily  away        because  life  is  not   that  simple.  It  never  has  been.  But  as  you  leave  here  today,  remember  the  lessons  of  Cardinal   Bernardin,  of  Father  Hesburgh,  of  movements  for  change  both  large  and  small.  Remember   that  each  of  us,  endowed  with  the  dignity  possessed  by  all  children  of  God,  has  the  grace  to   recognize  ourselves  in  one  another    to  understand  that  we  all  seek  the  same  love  of  family,   the  same  fulfillment  of  a  life  well  lived.  Remember  that  in  the  end,  in  some  way  we  are  all   fishermen.   If  nothing  else,  that  knowledge  should  give  us  faith  that  through  our  collective  labor,  and   God's  providence,  and  our  willingness  to  shoulder  each  other's  burdens,  America  will  continue   on  its  precious  journey  towards  that  more  perfect  union.  Congratulations,  Class  of  2009.   May  God  bless  you,  and  may  God  bless  the  United  States  of  America. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Property  of  .

"We meet today at a transformational moment -- a moment in history when our interconnectedworld presents us, at once, with great promise but also great peril. Now, over the past four months my Administration has taken decisive steps to seize thepromise and confront these perils. We're working to recover from a global recession whilelaying a new foundation for lasting prosperity. We're strengthening our armed forces as theyfight two wars, at the same time we're renewing American leadership to confrontunconventional challenges, from nuclear proliferation to terrorism, from climate change topandemic disease. And we're bringing to government -- and to this White House --unprecedented transparency and accountability and new ways for Americans to participate intheir democracy. But none of this progress would be possible, and none of these 21st century challenges can befully met, without America's digital infrastructure -- the backbone that underpins a prosperouseconomy and a strong military and an open and efficient government. Without that foundationwe can't get the job done. It's long been said that the revolutions in communications and information technology havegiven birth to a virtual world. But make no mistake: This world -- cyberspace -- is a world thatwe depend on every single day. It's our hardware and our software, our desktops and laptopsand cell phones and Blackberries that have become woven into every aspect of our lives. It's the broadband networks beneath us and the wireless signals around us, the local networksin our schools and hospitals and businesses, and the massive grids that power our nation. It'sthe classified military and intelligence networks that keep us safe, and the World Wide Webthat has made us more interconnected than at any time in human history. So cyberspace is real. And so are the risks that come with it. It's the great irony of our Information Age -- the very technologies that empower us to createand to build also empower those who would disrupt and destroy. And this paradox -- seen andunseen -- is something that we experience every day. It's about the privacy and the economic security of American families. We rely on the Internetto pay our bills, to bank, to shop, to file our taxes. But we've had to learn a whole newvocabulary just to stay ahead of the cyber criminals who would do us harm: spyware andmalware and spoofing and phishing and botnets. Millions of Americans have been victimized,their privacy violated, their identities stolen, their lives upended, and their walletsemptied. According to one survey, in the past two years alone cyber crime has cost Americansmore than 8 billion dollars. I know how it feels to have privacy violated because it has happened to me and the peoplearound me. It's no secret that my presidential campaign harnessed the Internet andtechnology to transform our politics. What isn't widely known is that during the generalelection hackers managed to penetrate our computer systems. To all of you who donated toour campaign, I want you to all rest assured, our fundraising website was untouched. So yourconfidential personal and financial information was protected. But between August and October, hackers gained access to emails and a range of campaignfiles, from policy position papers to travel plans. And we worked closely with the CIA, with theFBI and the Secret Service, and hired security consultants to restore the security of oursystems. It was a powerful reminder: In this Information Age, one of your greatest strengths-- in our case, our ability to communicate to a wide range of supporters through the Internet - - could also be one of your greatest vulnerabilities. This is a matter, as well, of America's economic competitiveness. The small businesswoman inSt. Louis, the bond trader in the New York Stock Exchange, the workers at a global shippingcompany in Memphis, the young entrepreneur in Silicon Valley -- they all need the networksto make the next payroll, the next trade, the next delivery, the next great breakthrough. E- commerce alone last year accounted for some 132 billion dollars in retail sales. But every day we see waves of cyber thieves trolling for sensitive information -- thedisgruntled employee on the inside, the lone hacker a thousand miles away, organized crime,the industrial spy and, increasingly, foreign intelligence services. In one brazen act last year,thieves used stolen credit card information to steal millions of dollars from 130 ATM machinesin 49 cities around the world -- and they did it in just 30 minutes. A single employee of an American company was convicted of stealing intellectual propertyreportedly worth 400 million dollars. It's been estimated that last year alone cyber criminalsstole intellectual property from businesses worldwide worth up to 1 trillion dollars. In short, America's economic prosperity in the 21st century will depend on cybersecurity. And this is also a matter of public safety and national security. We count on computernetworks to deliver our oil and gas, our power and our water. We rely on them for publictransportation and air traffic control. Yet we know that cyber intruders have probed ourelectrical grid and that in other countries cyber attacks have plunged entire cities intodarkness. Our technological advantage is a key to America's military dominance. But our defense andmilitary networks are under constant attack. Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups have spokenof their desire to unleash a cyber attack on our country -- attacks that are harder to detectand harder to defend against. Indeed, in today's world, acts of terror could come not onlyfrom a few extremists in suicide vests but from a few key strokes on the computer -- aweapon of mass disruption. In one of the most serious cyber incidents to date against our military networks, severalthousand computers were infected last year by malicious software -- malware. And while nosensitive information was compromised, our troops and defense personnel had to give upthose external memory devices -- thumb drives -- changing the way they used theircomputers every day. And last year we had a glimpse of the future face of war. As Russian tanks rolled into Georgia,cyber attacks crippled Georgian government websites. The terrorists that sowed so muchdeath and destruction in Mumbai relied not only on guns and grenades but also on GPS andphones using voice-over-the-Internet. For all these reasons, it's now clear this cyber threat is one of the most serious economic andnational security challenges we face as a nation. It's also clear that we're not as prepared as we should be, as a government or as a country. In recent years, some progress has been made at the federal level. But just as we failed in thepast to invest in our physical infrastructure -- our roads, our bridges and rails -- we've failedto invest in the security of our digital infrastructure. No single official oversees cybersecurity policy across the federal government, and no singleagency has the responsibility or authority to match the scope and scale of thechallenge. Indeed, when it comes to cybersecurity, federal agencies have overlappingmissions and don't coordinate and communicate nearly as well as they should -- with eachother or with the private sector. We saw this in the disorganized response to Conficker, theInternet worm that in recent months has infected millions of computers around the world. This status quo is no longer acceptable -- not when there's so much at stake. We can and wemust do better. And that's why shortly after taking office I directed my National Security Council andHomeland Security Council to conduct a top-to-bottom review of the federal government'sefforts to defend our information and communications infrastructure and to recommend thebest way to ensure that these networks are able to secure our networks as well as ourprosperity. Our review was open and transparent. I want to acknowledge, Melissa Hathaway -- who ishere -- who is the Acting Senior Director for Cyberspace on our National Security Council, wholed the review team, as well as the Center for Strategic and International Studies bipartisanCommission on Cybersecurity, and all who were part of our 60-day review team. They listenedto a wide variety of groups, many of which are represented here today and I want to thank fortheir input: industry and academia, civil liberties and private -- privacy advocates. We listenedto every level and branch of government -- from local to state to federal, civilian, military,homeland as well as intelligence, Congress and international partners, as well. I consultedwith my national security teams, my homeland security teams, and my economic advisors. Today I'm releasing a report on our review, and can announce that my Administration willpursue a new comprehensive approach to securing America's digital infrastructure. This new approach starts at the top, with this commitment from me: From now on, our digitalinfrastructure -- the networks and computers we depend on every day -- will be treated asthey should be: as a strategic national asset. Protecting this infrastructure will be a nationalsecurity priority. We will ensure that these networks are secure, trustworthy and resilient. Wewill deter, prevent, detect, and defend against attacks and recover quickly from anydisruptions or damage. To give these efforts the high-level focus and attention they deserve -- and as part of thenew, single National Security Staff announced this week -- I'm creating a new office here atthe White House that will be led by the Cybersecurity Coordinator. Because of the criticalimportance of this work, I will personally select this official. I'll depend on this official in allmatters relating to cybersecurity, and this official will have my full support and regular accessto me as we confront these challenges. Today, I want to focus on the important responsibilities this office will fulfill: orchestrating andintegrating all cybersecurity policies for the government; working closely with the Office ofManagement and Budget to ensure agency budgets reflect those priorities; and, in the eventof major cyber incident or attack, coordinating our response. To ensure that federal cyber policies enhance our security and our prosperity, myCybersecurity Coordinator will be a member of the National Security Staff as well as the staffof my National Economic Council. To ensure that policies keep faith with our fundamental values, this office will also include anofficial with a portfolio specifically dedicated to safeguarding the privacy and civil liberties ofthe American people. There's much work to be done, and the report we're releasing today outlines a range ofactions that we will pursue in five key areas. First, working in partnership with the communities represented here today, we will develop anew comprehensive strategy to secure America's information and communications networks.To ensure a coordinated approach across government, my Cybersecurity Coordinator will workclosely with my Chief Technology Officer, Aneesh Chopra, and my Chief Information Officer,Vivek Kundra. To ensure accountability in federal agencies, cybersecurity will be designated asone of my key management priorities. Clear milestones and performances metrics willmeasure progress. And as we develop our strategy, we will be open and transparent, which iswhy you'll find today's report and a wealth of related information on our Web site,www.whitehouse.gov. Second, we will work with all the key players -- including state and local governments and theprivate sector -- to ensure an organized and unified response to future cyber incidents. Giventhe enormous damage that can be caused by even a single cyber attack, ad hoc responses willnot do. Nor is it sufficient to simply strengthen our defenses after incidents or attacksoccur. Just as we do for natural disasters, we have to have plans and resources in placebeforehand -- sharing information, issuing warnings and ensuring a coordinated response. Third, we will strengthen the public/private partnerships that are critical to this endeavor. Thevast majority of our critical information infrastructure in the United States is owned andoperated by the private sector. So let me be very clear: My Administration will not dictatesecurity standards for private companies. On the contrary, we will collaborate with industry tofind technology solutions that ensure our security and promote prosperity. Fourth, we will continue to invest in the cutting-edge research and development necessary forthe innovation and discovery we need to meet the digital challenges of our time. And that'swhy my Administration is making major investments in our information infrastructure: layingbroadband lines to every corner of America; building a smart electric grid to deliver energymore efficiently; pursuing a next generation of air traffic control systems; and moving toelectronic health records, with privacy protections, to reduce costs and save lives. And finally, we will begin a national campaign to promote cybersecurity awareness and digitalliteracy from our boardrooms to our classrooms, and to build a digital workforce for the 21stcentury. And that's why we're making a new commitment to education in math and science,and historic investments in science and research and development. Because it's not enoughfor our children and students to master today's technologies -- social networking and e- mailing and texting and blogging -- we need them to pioneer the technologies that will allow us to work effectively through these new media and allow us to prosper in the future. Sothese are the things we will do. Let me also be clear about what we will not do. Our pursuit of cybersecurity will not -- Irepeat, will not include -- monitoring private sector networks or Internet traffic. We will preserve and protect the personal privacy and civil liberties that we cherish asAmericans. Indeed, I remain firmly committed to net neutrality so we can keep the Internet asit should be -- open and free. The task I have described will not be easy. Some 1.5 billion people around the world arealready online, and more are logging on every day. Groups and governments are sharpeningtheir cyber capabilities. Protecting our prosperity and security in this globalized world is goingto be a long, difficult struggle demanding patience and persistence over many years. But we need to remember: We're only at the beginning. The epochs of history are long -- theAgricultural Revolution; the Industrial Revolution. By comparison, our Information Age is stillin its infancy. We're only at Web 2.0. Now our virtual world is going viral. And we've only justbegun to explore the next generation of technologies that will transform our lives in ways wecan't even begin to imagine. So a new world awaits -- a world of greater security and greater potential prosperity -- if wereach for it, if we lead. So long as I'm President of the United States, we will do just that. Andthe United States -- the nation that invented the Internet, that launched an informationrevolution, that transformed the world -- will do what we did in the 20th century and leadonce more in the 21st. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.",obama
"Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  President.  Today,  we  mourn  the  passing  of  Coretta  Scott  King.   And  when  I  think  about  Coretta  Scott  King,  I  think  about  the  little  girl  who  walked  five  miles   to  school  on  those  rural  Alabama  roads  and  felt  the  heat  of  racism  each  day  she  passed  the   door  of  the  Whites  only  school,  so  much  closer  to  home.  It  didn't  matter,  because  she  studied   and  succeeded  and  excelled  beyond  most  of  her  classmates,  Black  and  White.  She  earned  a   college  degree,  and  an  acceptance  to  a  prestigious  graduate  school  up  North.   And  one  day  she  met  a  young  preacher  from  Atlanta,  and  she  fell  in  love  with  him.  And  he   told  her  his  dreams        and  she  believed  in  those  dreams.  And  she  decided  that  she  would  help   to  make  them  real        not  just  as  a  wife  or  as  a  friend,  but  as  a  partner  in  freedom's  cause.   Over  the  next  years,  Coretta  Scott  King  did  that  in  so  many  ways  we  can't  even  imagine.  She   raised  a  family,  she  marched  through  the  streets,  she  inspired  through  song,  she  led  through   speech        even  dodged  the  countless  attempts  on  her  family's  life.  And  when  one  of  those   attempts  finally  took  her  love  from  this  world,  she  made  the  selfless  decision  to  carry  on. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.

Page  1      With  no  time  to  even  cry  or  mourn,  to  wallow  in  anger  or  vengeance,  Coretta  Scott  King  took   to  the  streets  just  four  days  after  the  assassination  and  led  50,000  through  the  streets  of   Memphis  in  a  march  for  the  kind  of  justice  that  her  husband  had  given  his  life  for.  She  spent   the  rest  of  here  marching  for  that  same  justice        leading  the  King  Center  for  Nonviolent   Social  Change  in  Atlanta,  and  spreading  her  family's  message  of  hope  to  every  corner  of  this   world.   You  know,  I  had  the  great  honor  of  knowing  Mrs.  King,  and  the  occasion  to  visit  with  her  in   Atlanta  last  year.  She  was  an  extraordinarily  gracious  woman.  We  sat  and  chatted  in  her  living   room.  She  showed  me  an  album  of  photographs  of  her  and  Dr.  King  and  the  children.  And   then  she  told  me  what  her  husband  had  said  to  her  once,  at  a  time  when  she  was  feeling   burdened,  understandably,  by  all  the  stress  and  strain  that  had  been  placed  on  the  family  as  a   consequence  of  his  role  in  the  Civil  Rights  Movement.   She  said  her  husband  suggested  that:   When  you  are  willing  to  make  sacrifices  for  a  great  cause,  you  will  never  be  alone   because  you  will  have  divine  companionship  and  the  support  of  good  people.   That  was  her  husband's  advice  to  her        that  when  you  are  willing  to  make  sacrifices  for  a   great  cause,  you  will  never  be  alone.   Coretta  Scott  King  died  in  her  sleep  last  night.  She  certainly  was  not  alone.  She  was  joined  by   the  companionship  and  support  of  a  loving  family  and  a  grateful  Nation        inspired  by  her   cause,  dedicated  to  her  work,  and  mournful  of  her  passing.   My  thoughts,  condolences  today  are  with  her  children.   And  I  ask  that  she  and  her  husband  now  rest  together  in  eternal  peace. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.

"Chancellor Merkel and I have just finished our tour here at Buchenwald. I want to thank Dr. VolkhardKnigge, who gave an outstanding account of what we were witnessing. I am particularly grateful to beaccompanied by my friend Elie Wiesel, as well as Mr. Bertrand Herz, both of whom are survivors of thisplace. We saw the area known as Little Camp where Elie and Bertrand were sent as boys. In fact, at the place thatcommemorates this camp, there is a photograph in which we can see a 16-year-old Elie in one of the bunksalong with the others. We saw the ovens of the crematorium, the guard towers, the barbed wire fences, thefoundations of barracks that once held people in the most unimaginable conditions. We saw the memorial to all the survivors -- a steel plate, as Chancellor Merkel said, that is heated to 37degrees Celsius, the temperature of the human body; a reminder -- where people were deemed inhumanbecause of their differences -- of the mark that we all share. Now these sights have not lost their horror with the passage of time. As we were walking up, Elie said, ""ifthese trees could talk."" And there's a certain irony about the beauty of the landscape and the horror thattook place here. More than half a century later, our grief and our outrage over what happened have not diminished. I will notforget what I've seen here today. I've known about this place since I was a boy, hearing stories about my great uncle, who was a very youngman serving in World War II. He was part of the 89th Infantry Division, the first Americans to reach aconcentration camp. They liberated Ohrdruf, one of Buchenwald's sub-camps. And I told this story, he returned from his service in a state of shock saying little and isolating himself formonths on end from family and friends, alone with the painful memories that would not leave his head. Andas we see -- as we saw some of the images here, it's understandable that someone who witnessed whathad taken place here would be in a state of shock. My great uncle's commander, General Eisenhower, understood this impulse to silence. He had seen thepiles of bodies and starving survivors and deplorable conditions that the American soldiers found when theyarrived, and he knew that those who witnessed these things might be too stunned to speak about them orbe able -- be unable to find the words to describe them; that they might be rendered mute in the way mygreat uncle had. And he knew that what had happened here was so unthinkable that after the bodies hadbeen taken away, that perhaps no one would believe it. And that's why he ordered American troops and Germans from the nearby town to tour the camp. He invitedcongressmen and journalists to bear witness and ordered photographs and films to be made. And heinsisted on viewing every corner of these camps so that -- and I quote -- he could ""be in a position to givefirst-hand evidence of these things if ever in the future there develops a tendency to charge theseallegations merely to propaganda."" We are here today because we know this work is not yet finished. To this day, there are those who insistthat the Holocaust never happened -- a denial of fact and truth that is baseless and ignorant and hateful.This place is the ultimate rebuke to such thoughts; a reminder of our duty to confront those who would telllies about our history. Also to this day, there are those who perpetuate every form of intolerance -- racism, anti-Semitism,homophobia, xenophobia, sexism, and more -- hatred that degrades its victims and diminishes us all. In thiscentury, we've seen genocide. We've seen mass graves and the ashes of villages burned to the ground;children used as soldiers and rape used as a weapon of war. This places teaches us that we must be evervigilant about the spread of evil in our own time, that we must reject the false comfort that others' suffering isnot our problem and commit ourselves to resisting those who would subjugate others to serve their owninterests. But as we reflect today on the human capacity for evil and our shared obligation to defy it, we're alsoreminded of the human capacity for good. For amidst the countless acts of cruelty that took place here, weknow that there were many acts of courage and kindness, as well. The Jews who insisted on fasting on YomKippur. The camp cook who hid potatoes in the lining of his prison uniform and distributed them to his fellowinmates, risking his own life to help save theirs. The prisoners who organized a special effort to protect thechildren here, sheltering them from work and giving them extra food. They set up secret classrooms, someof the inmates, and taught history and math and urged the children to think about their future professions.And we were just hearing about the resistance that formed and the irony that the base for the resistancewas in the latrine areas because the guards found it so offensive that they wouldn't go there. And so out ofthe filth, that became a space in which small freedoms could thrive. When the American GIs arrived they were astonished to find more than 900 children still alive, and theyoungest was just three years old. And I'm told that a couple of the prisoners even wrote a Buchenwaldsong that many here sang. Among the lyrics were these: ""...whatever our fate, we will say yes to life, for the day will come when we arefree...in our blood we carry the will to live and in our hearts, in our hearts -- faith."" These individuals never could have known the world would one day speak of this place. They could nothave known that some of them would live to have children and grandchildren who would grow up hearingtheir stories and would return here so many years later to find a museum and memorials and the clock towerset permanently to 3:15, the moment of liberation. They could not have known how the nation of Israel would rise out of the destruction of the Holocaust andthe strong, enduring bonds between that great nation and my own. And they could not have known that oneday an American President would visit this place and speak of them and that he would do so standing sideby side with the German Chancellor in a Germany that is now a vibrant democracy and a valued Americanally. They could not have known these things. But still surrounded by death they willed themselves to hold fast tolife. In their hearts they still had faith that evil would not triumph in the end, that while history is unknowableit arches towards progress, and that the world would one day remember them. And it is now up to us, theliving, in our work, wherever we are, to resist injustice and intolerance and indifference in whatever formsthey may take, and ensure that those who were lost here did not go in vain. It is up to us to redeem thatfaith. It is up to us to bear witness; to ensure that the world continues to note what happened here; toremember all those who survived and all those who perished, and to remember them not just as victims, butalso as individuals who hoped and loved and dreamed just like us. And just as we identify with the victims, it's also important for us I think to remember that the perpetrators ofsuch evil were human, as well, and that we have to guard against cruelty in ourselves. And I want toexpress particular thanks to Chancellor Merkel and the German people, because it's not easy to look intothe past in this way and acknowledge it and make something of it, make a determination that they will standguard against acts like this happening again. Rather than have me end with my remarks I thought it was appropriate to have Elie Wiesel provide somereflection and some thought as he returns here so many years later to the place where his father died.",obama
"Good afternoon. Thank you, President Sarkozy, Prime Minister Brown, Prime Minister Harper,and Prince Charles for being here today. Thank you to our Secretary of Veterans Affairs,General Eric Shinseki, for making the trip out here to join us. Thanks also to SusanEisenhower, whose grandfather began this mission 65 years ago with a simple charge: ""Ok,let's go."" And to a World War II veteran who returned home from this war to serve a proudand distinguished career as a United States Senator and a national leader: Bob Dole. I'm not the first American President to come and mark this anniversary, and I likely will not bethe last. This is an event that has long brought to this coast both heads of state and gratefulcitizens; veterans and their loved ones; the liberated and their liberators. It's been writtenabout and spoken of and depicted in countless books and films and speeches. And long afterour time on this Earth has passed, one word will still bring forth the pride and awe of men andwomen who will never meet the heroes who sit before us: D-Day. Why is this? Of all the battles in all the wars across the span of human history, why does thisday hold such a revered place in our memory? What is it about the struggle that took placeon the sands a few short steps from here that brings us back to remember year after yearafter year? Part of it, I think, is the size of the odds that weighed against success. For three centuries, noinvader had ever been able to cross the English Channel into Normandy. And it had neverbeen more difficult than in 1944. That was the year that Hitler ordered his top field marshal to fortify the Atlantic Wall against aseaborne invasion. From the tip of Norway to southern France, the Nazis lined steep cliffswith machine guns and artillery. Low-lying areas were flooded to block passage. Sharpenedpoles awaited paratroopers. Mines were laid on the beaches and beneath the water. And bythe time of the invasion, half a million Germans waited for the Allies along the coast betweenHolland and northern France. At dawn on June 6th, the Allies came. The best chance for victory had been for the BritishRoyal Air Corps to take out the guns on the cliffs while airborne divisions parachuted behindenemy lines. But all did not go according to plan. Paratroopers landed miles from their mark,while the fog and clouds prevented Allied planes from destroying the guns on the cliffs. Sowhen the ships landed here at Omaha, an unimaginable hell rained down on the men inside. Many never made it out of the boats. And yet, despite all of this, one by one, the Allied forces made their way to shore -- here, andat Utah and Juno; Gold and Sword. They were American, British, and Canadian. Soon, theparatroopers found each other and fought their way back. The Rangers scaled the cliffs. Andby the end of the day, against all odds, the ground on which we stand was free once more. The sheer improbability of this victory is part of what makes D-Day so memorable. It alsoarises from the clarity of purpose with which this war was waged. We live in a world of competing beliefs and claims about what is true. It's a world of variedreligions and cultures and forms of government. In such a world, it's all too rare for astruggle to emerge that speaks to something universal about humanity. The Second World War did that. No man who shed blood or lost a brother would say that waris good. But all know that this war was essential. For what we faced in Nazi totalitarianismwas not just a battle of competing interests. It was a competing vision of humanity. Naziideology sought to subjugate and humiliate and exterminate. It perpetrated murder on amassive scale, fueled by a hatred of those who were deemed different and therefore inferior. It was evil. The nations that joined together to defeat Hitler's Reich were not perfect. They had madetheir share of mistakes, had not always agreed with one another on every issue. Butwhatever God we prayed to, whatever our differences, we knew that the evil we faced had tobe stopped. Citizens of all faiths and of no faith came to believe that we could not remain asbystanders to the savage perpetration of death and destruction. And so we joined and sentour sons to fight and often die so that men and women they never met might know what it isto be free. In America, it was an endeavor that inspired a nation to action. A President who asked hiscountry to pray on D-Day also asked its citizens to serve and sacrifice to make the invasionpossible. On farms and in factories, millions of men and women worked three shifts a day, month aftermonth, year after year. Trucks and tanks came from plants in Michigan and Indiana, NewYork and Illinois. Bombers and fighter planes rolled off assembly lines in Ohio and Kansas,where my grandmother did her part as an inspector. Shipyards on both coasts produced thelargest fleet in history, including the landing craft from New Orleans that eventually made ithere to Omaha. But despite all the years of planning and preparation, despite the inspiration of our leaders,the skill of our generals, the strength of our firepower and the unyielding support from ourhome front, the outcome of the entire struggle would ultimately rest on the success of oneday in June. Lyndon Johnson once said that there are certain moments when ""  history and fate meet at asingle time in a single place to shape a turning point in man's unending search for freedom."" D-Day was such a moment. One newspaper noted that ""we have come to the hour for whichwe were born."" Had the Allies failed here, Hitler's occupation of this continent might havecontinued indefinitely. Instead, victory here secured a foothold in France. It opened a path toBerlin. It made possible the achievements that followed the liberation of Europe: theMarshall Plan, the NATO alliance, the shared prosperity and security that flowed from each. It was unknowable then, but so much of the progress that would define the 20th century, onboth sides of the Atlantic, came down to the battle for a slice of beach only six miles long andtwo miles wide. More particularly, it came down to the men who landed here -- those who now rest in thisplace for eternity, and those who are with us here today. Perhaps more than any otherreason, you, the veterans of that landing, are why we still remember what happened on D- Day. You're why we keep coming back. For you remind us that in the end, human destiny is not determined by forces beyond ourcontrol. You remind us that our future is not shaped by mere chance or circumstance. Ourhistory has always been the sum total of the choices made and the actions taken by eachindividual man and woman. It has always been up to us. You could have done what Hitler believed you would do when you arrived here. In the face ofa merciless assault from these cliffs, you could have idled the boats offshore. Amid a barrageof tracer bullets that lit the night sky, you could have stayed in those planes. You could havehid in the hedgerows or waited behind the seawall. You could have done only what wasnecessary to ensure your own survival. But that's not what you did. That's not the story you told on D-Day. Your story was writtenby men like Zane Schlemmer of the 82nd Airborne, who parachuted into a dark marsh, farfrom his objective and his men. Lost and alone, he still managed to fight his way through the gunfire and help liberate thetown in which he landed -- a town where a street now bears his name. It's a story written by men like Anthony Ruggiero, an Army Ranger who saw half the men onhis landing craft drown when it was hit by shellfire just a thousand yards off this beach. Hespent three hours in freezing water, and was one of only 90 Rangers to survive out of the 225who were sent to scale the cliffs. And it's a story written by so many who are no longer with us, like Carlton Barrett. PrivateBarrett was only supposed to serve as a guide for the 1st Infantry Division, but he insteadbecame one of its heroes. After wading ashore in neck-deep water, he returned to the wateragain and again and again to save his wounded and drowning comrades. And under theheaviest possible enemy fire, he carried them to safety. He carried them in his own arms. This is the story of the Allied victory. It's the legend of units like Easy Company and the All- American 82nd. It's the tale of the British people, whose courage during the Blitz forced Hitlerto call off the invasion of England; the Canadians, who came even though they were neverattacked; the Russians, who sustained some of the war's heaviest casualties on the Easternfront; and all those French men and women who would rather have died resisting tyrannythan lived within its grasp. It is the memories that have been passed on to so many of us about the service or sacrifice ofa friend or relative. For me, it is my grandfather, Stanley Dunham, who arrived on this beachsix weeks after D-Day and marched across Europe in Patton's Army. And it is my great unclewho was part of the first American division to reach and liberate a Nazi concentration camp. His name is Charles Payne, and I'm so proud that he's with us here today. I know this trip doesn't get any easier as the years pass, but for those of you who make it,there's nothing that could keep you away. One such veteran, a man named Jim Norene, wasa member of the 502nd Parachute Infantry Division of the 101st Airborne. Last night, aftervisiting this cemetery for one last time, he passed away in his sleep. Jim was gravely ill whenhe left his home, and he knew that he might not return. But just as he did 65 years ago, hecame anyway. May he now rest in peace with the boys he once bled with, and may his familyalways find solace in the heroism he showed here. In the end, Jim Norene came back to Normandy for the same reason we all come back. Hecame for the reason articulated by Howard Huebner, another former paratrooper who is herewith us today. When asked why he made the trip, Howard said, ""It's important that we tellour stories. It doesn't have to be something big  just a little story about what happened -- sopeople don't forget."" So people don't forget. Friends and veterans, we cannot forget. What we must not forget is that D-Day was a timeand a place where the bravery and the selflessness of a few was able to change the course ofan entire century. At an hour of maximum danger, amid the bleakest of circumstances, menwho thought themselves ordinary found within themselves the ability to do somethingextraordinary. They fought for their moms and sweethearts back home, for the fellowwarriors they came to know as brothers. And they fought out of a simple sense of duty -- aduty sustained by the same ideals for which their countrymen had once fought and bled forover two centuries. That is the story of Normandy -- but also the story of America; of the Minutemen whogathered on a green in Lexington; of the Union boys from Maine who repelled a charge atGettysburg; of the men who gave their last full measure of devotion at Inchon and Khe San;of all the young men and women whose valor and goodness still carry forward this legacy ofservice and sacrifice. It's a story that has never come easy, but one that always gives ushope. For as we face down the hardships and struggles of our time, and arrive at that hourfor which we were born, we cannot help but draw strength from those moments in historywhen the best among us were somehow able to swallow their fears and secure a beachheadon an unforgiving shore. To those men who achieved that victory 65 years ago, we thank you for your service. May God bless you, and may God bless the memory of all those who rest here.",obama
"Good afternoon, everybody. Today I want to start by addressing three issues, and then I'lltake your questions. First, I'd like to say a few words about the situation in Iran. The United States and theinternational community have been appalled and outraged by the threats, the beatings, andimprisonments of the last few days. I strongly condemn these unjust actions, and I join withthe American people in mourning each and every innocent life that is lost. I've made it clear that the United States respects the sovereignty of the Islamic Republic ofIran, and is not interfering with Iran's affairs. But we must also bear witness to the courageand the dignity of the Iranian people, and to a remarkable opening within Iranian society. Andwe deplore the violence against innocent civilians anywhere that it takes place. The Iranian people are trying to have a debate about their future. Some in Iran -- Some in theIranian government, in particular, are trying to avoid that debate by accusing the UnitedStates and others in the West of instigating protests over the election. These accusations arepatently false. They're an obvious attempt to distract people from what is truly taking placewithin Iran's borders. This tired strategy of using old tensions to scapegoat other countrieswon't work anymore in Iran. This is not about the United States or the West; this is about thepeople of Iran, and the future that they -- and only they -- will choose. The Iranian people canspeak for themselves. That's precisely what's happened in the last few days. In 2009, no iron fist is strong enough to shut off the world from bearing witness to peacefulprotests of justice. Despite the Iranian government's efforts to expel journalists and isolateitself, powerful images and poignant words have made their way to us through cell phonesand computers, and so we've watched what the Iranian people are doing. This is what we've witnessed. We've seen the timeless dignity of tens of thousands of Iranians marching in silence. We'veseen people of all ages risk everything to insist that their votes are counted and that theirvoices are heard. Above all, we've seen courageous women stand up to the brutality andthreats, and we've experienced the searing image of a woman bleeding to death on thestreets. While this loss is raw and extraordinarily painful, we also know this: Those who standup for justice are always on the right side of history. As I said in Cairo, suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away. The Iranianpeople have a universal right to assembly and free speech. If the Iranian government seeksthe respect of the international community, it must respect those rights and heed the will ofits own people. It must govern through consent and not coercion. That's what Iran's ownpeople are calling for, and the Iranian people will ultimately judge the actions of their owngovernment.",obama
"Good morning. It is a great honor for me to join you at the New Economic School. Michelle and I are sopleased to be in Moscow. And as somebody who was born in Hawaii, I'm glad to be here in July instead ofJanuary. I know that NES is a young school, but I speak to you today with deep respect for Russia's timelessheritage. Russian writers have helped us understand the complexity of the human experience, andrecognize eternal truths. Russian painters, composers, and dancers have introduced us to new forms ofbeauty. Russian scientists have cured disease, sought new frontiers of progress, and helped us go tospace. These are contributions that are not contained by Russia's borders, as vast as those borders are. Indeed,Russia's heritage has touched every corner of the world, and speaks to the humanity that we share. Thatincludes my own country, which has been blessed with Russian immigrants for decades; we've beenenriched by Russian culture, and enhanced by Russian cooperation. And as a resident of Washington, D.C.,I continue to benefit from the contributions of Russians -- specifically, from Alexander Ovechkin. We're verypleased to have him in Washington, D.C. Here at NES, you have inherited this great cultural legacy, but your focus on economics is no lessfundamental to the future of humanity. As Pushkin said, ""Inspiration is needed in geometry just as much aspoetry."" And today, I want particularly to speak to those of you preparing to graduate. You're poised to beleaders in academia and industry; in finance and government. But before you move forward, it's worthreflecting on what has already taken place during your young lives. Like President Medvedev and myself, you're not old enough to have witnessed the darkest hours of theCold War, when hydrogen bombs were tested in the atmosphere, and children drilled in fallout shelters, andwe reached the brink of nuclear catastrophe. But you are the last generation born when the world wasdivided. At that time, the American and Soviet armies were still massed in Europe, trained and ready tofight. The ideological trenches of the last century were roughly in place. Competition in everything fromastrophysics to athletics was treated as a zero-sum game. If one person won, then the other person had tolose. And then, within a few short years, the world as it was ceased to be. Now, make no mistake: This changedid not come from any one nation. The Cold War reached a conclusion because of the actions of manynations over many years, and because the people of Russia and Eastern Europe stood up and decided thatits end would be peaceful. With the end of the Cold War, there were extraordinary expectations -- for peace and for prosperity; for newarrangements among nations, and new opportunities for individuals. Like all periods of great change, it wasa time of ambitious plans and endless possibilities. But, of course, things don't always work out exactly asplanned. Back in 1993, shortly after this school opened, one NES student summed up the difficulty ofchange when he told a reporter, and I quote him: ""The real world is not so rational as on paper."" The realworld is not so rational as on paper. Over two tumultuous decades, that truth has been borne out around the world. Great wealth has beencreated, but it has not eliminated vast pockets of crushing poverty. Poverty exists here, it exists in the UnitedStates, and it exists all around the world. More people have gone to the ballot box, but too manygovernments still fail to protect the rights of their people. Ideological struggles have diminished, but they'vebeen replaced by conflicts over tribe and ethnicity and religion. A human being with a computer can hold thesame amount of information stored in the Russian State Library, but that technology can also be used to dogreat harm. In a new Russia, the disappearance of old political and economic restrictions after the end of the SovietUnion brought both opportunity and hardship. A few prospered, but many more did not. There were toughtimes. But the Russian people showed strength and made sacrifices, and you achieved hard-earnedprogress through a growing economy and greater confidence. And despite painful times, many in EasternEurope and Russia are much better off today than 20 years ago. We see that progress here at NES -- a school founded with Western support that is now distinctly Russian;a place of learning and inquiry where the test of an idea is not whether it is Russian or American orEuropean, but whether it works. Above all, we see that progress in all of you -- young people with a youngcentury to shape as you see fit. Your lifetime coincides with this era of transition. But think about the fundamental questions asked when thisschool was founded. What kind of future is Russia going to have? What kind of future are Russia andAmerica going to have together? What world order will replace the Cold War? Those questions still don'thave clear answers, and so now they must be answered by you -- by your generation in Russia, in America,and around the world. You get to decide. And while I cannot answer those questions for you, I can speakplainly about the future that America is seeking. To begin with, let me be clear: America wants a strong, peaceful, and prosperous Russia. This belief isrooted in our respect for the Russian people, and a shared history between our nations that goes beyondcompetition. Despite our past rivalry, our people were allies in the greatest struggle of the last century.Recently, I noted this when I was in Normandy -- for just as men from Boston and Birmingham risked all thatthey had to storm those beaches and scale those cliffs, Soviet soldiers from places like Kazan and Kievendured unimaginable hardships to repeal -- to repel an invasion, and turn the tide in the east. As PresidentJohn Kennedy said, ""No nation in history of battle ever suffered more than the Soviet Union in the SecondWorld War."" So as we honor this past, we also recognize the future benefit that will come from a strong and vibrantRussia. Think of the issues that will define your lives: security from nuclear weapons and extremism; accessto markets and opportunity; health and the environment; an international system that protects sovereigntyand human rights, while promoting stability and prosperity. These challenges demand global partnership,and that partnership will be stronger if Russia occupies its rightful place as a great power. Yet unfortunately, there is sometimes a sense that old assumptions must prevail, old ways of thinking; aconception of power that is rooted in the past rather than in the future. There is the 20th century view thatthe United States and Russia are destined to be antagonists, and that a strong Russia or a strong Americacan only assert themselves in opposition to one another. And there is a 19th century view that we aredestined to vie for spheres of influence, and that great powers must forge competing blocs to balance oneanother. These assumptions are wrong. In 2009, a great power does not show strength by dominating or demonizingother countries. The days when empires could treat sovereign states as pieces on a chess board are over.As I said in Cairo, given our independence, any world order that -- given our interdependence, any worldorder that tries to elevate one nation or one group of people over another will inevitably fail. The pursuit ofpower is no longer a zero-sum game -- progress must be shared. That's why I have called for a ""reset"" in relations between the United States and Russia. This must be morethan a fresh start between the Kremlin and the White House -- though that is important and I've hadexcellent discussions with both your President and your Prime Minister. It must be a sustained effort amongthe American and Russian people to identify mutual interests, and expand dialogue and cooperation thatcan pave the way to progress. This will not be easy. It's difficult to forge a lasting partnership between former adversaries, it's hard tochange habits that have been ingrained in our governments and our bureaucracies for decades. But Ibelieve that on the fundamental issues that will shape this century, Americans and Russians share commoninterests that form a basis for cooperation. It is not for me to define Russia's national interests, but I can tellyou about America's national interests, and I believe that you will see that we share common ground. First, America has an interest in reversing the spread of nuclear weapons and preventing their use. In the last century, generations of Americans and Russians inherited the power to destroy nations, and theunderstanding that using that power would bring about our own destruction. In 2009, our inheritance isdifferent. You and I don't have to ask whether American and Russian leaders will respect a balance of terror-- we understand the horrific consequences of any war between our two countries. But we do have to askthis question: We have to ask whether extremists who have killed innocent civilians in New York and inMoscow will show that same restraint. We have to ask whether 10 or 20 or 50 nuclear-armed nations willprotect their arsenals and refrain from using them. This is the core of the nuclear challenge in the 21st century. The notion that prestige comes from holdingthese weapons, or that we can protect ourselves by picking and choosing which nations can have theseweapons, is an illusion. In the short period since the end of the Cold War, we've already seen India,Pakistan, and North Korea conduct nuclear tests. Without a fundamental change, do any of us truly believethat the next two decades will not bring about the further spread of these nuclear weapons? That's why America is committed to stopping nuclear proliferation, and ultimately seeking a world withoutnuclear weapons. That is consistent with our commitment under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Thatis our responsibility as the world's two leading nuclear powers. And while I know this goal won't be metsoon, pursuing it provides the legal and moral foundation to prevent the proliferation and eventual use ofnuclear weapons. We're already taking important steps to build this foundation. Yesterday, President Medvedev and I madeprogress on negotiating a new treaty that will substantially reduce our warheads and delivery systems. Werenewed our commitment to clean, safe and peaceful nuclear energy, which must be a right for all nationsthat live up to their responsibilities under the NPT. And we agreed to increase cooperation on nuclearsecurity, which is essential to achieving the goal of securing all vulnerable nuclear material within four years. As we keep our own commitments, we must hold other nations accountable for theirs. Whether America orRussia, neither of us would benefit from a nuclear arms race in East Asia or the Middle East. That's why weshould be united in opposing North Korea's efforts to become a nuclear power, and opposing Iran's effortsto acquire a nuclear weapon. And I'm pleased that President Medvedev and I agreed upon a joint threatassessment of the ballistic challenges -- ballistic missile challenges of the 21st century, including from Iranand North Korea. This is not about singling out individual nations -- it's about the responsibilities of all nations. If we fail tostand together, then the NPT and the Security Council will lose credibility, and international law will give wayto the law of the jungle. And that benefits no one. As I said in Prague, rules must be binding, violations mustbe punished, and words must mean something. The successful enforcement of these rules will remove causes of disagreement. I know Russia opposes theplanned configuration for missile defense in Europe. And my administration is reviewing these plans toenhance the security of America, Europe and the world. And I've made it clear that this system is directed atpreventing a potential attack from Iran. It has nothing to do with Russia. In fact, I want to work together withRussia on a missile defense architecture that makes us all safer. But if the threat from Iran's nuclear andballistic missile program is eliminated, the driving force for missile defense in Europe will be eliminated, andthat is in our mutual interests. Now, in addition to securing the world's most dangerous weapons, a second area where America has acritical national interest is in isolating and defeating violent extremists. For years, al Qaeda and its affiliates have defiled a great religion of peace and justice, and ruthlesslymurdered men, women and children of all nationalities and faiths. Indeed, above all, they have murderedMuslims. And these extremists have killed in Amman and Bali; Islamabad and Kabul; and they have theblood of Americans and Russians on their hands. They're plotting to kill more of our people, and they benefitfrom safe havens that allow them to train and operate -- particularly along the border of Pakistan andAfghanistan. And that's why America has a clear goal: to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda and its allies inAfghanistan and Pakistan. We seek no bases, nor do we want to control these nations. Instead, we want towork with international partners, including Russia, to help Afghans and Pakistanis advance their ownsecurity and prosperity. And that's why I'm pleased that Russia has agreed to allow the United States tosupply our coalition forces through your territory. Neither America nor Russia has an interest in anAfghanistan or Pakistan governed by the Taliban. It's time to work together on behalf of a different future -- afuture in which we leave behind the great game of the past and the conflict of the present; a future in whichall of us contribute to the security of Central Asia. Now, beyond Afghanistan, America is committed to promoting the opportunity that will isolate extremists.We are helping the Iraqi people build a better future, and leaving Iraq to the Iraqis. We're pursuing the goalof two states, Israel and Palestine, living in peace and security. We're partnering with Muslim communitiesaround the world to advance education, health, and economic development. In each of these endeavors, Ibelieve that the Russian people share our goals, and will benefit from success -- and we need to partnertogether. Now, in addition to these security concerns, the third area that I will discuss is America's interest in globalprosperity. And since we have so many economists and future businessmen and women in the room, I knowthis is of great interest to you. We meet in the midst of the worst global recession in a generation. I believe that the free market is thegreatest force for creating and distributing wealth that the world has known. But wherever the market isallowed to run rampant -- through excessive risk-taking, a lack of regulation, or corruption -- then all areendangered, whether we live on the Mississippi or on the Volga. In America, we're now taking unprecedented steps to jumpstart our economy and reform our system ofregulation. But just as no nation can wall itself off from the consequences of a global crisis, no one canserve as the sole engine of global growth. You see, during your lives, something fundamental has changed.And while this crisis has shown us the risks that come with change, that risk is overwhelmed by opportunity. Think of what's possible today that was unthinkable two decades ago. A young woman with an Internetconnection in Bangalore, India can compete with anybody anywhere in the world. An entrepreneur with astart-up company in Beijing can take his business global. An NES professor in Moscow can collaborate withcolleagues at Harvard or Stanford. That's good for all of us, because when prosperity is created in India,that's a new market for our goods; when new ideas take hold in China, that pushes our businesses toinnovate; when new connections are forged among people, all of us are enriched. There is extraordinary potential for increased cooperation between Americans and Russians. We canpursue trade that is free and fair and integrated with the wider world. We can boost investment that createsjobs in both our countries, we can forge partnerships on energy that tap not only traditional resources, likeoil and gas, but new sources of energy that will drive growth and combat climate change. All of that,Americans and Russians can do together. Now, government can promote this cooperation, but ultimately individuals must advance this cooperation,because the greatest resource of any nation in the 21st century is you. It's people; it's young peopleespecially. And the country which taps that resource will be the country that will succeed. That successdepends upon economies that function within the rule of law. As President Medvedev has rightly said, amature and effective legal system is a condition for sustained economic development. People everywhereshould have the right to do business or get an education without paying a bribe. Whether they are inAmerica or Russia or Africa or Latin America, that's not a American idea or a Russian idea -- that's howpeople and countries will succeed in the 21st century. And this brings me to the fourth issue that I will discuss -- America's interest in democratic governments thatprotect the rights of their people. By no means is America perfect. But it is our commitment to certain universal values which allows us tocorrect our imperfections, to improve constantly, and to grow stronger over time. Freedom of speech andassembly has allowed women, and minorities, and workers to protest for full and equal rights at a time whenthey were denied. The rule of law and equal administration of justice has busted monopolies, shut downpolitical machines that were corrupt, ended abuses of power. Independent media have exposed corruptionat all levels of business and government. Competitive elections allow us to change course and hold ourleaders accountable. If our democracy did not advance those rights, then I, as a person of African ancestry,wouldn't be able to address you as an American citizen, much less a President. Because at the time of ourfounding, I had no rights -- people who looked like me. But it is because of that process that I can now standbefore you as President of the United States. So around the world, America supports these values because they are moral, but also because they work.The arc of history shows that governments which serve their own people survive and thrive; governmentswhich serve only their own power do not. Governments that represent the will of their people are far lesslikely to descend into failed states, to terrorize their citizens, or to wage war on others. Governments thatpromote the rule of law, subject their actions to oversight, and allow for independent institutions are moredependable trading partners. And in our own history, democracies have been America's most enduringallies, including those we once waged war with in Europe and Asia -- nations that today live with greatsecurity and prosperity. Now let me be clear: America cannot and should not seek to impose any system of government on anyother country, nor would we presume to choose which party or individual should run a country. And wehaven't always done what we should have on that front. Even as we meet here today, America supportsnow the restoration of the democratically-elected President of Honduras, even though he has stronglyopposed American policies. We do so not because we agree with him. We do so because we respect theuniversal principle that people should choose their own leaders, whether they are leaders we agree with ornot. And that leads me to the final area that I will discuss, which is America's interest in an international systemthat advances cooperation while respecting the sovereignty of all nations. State sovereignty must be a cornerstone of international order. Just as all states should have the right tochoose their leaders, states must have the right to borders that are secure, and to their own foreign policies.That is true for Russia, just as it is true for the United States. Any system that cedes those rights will lead toanarchy. That's why we must apply this principle to all nations -- and that includes nations like Georgia andUkraine. America will never impose a security arrangement on another country. For any country to becomea member of an organization like NATO, for example, a majority of its people must choose to; they mustundertake reforms; they must be able to contribute to the Alliance's mission. And let me be clear: NATOshould be seeking collaboration with Russia, not confrontation. And more broadly, we need to foster cooperation and respect among all nations and peoples. As Presidentof the United States, I will work tirelessly to protect America's security and to advance our interests. But noone nation can meet the challenges of the 21st century on its own, nor dictate its terms to the world. That issomething that America now understands, just as Russia understands. That's why America seeks aninternational system that lets nations pursue their interests peacefully, especially when those interestsdiverge; a system where the universal rights of human beings are respected, and violations of those rightsare opposed; a system where we hold ourselves to the same standards that we apply to other nations, withclear rights and responsibilities for all. There was a time when Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin could shape the world in one meeting. Those daysare over. The world is more complex today. Billions of people have found their voice, and seek their ownmeasure of prosperity and self-determination in every corner of the planet. Over the past two decades,we've witnessed markets grow, wealth spread, and technology used to build -- not destroy. We've seen oldhatreds pass, illusions of differences between people lift and fade away; we've seen the human destiny inthe hands of more and more human beings who can shape their own destinies. Now, we must see that theperiod of transition which you have lived through ushers in a new era in which nations live in peace, andpeople realize their aspirations for dignity, security, and a better life for their children. That is America'sinterest, and I believe that it is Russia's interest as well. I know that this future can seem distant. Change is hard. In the words of that NES student back in 1993, thereal world is not so rational as on paper. But think of the change that has unfolded with the passing of time.One hundred years ago, a czar ruled Russia, and Europe was a place of empire. When I was born,segregation was still the law of the land in parts of America, and my father's Kenya was still a colony. Whenyou were born, a school like this would have been impossible, and the Internet was only known to aprivileged few. You get to decide what comes next. You get to choose where change will take us, because the future doesnot belong to those who gather armies on a field of battle or bury missiles in the ground; the future belongsto young people with an education and the imagination to create. That is the source of power in this century.And given all that has happened in your two decades on Earth, just imagine what you can create in theyears to come. Every country charts its own course. Russia has cut its way through time like a mighty river through acanyon, leaving an indelible mark on human history as it goes. As you move this story forward, look to thefuture that can be built if we refuse to be burdened by the old obstacles and old suspicions; look to thefuture that can be built if we partner on behalf of the aspirations we hold in common. Together, we can builda world where people are protected, prosperity is enlarged, and our power truly serves progress. And it is allin your hands. Good luck to all of you. Thank you very much.",obama
"I like this. Thank you. Thank you. I think Congress needs one of those horns. That soundspretty good. Sounds like Louis Armstrong back there. Good afternoon, everybody. It is a great honor for me to be in Accra and to speak to the representatives of the people of Ghana. I am deeply grateful for the welcome that I've received, as are Michelle and Malia and Sasha Obama. Ghana's history is rich, the ties between our two countries are strong, and I am proud that this is my first visit to sub- Saharan Africa as President of the United States of America. I want to thank Madam Speaker and all the members of the House of Representatives for hosting us today. I want to thank President Mills for his outstanding leadership. To the former Presidents -- Jerry Rawlings, former President Kufuor -- Vice President, Chief Justice -- thanks to all of you for your extraordinary hospitality and the wonderful institutions that you've builthere in Ghana. I'm speaking to you at the end of a long trip. I began in Russia for a summit between two great powers. I traveled to Italy for a meeting of the world's leading economies. And I've come here to Ghana for a simple reason: The 21st century will be shaped by what happensnot just in Rome or Moscow or Washington, but by what happens in Accra, as well. This is the simple truth of a time when the boundaries between people are overwhelmed by our connections. Your prosperity can expand America's prosperity. Your health and security can contribute to the world's health and security. And the strength of your democracy canhelp advance human rights for people everywhere. So I do not see the countries and peoples of Africa as a world apart; I see Africa as a fundamental part of our interconnected world -- as partners with America on behalf of the future we want for all of our children. That partnership must be grounded in mutualresponsibility and mutual respect. And that is what I want to speak with you about today. We must start from the simple premise that Africa's future is up to Africans. I say this knowing full well the tragic past that has sometimes haunted this part of the world. After all, I have the blood of Africa within me, and my family's -- my family's own storyencompasses both the tragedies and triumphs of the larger African story. Some you know my grandfather was a cook for the British in Kenya, and though he was a respected elder in his village, his employers called him ""boy"" for much of his life. He was on the periphery of Kenya's liberation struggles, but he was still imprisoned briefly during repressive times. In his life, colonialism wasn't simply the creation of unnatural borders or unfair terms of trade -- it was something experienced personally, day after day, year afteryear. My father grew up herding goats in a tiny village, an impossible distance away from the American universities where he would come to get an education. He came of age at a moment of extraordinary promise for Africa. The struggles of his own father's generation were giving birth to new nations, beginning right here in Ghana. Africans were educating and assertingthemselves in new ways, and history was on the move. But despite the progress that has been made -- and there has been considerable progress in many parts of Africa -- we also know that much of that promise has yet to be fulfilled. Countries like Kenya had a per capita economy larger than South Korea's when I was born. They have badly been outpaced. Disease and conflict have ravaged parts of the Africancontinent. In many places, the hope of my father's generation gave way to cynicism, even despair. Now, it's easy to point fingers and to pin the blame of these problems on others. Yes, a colonial map that made little sense helped to breed conflict. The West has often approached Africa as a patron or a source of resources rather than a partner. But the West is not responsible for the destruction of the Zimbabwean economy over the last decade, or wars in which children are enlisted as combatants. In my father's life, it was partly tribalism and patronage and nepotism in an independent Kenya that for a long stretch derailed his career, and we knowthat this kind of corruption is still a daily fact of life for far too many. Now, we know that's also not the whole story. Here in Ghana, you show us a face of Africa that is too often overlooked by a world that sees only tragedy or a need for charity. The people of Ghana have worked hard to put democracy on a firmer footing, with repeated peaceful transfers of power even in the wake of closely contested elections. And by the way, can I say that for that the minority deserves as much credit as the majority. And with improved governance and an emerging civil society, Ghana's economy has shown impressiverates of growth. This progress may lack the drama of 20th century liberation struggles, but make no mistake: It will ultimately be more significant. For just as it is important to emerge from thecontrol of other nations, it is even more important to build one's own nation. So I believe that this moment is just as promising for Ghana and for Africa as the moment when my father came of age and new nations were being born. This is a new moment of great promise. Only this time, we've learned that it will not be giants like Nkrumah and Kenyatta who will determine Africa's future. Instead, it will be you -- the men and women in Ghana's parliament -- the people you represent. It will be the young people brimming with talent and energy and hope who can claim the future that so many in previous generations neverrealized. Now, to realize that promise, we must first recognize the fundamental truth that you have given life to in Ghana: Development depends on good governance. That is the ingredient which has been missing in far too many places, for far too long. That's the change that canunlock Africa's potential. And that is a responsibility that can only be met by Africans. As for America and the West, our commitment must be measured by more than just the dollars we spend. I've pledged substantial increases in our foreign assistance, which is in Africa's interests and America's interests. But the true sign of success is not whether we are a source of perpetual aid that helps people scrape by -- it's whether we are partners in buildingthe capacity for transformational change. This mutual responsibility must be the foundation of our partnership. And today, I'll focus on four areas that are critical to the future of Africa and the entire developing world: democracy,opportunity, health, and the peaceful resolution of conflict. First, we must support strong and sustainable democratic governments. As I -- As I said in Cairo, each nation gives life to democracy in its own way, and in line with its own traditions. But history offers a clear verdict: Governments that respect the will of their own people, that govern by consent and not coercion, are more -- more prosperous, they aremore stable, and more successful than governments that do not. This is about more than just holding elections. It's also about what happens between elections. Repression can take many forms, and too many nations, even those that have elections, are plagued by problems that condemn their people to poverty. No country is going to create wealth if its leaders exploit the economy to enrich themselves -- or -- or if police -- if police can be bought off by drug traffickers. No business -- No business wants to invest in a place where the government skims 20 percent off the top -- or the head of the Port Authority is corrupt. No person wants to live in a society where the rule of law gives way to the rule of brutality and bribery. That is not democracy, that is tyranny, even if occasionally you sprinklean election in there. And now is the time for that style of governance to end. In the 21st century, capable, reliable, and transparent institutions are the key to success -- strong parliaments; honest police forces; independent judges; an independent press; a vibrant private sector; a civil society. Those are the things that give life to democracy,because that is what matters in people's everyday lives. Now, time and again, Ghanaians have chosen constitutional rule over autocracy, and shown a democratic spirit that allows the energy of your people to break through. We see that in leaders who accept defeat graciously -- the fact that President Mills' opponents were standing beside him last night to greet me when I came off the plane spoke volumes about Ghana; victors who resist calls to wield power against the opposition in unfair ways. We see that spirit in courageous journalists like Anas Aremeyaw Anas, who risked his life to report the truth. We see it in police like Patience Quaye, who helped prosecute the first human trafficker in Ghana. We see it in the young people who are speaking up against patronage, andparticipating in the political process. Across Africa, we've seen countless examples of people taking control of their destiny, and making change from the bottom up. We saw it in Kenya, where civil society and business came together to help stop post-election violence. We saw it in South Africa, where over three-quarters of the country voted in the recent election -- the fourth since the end of Apartheid. We saw it in Zimbabwe, where the Election Support Network braved brutalrepression to stand up for the principle that a person's vote is their sacred right. Now, make no mistake: History is on the side of these brave Africans, not with those who use coups or change constitutions to stay in power. Africa -- Africa doesn't need strongmen; itneeds strong institutions. Now, America will not seek to impose any system of government on any other nation. The essential truth of democracy is that each nation determines its own destiny. But what America will do is increase assistance for responsible individuals and responsible institutions, with a focus on supporting good governance -- on parliaments, which check abuses of power and ensure that opposition voices are heard; on the rule of law, which ensures the equal administration of justice; on civic participation, so that young people get involved; and on concrete solutions to corruption like forensic accounting and automating services -- strengthening hotlines, protecting whistle-blowers to advance transparency andaccountability. And we provide this support. I have directed my Administration to give greater attention to corruption in our human rights reports. People everywhere should have the right to start a business or get an education without paying a bribe. We have a responsibility to support those who act responsibly and to isolate those who don't, and that is exactly what America willdo. Now, this leads directly to our second area of partnership: supporting development thatprovides opportunity for more people. With better governance, I have no doubt that Africa holds the promise of a broader base of prosperity. Witness the extraordinary success of Africans in my country, America. They're doing very well. So they've got the talent, they've got the entrepreneurial spirit. The question is, how do we make sure that they're succeeding here in their home countries? The continent is rich in natural resources. And from cell phone entrepreneurs to small farmers, Africans have shown the capacity and commitment to create their own opportunities. But old habits must also be broken. Dependence on commodities -- or a single export -- has a tendency toconcentrate wealth in the hands of the few, and leaves people too vulnerable to downturns. So in Ghana, for instance, oil brings great opportunities, and you have been very responsible in preparing for new revenue. But as so many Ghanaians know, oil cannot simply become the new cocoa. From South Korea to Singapore, history shows that countries thrive when they invest in their people and in their infrastructure; when they promote multiple export industries, develop a skilled workforce, and create space for small and medium-sizedbusinesses that create jobs. As Africans reach for this promise, America will be more responsible in extending our hand. By cutting costs that go to Western consultants and administration, we want to put more resources in the hands of those who need it, while training people to do more for themselves. That's why our 3.5 billion dollar food security initiative is focused on new methods and technologies for farmers -- not simply sending American producers or goods to Africa. Aid is not an end in itself. The purpose of foreign assistance must be creating the conditions where it's no longer needed. I want to see Ghanaians not only self-sufficient infood, I want to see you exporting food to other countries and earning money. You can do that. Now, America can also do more to promote trade and investment. Wealthy nations must open our doors to goods and services from Africa in a meaningful way. That will be a commitment of my Administration. And where there is good governance, we can broaden prosperity through public-private partnerships that invest in better roads and electricity; capacity- building that trains people to grow a business; financial services that reach not just the cities but also the poor and rural areas. This is also in our own interests -- for if people are lifted out of poverty and wealth is created in Africa, guess what? New markets will open up for our owngoods. So it's good for both. One area that holds out both undeniable peril and extraordinary promise is energy. Africa gives off less greenhouse gas than any other part of the world, but it is the most threatened by climate change. A warming planet will spread disease, shrink water resources, and deplete crops, creating conditions that produce more famine and more conflict. All of us -- particularly the developed world -- have a responsibility to slow these trends -- through mitigation, and by changing the way that we use energy. But we can also work with Africans to turn this crisisinto opportunity. Together, we can partner on behalf of our planet and prosperity, and help countries increase access to power while skipping -- leapfrogging the dirtier phase of development. Think about it: Across Africa, there is bountiful wind and solar power; geothermal energy and biofuels. From the Rift Valley to the North African deserts; from the Western coasts to South Africa's crops -- Africa's boundless natural gifts can generate its own power, while exportingprofitable, clean energy abroad. These steps are about more than growth numbers on a balance sheet. They're about whether a young person with an education can get a job that supports a family; a farmer can transfer their goods to market; an entrepreneur with a good idea can start a business. It's about thedignity of work; it's about the opportunity that must exist for Africans in the 21st century. Just as governance is vital to opportunity, it's also critical to the third area I want to talkabout: strengthening public health. In recent years, enormous progress has been made in parts of Africa. Far more people are living productively with HIV/AIDS, and getting the drugs they need. I just saw a wonderful clinic and hospital that is focused particularly on maternal health. But too many still die from diseases that shouldn't kill them. When children are being killed because of a mosquito bite,and mothers are dying in childbirth, then we know that more progress must be made. Yet because of incentives -- often provided by donor nations -- many African doctors and nurses go overseas, or work for programs that focus on a single disease. And this creates gaps in primary care and basic prevention. Meanwhile, individual Africans also have to make responsible choices that prevent the spread of disease, while promoting public health in theircommunities and countries. So across Africa, we see examples of people tackling these problems. In Nigeria, an Interfaith effort of Christians and Muslims has set an example of cooperation to confront malaria. Here in Ghana and across Africa, we see innovative ideas for filling gaps in care -- for instance,through E-Health initiatives that allow doctors in big cities to support those in small towns. America will support these efforts through a comprehensive, global health strategy, because in the 21st century, we are called to act by our conscience but also by our common interest, because when a child dies of a preventable disease in Accra, that diminishes us everywhere. And when disease goes unchecked in any corner of the world, we know that itcan spread across oceans and continents. And that's why my Administration has committed 63 billion dollars to meet these challenges -- 63 billion dollars. Building on the strong efforts of President Bush, we will carry forward the fight against HIV/AIDS. We will pursue the goal of ending deaths from malaria and tuberculosis, and we will work to eradicate polio. We will fight -- we will fight neglected tropical disease. And we won't confront illnesses in isolation -- we will invest in public healthsystems that promote wellness and focus on the health of mothers and children. Now, as we partner on behalf of a healthier future, we must also stop the destruction that comes not from illness, but from human beings -- and so the final area that I will address isconflict. Let me be clear: Africa is not the crude caricature of a continent at perpetual war. But if we are honest, for far too many Africans, conflict is a part of life, as constant as the sun. There are wars over land and wars over resources. And it is still far too easy for those withoutconscience to manipulate whole communities into fighting among faiths and tribes. These conflicts are a millstone around Africa's neck. Now, we all have many identities -- of tribe and ethnicity; of religion and nationality. But defining oneself in opposition to someone who belongs to a different tribe, or who worships a different prophet, has no place in the 21st century. Africa's diversity should be a source of strength, not a cause for division. We are all God's children. We all share common aspirations -- to live in peace and security; to access education and opportunity; to love our families and our communities and our faith. That is ourcommon humanity. That is why we must stand up to inhumanity in our midst. It is never justified -- never justifiable to target innocents in the name of ideology. It is the death sentence of a society to force children to kill in wars. It is the ultimate mark of criminality and cowardice to condemn women to relentless and systemic rape. We must bear witness to the value of every child in Darfur and the dignity of every woman in the Congo. No faith or culture should condone the outrages against them. And all of us must strive for the peace and security necessary forprogress. Africans are standing up for this future. Here, too, in Ghana we are seeing you help point the way forward. Ghanaians should take pride in your contributions to peacekeeping from Congo to Liberia to Lebanon -- and your efforts to resist the scourge of the drug trade. We welcome the steps that are being taken by organizations like the African Union and ECOWAS to better resolve conflicts, to keep the peace, and support those in need. And we encourage the vision of a strong, regional security architecture that can bring effective, transnational forces to bearwhen needed. America has a responsibility to work with you as a partner to advance this vision, not just with words, but with support that strengthens African capacity. When there's a genocide in Darfur or terrorists in Somalia, these are not simply African problems -- they are global securitychallenges, and they demand a global response. And that's why we stand ready to partner through diplomacy and technical assistance and logistical support, and we will stand behind efforts to hold war criminals accountable. And let me be clear: Our Africa Command is focused not on establishing a foothold in the continent, but on confronting these common challenges to advance the security of America, Africa, andthe world. In Moscow, I spoke of the need for an international system where the universal rights of human beings are respected, and violations of those rights are opposed. And that must include a commitment to support those who resolve conflicts peacefully, to sanction and stop those who don't, and to help those who have suffered. But ultimately, it will be vibrant democracies like Botswana and Ghana which roll back the causes of conflict and advance thefrontiers of peace and prosperity. As I said earlier, Africa's future is up to Africans. The people of Africa are ready to claim that future. And in my country, African Americans -- including so many recent immigrants -- have thrived in every sector of society. We've done so despite a difficult past, and we've drawn strength from our African heritage. With strong institutions and a strong will, I know that Africans can live their dreams in Nairobi and Lagos,Kigali, Kinshasa, Harare, and right here in Accra. You know, 52 years ago, the eyes of the world were on Ghana. And a young preacher named Martin Luther King traveled here, to Accra, to watch the Union Jack come down and the Ghanaian flag go up. This was before the march on Washington or the success of the civil rights movement in my country. Dr. King was asked how he felt while watching the birth of anation. And he said: ""It renews my conviction in the ultimate triumph of justice.""1 Now that triumph must be won once more, and it must be won by you. And I am particularly speaking to the young people all across Africa and right here in Ghana. In places like Ghana,young people make up over half of the population. And here is what you must know: The world will be what you make of it. You have the power to hold your leaders accountable, and to build institutions that serve the people. You can serve in your communities, and harness your energy and education to create new wealth and build new connections to the world. You can conquer disease, and end conflicts, and make change from the bottom up. You can dothat. Yes you can -- because in this moment, history is on the move. But these things can only be done if all of you take responsibility for your future. And it won't be easy. It will take time and effort. There will be suffering and setbacks. But I can promise you this: America will be with you every step of the way -- as a partner, as a friend. Opportunity won't come from any other place, though. It must come from thedecisions that all of you make, the things that you do, the hope that you hold in your heart. Ghana, freedom is your inheritance. Now, it is your responsibility to build upon freedom's foundation. And if you do, we will look back years from now to places like Accra and say this was the time when the promise was realized; this was the moment when prosperity was forged, when pain was overcome, and a new era of progress began. This can be the time when we witness the triumph of justice once more. Yes we can. Thank you very much. God bless you. Thank you. 1 King, M.L. (1957). Interview by Etta Moten Barnett.

"Mr. President, I rise today both humbled and honored by the opportunity to express mysupport for renewal of the expiring provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. I want to thank the many people inside and outside Congress who have worked so hard overthe past year to get us here. We owe a great debt of gratitude to the leadership on both sidesof the aisle. And we owe special thanks to Chairmen Sensenbrenner and Specter, RankingMembers Conyers and Leahy, and Representative Mel Watt. Without their work anddedication, and the support of voting rights advocates across the country, I doubt that this billwould have come before us so soon. I want to thank both Chambers and both sides of the aisle, as well, for getting this done withthe same broad support that drove the original act 40 years ago. At a time when Americansare frustrated with the partisan bickering that too often stalls our work, the refreshing displayof bipartisanship we're seeing today reflects our collective belief in the success of the act andreminds us of how effective we can be when we work together. Nobody can deny that we've come a long way since 1965. Look at the registration numbers.Only two years after the passage of the original Act, registration numbers for minority votersin some States doubled. Soon after, not a single State covered by the Voting Rights Act hadregistered less than half of its minority voting age population. Look at the influence of African-American elected officials at every single level of government.There are African-American Members of Congress. Since 2001, our Nation's top diplomat1 hasbeen African American. In fact, most of America's elected African-American officials comefrom States covered by section 5 of the Voting Rights Act -- States like Mississippi, andAlabama, Louisiana, and Georgia. But to me, the most striking evidence of our progress can be found right across this buildingin my dear friend Congressman John Lewis, who was on the front lines of the Civil RightsMovement, risking life and limb for freedom. And on March 7th, 1965, he led 600 peacefulprotesters, demanding the right to vote, across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama.Now, I've often thought about the people on the Edmund Pettus Bridge that day, not onlyJohn Lewis and Hosea Williams, who led the march, but the hundreds of everyday Americanswho left their homes and their churches to join it -- Blacks and Whites, teenagers, children,teachers, bankers, shopkeepers -- what Dr. King called a beloved community of God's childrenready to stand for freedom. And I wonder sometimes -- Where did they find that kind of courage? You know, when you'refacing row after row of State troopers on horseback, armed with billy clubs and tear gas --when they're coming toward you spewing hatred and violence, how do you simply stop, kneeldown, and pray to the Lord for salvation? But the most amazing thing of all is that after that day, after John Lewis was beaten within aninch of his life, after people's heads were gashed open and their eyes were burned, and theywatched their children's innocence literally beaten out of them -- after all that, they went backand marched again. They marched again. They crossed the bridge. They awakened a nation'sconscience. And not five months later the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was signed into law. Itwas reauthorized in 1970, in 1975, and 1982. Now, in 2006 John Lewis, the physical scars of those marches still visible, is an originalcosponsor of the fourth reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act. And he was joined last weekby 389 of his House colleagues in voting for its passage. There were some in the House, and there may be some in the Senate, who argue that the Actis no longer needed, that the protections of section 5's ""preclearance'' requirement"" -- arequirement that ensures certain States are upholding the right to vote -- are targeting thewrong States. Unfortunately, the evidence refutes that notion. Of the 1100 objections issuedby the Department of Justice since 1965, 56 [percent] occurred since the last reauthorizationin 1982. Over half have occurred since 1982. So despite the progress these States have madein upholding the right to vote, it's clear that problems still exist. Now, there are others who would argue that we shouldn't renew section 203's protection oflanguage minorities. These arguments have been tied to debates over immigration and theytend to muddle a noncontroversial issue -- protecting the right to vote -- with one of today'smost contentious debates. But let's remember, you can't request language assistance if you'renot a voter. And you can't be a voter if you are not a citizen. And while voters, as citizens,must be proficient in English, many are simply more confident that they can cast ballotsprinted in their native languages without making errors. It's not an unreasonable assumption. A representative of the Southwestern Voter Registration Project is quoted as saying, (quote): Citizens who prefer Spanish registration cards do so because they feel more connectedto the process. They also feel they trust the process more when they [fully] understandit.2 These sentiments, connection to and trust in our democratic process, are exactly what wewant from our voting rights legislation. Our challenges, of course, don't end at reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act. We have toprevent the problems we've seen in recent elections from happening again. We've seenpolitical operatives purge voters from registration rolls for no legitimate reason, preventeligible ex-felons from casting ballots, distribute polling equipment unevenly, and deceivevoters about the time, location, and rules of elections. And unfortunately, these efforts havebeen directed primarily at minority voters -- the disabled, low-income individuals, and otherhistorically disenfranchised groups. The Help America Vote Act, or HAVA, was a big step in the right direction. But we've got to domore. We need to fully fund HAVA if we're going to move forward in the next stage of securingthe right to vote for every citizen. We need to enforce critical requirements like statewideregistration databases. We need to make sure polling equipment is distributed equitably andequipment actually works. And we need to work on getting more people to the polls onelection day. We need to make sure that minority voters are not the subject of some deplorableintimidation tactics when they do go to the polls. You know, in 2004 Native American voters in South Dakota were confronted by men posing aslaw enforcement. These hired intimidators joked about jail time for ballot missteps andfollowed voters to their cars to record their license plates. [""]In Lake County, Ohio, some voters received a memo on bogus Board of Election[s]letterhead, informing voters who registered through Democratic and NAACP drives that theycould not vote.[""]3 In Wisconsin, a flier purporting to be from the ""Milwaukee Black Voters League"" was circulatedin predominantly African-American neighborhoods with the following message: ""If you'vealready voted in any election this year, you can't vote in the presidential election. ""If youviolate any of these laws, you can get ten years in prison and your children will get takenaway from you.""4 Now, think about that. We've got a lot more work to do. This occasion is a cause forcelebration. But it's also an opportunity to renew our commitment to voting rights. AsCongressman Lewis said last week: It's clear that we've come a great distance, but we stillhave a great distance to go.5,6 Now, the memory of Selma still lives on in the spirit of theVoting Rights Act. Since that day, the Voting Rights Act has been a critical tool in ensuringthat all Americans not only have the right to vote but have the right to have their votecounted. And those of us concerned about protecting those rights can't afford to sit on our laurels uponreauthorization of this bill. We need to take advantage of this rare, united front and continueto fight to ensure unimpeded access to the polls of all Americans. In other words, we need totake the spirit that existed on that bridge, and we have to spread it across this country. You know, two weeks after the first march was turned back, Dr. King spoke, and he told agathering of organizers and activists and community members -- he said that they should notdespair because ""the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice."" The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice. That's because of the workthat each of us do that it bends toward justice. It's because of people like John Lewis andFannie Lou Hamer and Coretta Scott King and Rosa Parks -- all the giants upon whoseshoulders we stand -- that we are beneficiaries of that arc bending toward justice. That's why I stand here today. I would not be in the United States Senate had it not been forthe efforts and courage of so many parents and grandparents and ordinary people who werewilling to reach up and bend that arc in the direction of justice. I hope we continue to see that spirit live on not just during this debate but throughout all ourwork here in the Senate. Thank you, Mr. President.

"Good morning, everybody. Before I introduce America's next Surgeon General, I'd like to saya few words about our ongoing efforts to reform the health care system that she will helpoversee. We are now closer to the goal of health care reform than we have ever been. Over the lastseveral weeks, key committees in the House and the Senate have made important andunprecedented progress on a plan that will lower costs, provide better care for patients, andcurb the worst practices of the insurance companies. It's a plan that will not add to our deficitover the next decade. Let me repeat that: It is a plan that will not add to our deficit over thenext decade -- and eventually will help lower our deficit by slowing the skyrocketing cost ofMedicare and Medicaid. Even though we are close, I've got no illusions that it's going to be easy to get over the finishline. There are going to be more debates and more disagreements before all is said anddone. But health care reform must be done. I know there are those who believe we should wait to solve this problem, or take a moreincremental approach, or simply do nothing. But this is the kind of criticism we heard whenthe country tried to pass Medicare, a program that is now providing quality care togenerations of American seniors. It's the kind of criticism we heard when we tried to pass theChildren's Health Insurance Program, which has provided quality care and coverage to millionsof kids. It's the same Washington thinking that has ignored big challenges and put off toughdecisions for decades. And it is precisely that kind of small thinking that has led us into thecurrent predicament. So make no mistake: The status quo on health care is no longer an option for the UnitedStates of America. If we step back from this challenge right now, we will leave our children alegacy of debt -- a future of crushing costs that bankrupt our families, our businesses, andbecause we will have done nothing to bring down the cost of Medicare and Medicaid, will crushour government. Premiums will continue to skyrocket -- placing what amounts to another taxon American families struggling to pay bills. The insurance companies and special intereststhat have killed reform in the past will only continue to benefit even more -- and they'llcontinue to deny coverage to Americans with pre-existing medical conditions. People willcontinue to lose health insurance just because they lose their job or they change jobs. This is a future that we cannot afford. This country can't afford to have health care premiumsrise three times faster than people's wages, as they did over the last decade. We can't afford14,000 Americans losing their health care every single day. We can't afford a future whereour government will eventually spend more on Medicare and Medicaid than what we spend oneverything else. And during the campaign, I promised health care reform that would control costs, expandcoverage, and ensure choice. And I promised that Americans making $250,000 a year or lesswould not pay more in taxes. These are promises that we're keeping as reform movesforward. This is no longer a problem we can wait to fix. This is about who we are as a country. Healthcare reform is about every family's health, but it's also about the health of the economy. So I just want to put everybody on notice, because there was a lot of chatter during the weekthat I was gone: We are going to get this done. Inaction is not an option. And for those nay- sayers and cynics who think that this is not going to happen, don't bet against us. We aregoing to make this thing happen, because the American people desperately need it. And even those who are satisfied with their health care right now, they understand that ifpremiums keep on doubling and if employers keep on shedding health insurance because it'sunsustainable and if you look at the trajectory of where Medicare and Medicaid are going, theninaction will create the biggest crisis of all. And so I understand people are a little nervous and a little scared about making change. Themuscles in this town to bring about big changes are a little atrophied, but we're whipping folksback into shape. We are going to get this done. And if there's anyone who understands theurgency of meeting this challenge in a personal and powerful way, it's the woman who willbecome our nation's next Surgeon General, Dr. Regina Benjamin. The list of qualifications that make Dr. Benjamin an outstanding candidate to be America'sleading spokesperson on issues of public health are long indeed. She was in the second classat Morehouse School of Medicine and went on to earn an MD from the University of Alabamaat Birmingham and an MBA from Tulane. She served as Associate Dean for Rural Health atthe University of South Alabama College of Medicine, and in 1995, she became the firstphysician under 40 and the first African American woman to be named to the AmericanMedical Association's Board of Trustees. In 2002, she became President of Alabama's StateMedical Association. And she has received numerous awards and recognitions, including theMacArthur Genius Award. It's very impressive. But of all these achievements and experience, none has been more pertinent to today'schallenges or closer to Regina's heart than the rural health clinic that she has built and rebuiltin Bayou La Batre -- did I say that right? Well, tell me how to say it. Dr. Benjamin: Bayou La Batre. President Obama: Bayou La Batre. That's in Alabama, people. Bayou La Batre is a rural town of about 2,500 people. It's a shrimping town, where a lot offolks work for themselves, scrape by, and can't usually afford health insurance. And by theway, Dr. Benjamin, while we were talking in the Oval Office, described for me thedemographics of this town are actually very interesting, because you've got whites, blacks,and Asians in this community. There are a lot of Laotians and Cambodians who have movedthere and are part of this shrimping town, so it's a diverse but very poor rural community. And like so many other rural communities, doctors and hospitals are hard to come by. Andthat's why, even though she could have left the state to make more money as a specialist oras a doctor in a wealthier community, Regina Benjamin returned to Alabama and opened asmall clinic in Bayou La Batre. When people couldn't pay, she didn't charge them. When the clinic wasn't making money,she didn't take a salary for herself. When Hurricane George destroyed the clinic in 1998, shemade house calls to all her patients while it was rebuilt. When Hurricane Katrina destroyed itagain and left most of her town homeless, she mortgaged her house and maxed out her creditcards to rebuild that clinic for a second time. She tended to those who had been wounded inthe storm, and when folks needed medicine, she asked the pharmacist to send the bill herway. And when Regina's clinic was about to open for the third time, and a fire burned it to theground before it could serve the first patient, well, you can guess what Dr. Benjamin did. With help from her community, she is rebuilding it again. One disabled patient brought her anenvelope with $20 inside. Another elderly man said simply, ""Maybe I can help. I got ahammer."" For nearly two decades, Dr. Regina Benjamin has seen in a very personal way what is brokenabout our health care system. She's seen an increasing number of patients who've had healthinsurance their entire lives suddenly lose it because they lost their jobs or because it's simplybecome too expensive. She's been a relentless promoter of prevention and wellnessprograms, having treated too many costly and -- diseases and complications that didn't haveto happen. And she's witnessed the shortage of primary care physicians in the rural andunderserved areas where she works. But for all that she's seen and all the tremendous obstacles that she has overcome, ReginaBenjamin also represents what's best about health care in America -- doctors and nurses whogive and care and sacrifice for the sake of their patients; those Americans who would doanything to heal a fellow citizen. Through floods and fires and severe want, Regina Benjaminhas refused to give up. Her patients have refused to give up. And when we were talking inthe Oval Office, she said: The one thing I want to do is make sure that this Surgeon General'sOffice gives voice to patients, that patients have a seat at the table; somebody is advocatingfor them and speaking for them. And now we in Washington and across America have to refuse to give up on the goal of healthcare that is affordable and accessible for every last one of us. We don't have to deal withhurricanes and we don't have to deal with floods and we don't have to deal with fires; all wehave to do is pass a bill to make sure that the American people have a decent shot at gettingthe kind of choice and high-quality health care that's affordable. And I know that Dr. Benjamin is going to help us get there as the next Surgeon General. AndI am truly honored to nominate her for that post, and Secretary Sebelius is equally excited,even though she's just standing here. With that, let me introduce the next Surgeon General of the United States, Dr. ReginaBenjamin.",obama
"Hello, Michigan! Thank you. Thank you so much. First of all, give Joe a big round of applausefor the wonderful introduction. We've got some special guests here -- now, if everybody haschairs, go ahead and use them. Feel free. We've got some special guests here today that Ijust want to acknowledge. All of you are special, but these folks I want to make sure that youhave a chance to see them. First of all, one of the best governors in the country, please give Jennifer Granholm a biground of applause. Lieutenant Governor John Cherry -- give John a big round of applause. One of my favorite people, a former colleague of mine, still just a fighter on behalf of workingfamilies each and every day -- Senator Debbie Stabenow. We've got Speaker of the House,Andy Dillon, in the house. We've got a lot of other local elected officials, and I just want tothank them. A couple of people who are missing: Carl Levin, who is doing great work. He's in the Senateright now fighting on behalf of a bill to make sure that we're not loading up a bunch ofnecessary defense spending with unnecessary defense spending. So he's the point person onit. The only reason he's not here is because he is working alongside the administration to getthis bill done. Please give him a big round of applause. Congressman Sandy Levin, alsoworking hard on your behalf each and every day, but is not here today. I want to go aheadand acknowledge the new mayor, since he's the new mayor -- Mayor Dave Bing, great ballplayer. My game is a little like Dave Bing's -- except I don't have the jump shot or the speedor the ball handling skills -- or the endurance. Also don't have the afro. Don't think I forgotthat, Dave. I remember. I remember that. I also want to acknowledge that we've got the Executive Director of the White House Councilon Auto Communities and Workers, who's working hard, has a direct line to me each andevery day. He's traveling constantly back here -- Ed Montgomery. Please give Ed a big roundof applause. And the Chairman of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indian Tribe, DerekBailey is here. Please give Derek a big round of applause. And finally, the president of the college where we are here, Jim Jacobs. Give Jim Jacobs a biground of applause. And those of you who I've missed, you know how grateful I am that you're here. And thankyou all. It is wonderful to be back at Macomb. It was terrific visiting this campus as acandidate, but I have to admit, it's even better visiting as a President. Now, this is a place where anyone -- anyone with a desire to learn and to grow, to take theircareer to a new level or start a new career altogether -- has the opportunity to pursue theirdream, right here in Macomb. This is a place where people of all ages and all backgrounds --even in the face of obstacles, even in the face of very difficult personal challenges -- can takea chance on a brighter future for themselves and their families. There are folks like Joe, who just told us his story. When Joe lost his job, he decided to takeadvantage of assistance for displaced workers. He earned his associate degree here atMacomb, and with a pretty impressive GPA, I might add. And with the help of that degree,Joe found a new job, working for the new Henry Ford West Bloomfield Hospital as amaintenance mechanic, using the skills he learned here and the talents that he brought tomake a fresh start. There are workers like Kellie Kulman, who is here today. Where's Kellie? Raise your hand,Kellie. Where are you? There you are. There's Kellie right there. Kellie is a UAW worker at aFord plant in Sterling Heights, Michigan. She used to drive a fork lift, right? But then shedecided to train here at Macomb for a job that required new skills, and now she's anapprentice pipe fitter. It's a telling example: Even as this painful restructuring takes place inour auto industry, workers are seeking out training for new auto jobs. And Joe and Kellie'sstory make clear what all of you know: Community colleges are an essential part of ourrecovery in the present -- and our prosperity in the future. This place can make the futurebetter, not just for these individuals but for America. Now, since this recession began 20 months ago, 6.5 million Americans have lost their jobs,and I don't have to tell you Michigan in particular has been hard-hit. Now, I -- the statisticsare daunting. The whole country now, the unemployment rate is approaching 10 percent. Here in Michigan, it's about five points higher. And new jobs of course are going to be comingout and we're going to see continuing job loss even as the economy is beginning to stabilize. Now, that's not just abstractions. Those just aren't numbers on a page. Those areextraordinary hardships, tough times, for families and individuals who've worked hard all theirlives and have done the right things all their lives. If you haven't lost a job, chances are youknow somebody who has: a family member, a neighbor, a friend, a coworker. And you knowthat as difficult as the financial struggle can be, the sense of loss is about more than just apaycheck, because most of us define ourselves by the work we do. That's part of what itmeans to be an American. We take pride in work -- that sense that you're contributing,supporting your family, meeting your responsibilities. People need work not just for income,but because it makes you part of that fabric of a community that's so important. And so whenyou lose your job, and when entire communities are losing thousands of jobs, that's a heavyburden, that's a heavy weight. Now, my administration has a job to do, as well, and that job is to get this economy back onits feet. That's my job. And it's a job I gladly accept. I love these folks who helped get us inthis mess and then suddenly say, well, this is Obama's economy. That's fine. Give it to me. My job is to solve problems, not to stand on the sidelines and harp and gripe. So I welcome the job. I want the responsibility. And I know that -- let's just take anexample. Many questioned our efforts to help save GM and Chrysler from collapse earlier thisyear. Their feeling was these companies were driven to the brink by poor managementdecisions over a long period of time, and like any business they should be held accountable forthose decisions. I agree that they should be held accountable. But I also recognize thehistoric significance and economic prominence of these companies in communities all acrossMichigan and all across the country. I thought about the hundreds of thousands of Americans whose livelihoods are still connectedto the American auto industry, and the impact on an already struggling economy, especiallyright here in Michigan. So I said that if Chrysler and GM were willing to fundamentallyrestructure their businesses and make the hard choices necessary to become competitive nowand in the future, it was a process worth supporting. Now today, after a painful period of soul-searching and sacrifice, both GM and Chrysler haveemerged from bankruptcy. Remember, folks said there was no way they could do it? They'vegotten it done already, in record time -- far faster than anybody thought possible. They'vegot a leaner structure, they've got new management, and a viable vision of how to competeand win in the 21st century. Those sacrifices were shared among all the stakeholders: workers and management; creditors and shareholders; retirees and communities. Andtogether, they've made the rebirth of Chrysler and GM possible. It was the right thing to do. But even with this positive news, the hard truth is, is that some of the jobs that have beenlost in the auto industry and elsewhere won't be coming back. They're the casualties of achanging economy. In some cases, just increased productivity in the plants themselvesmeans that some jobs aren't going to return. And that only underscores the importance ofgenerating new businesses and new industries to replace the ones that we've lost, and ofpreparing our workers to fill the jobs they create. For even before this recession hit, we werefaced with an economy that was simply not creating or sustaining enough new, well-payingjobs. So now is the time to change all that. What we face is far more than a passing crisis. This isa transformative moment. And in this moment we must do what other generations havedone. It's not the time to shrink from the challenges we face or put off tough decisions. That's what Washington has done for decades, and it's exactly why I ran for President -- tochange that mindset. Now is the time to build a firmer, stronger foundation for growth thatwill not only withstand future economic storms, but that will help us thrive and compete in aglobal economy. To build that foundation, we have to slow the growth of health care coststhat are driving us into debt. We're going to have to do that, and there's going to be a majordebate over the next three weeks. And don't be fooled by folks trying to scare you, saying wecan't change the health care system. We have no choice but to change the health caresystem, because right now it's broken for too many Americans. We're going to have to make tough choices necessary to bring down deficits. But don't letfolks fool you -- the best way to start bringing down deficits is to get control of our health carecosts, which is why we need reform. Now is the time to create the jobs of the future by growing industries, including a new cleanenergy economy. And Jennifer Granholm has been all on top of this as the governor ofMichigan. She is bring cleaning [sic] energy jobs right here to Michigan, and we've got tosupport her in that effort. I want Michigan to build windmills and wind turbines and solar panels and biofuel plants andenergy-efficient light bulbs and weatherize all our -- because, Michigan, you know badweather. So you can be all on top of weatherizing. You need to weatherize. I know aboutthat in Chicago too. But we also have to ensure that we're educating and preparing our people for the new jobs ofthe 21st century. We've got to prepare our people with the skills they need to compete in thisglobal economy. Time and again, when we placed our bet for the future on education, wehave prospered as a result -- by tapping the incredible innovative and generative potential ofa skilled American workforce. That's what happened when President Lincoln signed into lawlegislation creating the land grant colleges, which not only transformed higher education, butalso our entire economy. That's what took place when President Roosevelt signed the GI Billwhich helped educate a generation, and ushered in an era of unprecedented prosperity. Thatwas the foundation for the American middle class. And that's why, at the start of my administration I set a goal for America: By 2020, thisnation will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world. We usedto have that. We're going to have it again. And we've begun to take historic steps to achievethis goal. Already we've increased Pell grants by $500. We've created a $2,500 tax credit forfour years of college tuition. We've simplified student aid applications and ensured that aid isnot based on the income of a job that you just lost. A new GI Bill of Rights for the 21stcentury is beginning to help soldiers coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan to begin a newlife -- in a new economy. And the recovery plan has helped close state budget shortfalls --which put enormous pressure on public universities and community colleges -- at the sametime making historic investments in school libraries and classrooms and facilities all acrossAmerica. So we've already taken some steps that are building the foundation for a 21stcentury education system here in America, one that will allow us to compete with China andIndia and everybody else all around the world. But today I'm announcing the most significant down payment yet on reaching the goal ofhaving the highest college graduation rate of any nation in the world. We're going to achievethis in the next 10 years. And it's called the American Graduation Initiative. It will reformand strengthen community colleges like this one from coast to coast so they get the resourcesthat students and schools need -- and the results workers and businesses demand. Throughthis plan, we seek to help an additional 5 million Americans earn degrees and certificates inthe next decade -- 5 million. Not since the passage of the original GI Bill and the work of President Truman's Commissionon Higher Education -- which helped to double the number of community colleges andincrease by seven-fold enrollment in those colleges -- have we taken such a historic step onbehalf of community colleges in America. And let me be clear: We pay for this plan -- thisisn't adding to the deficit; we're paying for this plan -- by ending the wasteful subsidies wecurrently provide to banks and private lenders for student loans. That will save tens of billionsof dollars over the next 10 years. Instead of lining the pockets of special interests, it's timethis money went towards the interests of higher education in America. That's what myadministration is committed to doing. Now, I know that for a long time there have been politicians who have spoken of training as asilver bullet and college as a cure-all. It's not, and we know that. I can't tell you how manyworkers who've been laid off, you talk to them about training and they say, ""Training forwhat?"" So I understand the frustrations that a lot of people have, especially if the training isnot well designed for the specific jobs that are being created out there. But we know that in the coming years, jobs requiring at least an associate degree areprojected to grow twice as fast as jobs requiring no college experience. We will not fill thosejobs -- or even keep those jobs here in America -- without the training offered by communitycolleges. That's why I want to applaud Governor Granholm for the No Worker Left Behindprogram. It's providing up to two years' worth of free tuition at community colleges anduniversities across the state. The rest of the country should learn from the effort. This is training to become a medical technician, or a health IT worker, or a lab specialist, or anurse. In fact, 59 percent of all new nurses come from community colleges. This is trainingto install solar panels and build those wind turbines we were talking about and develop asmarter electricity grid. And this is the kind of education that more and more Americans areusing to improve their skills and broaden their horizons. Many young people are savingmoney by spending two years at community college before heading to a four-year college. And more workers who have lost their jobs -- or fear losing a job -- are seeking an edge atschools like this one. At the same time, community colleges are under increasing pressure to cap enrollments andscrap courses and cut costs as states and municipalities face budget shortfalls. And this is inaddition to the challenges you face in the best of times, as these schools receive far lessfunding per student than typical four-year colleges and universities. So community collegesare an undervalued asset in our country. Not only is that not right, it's not smart. That's whyI've asked Dr. Jill Biden -- who happens to be a relation of the Vice President, Joe Biden, butwho is also a community college educator for more than 16 years -- to promote communitycolleges and help us make community colleges stronger. And that's why we're putting inplace this American Graduation Initiative. Let me describe for you the specifics of what we're going to do. Number one, we will offercompetitive grants, challenging community colleges to pursue innovative, results-orientedstrategies in exchange for federal funding. We'll fund programs that connect students lookingfor jobs with businesses that are looking to hire. We'll challenge these schools to find newand better ways to help students catch up on the basics, like math and science, that areessential to our competitiveness. We'll put colleges and employers together to createprograms that match curricula in the classroom with the needs of the boardroom. These are all kinds of -- there are all kinds of examples of what's possible. We've seen Cisco,for example, working with community colleges to prepare students and workers for jobsranging from work in broadband to health IT. We know that the most successful communitycolleges are those that partner with the private sector. So we want to encourage morecompanies to work with schools to build these type of relationships. That way, whensomebody goes through a training program, they know that there's a job at the end of thattraining. We'll also create a new research center with a simple mission: to measure what works andwhat doesn't. All too often, we don't know what happens when somebody walks out of aclassroom and onto the factory floor or into the library or -- the laboratory or the office. Andthat means businesses often can't be sure what a degree is really worth. And schoolsthemselves don't have the facts to make informed choices about which programs receive --achieve results and which programs don't. And this is important, not just for businesses andcolleges, but for students and workers, as well. If a parent is going to spend time in theclassroom and away from his or her family -- especially after a long day at work -- thatdegree really has to mean something. They have to know that when they get that degree, this is going to help advance their goals. If a worker is going to spend two years training to enter into a whole new profession, thatcertificate has to mean that he or she is ready, and that businesses are ready to hire. In addition, we want to propose new funding for innovative strategies that promote not justenrollment in a community college program, but completion of that program. See, more thanhalf -- more than half of all students who enter community college to earn an associatedegree, or transfer to a four-year school to earn a bachelor's degree, unfortunately fail toreach their goal. That's not just a waste of a valuable resource, that's a tragedy for thesestudents. Oftentimes they've taken out debt and they don't get the degree, but they still haveto pay back the debt. And it's a disaster for our economy. So we'll fund programs that track student progress inside and outside the classroom. Let'sfigure out what's keeping students from crossing that finish line, and then put in place reformsthat will remove those barriers. Maybe it becomes too difficult for a parent to be away fromhome, or too expensive for a waiter or a nurse to miss a shift. Maybe a young student justisn't sure if her education will lead to employment. The point is, we need to figure outsolutions for these kinds of challenges -- because facing these impediments shouldn't preventyou from reaching your potential. All right, so that's a big chunk of this first part of this initiative. The second part: We're goingto back $10 billion in loans to renovate and rebuild college classrooms and buildings all acrossthe country. All too often, community colleges are treated like the stepchild of the highereducation system; they're an afterthought, if they're thought of at all. And that meansschools are often years behind in the facilities they provide, which means, in a 21st centuryeconomy, they're years behind in the education they can offer. That's a mistake and it's onethat we'll help to correct. Through this fund, schools will have the chance to borrow at a moreaffordable rate to modernize facilities, and they'll be building on the funds in the recovery planthat are already helping to renovate schools, including community colleges all across thecountry. And by the way, not only does this improve the schools and the training that they'reproviding, guess what? You also have to hire some workers and some tradesmen and womento do the work on those schools. So it means it's putting people to work in Michigan righthere right now. Number three: Even as we repair bricks and mortar, we have an opportunity to build a newvirtual infrastructure to complement the education and training community colleges can offer. So we're going to support the creation of a new online, open-source clearinghouse of coursesso that community colleges across the country can offer more classes without building moreclassrooms. And this will make a big difference especially for rural campuses that a lot oftimes have struggled -- attract -- have to struggle to attract students and faculty. And thiswill make it possible for a professor to complement his lecture with an online exercise, or for astudent who can't be away from her family to still keep up with her coursework. We don't know where this kind of experiment will lead, but that's exactly why we ought to tryit because I think there's a possibility that online education can provide especially for peoplewho are already in the workforce and want to retrain the chance to upgrade their skillswithout having to quit their job. So let me say this more: The road to recovery, the road to prosperity, is going to be hard. Itwas never going to be easy. When I was sworn in, we were seeing 700 [thousand] jobs lostthat month. Then we had the same amount lost for two more consecutive months. Nowwe've got an average of about 400,000 jobs lost -- but we're still losing too many jobs. Wewill get to the point where we're not losing jobs, but then we've got to start getting to thepoint where we're actually creating jobs. And it's going to take time. There are going to be false starts and there are going to besetbacks. But I am confident that we can meet the challenges we face, because that's whatwe've always done. That's what America does. We hit some challenges, we fuss and argueabout it, and then we go ahead and go about the business of solving our problems. That'swhat we see on display right here at Macomb Community College. That's what I've seen atcolleges and universities all across this country. At every juncture in our history when we'vebeen challenged, we have summoned the resilience and the industriousness -- that can-doAmerican spirit -- that has allowed us to succeed in the face of even the toughest odds. That's what we can and must do now, not just to overcome this crisis, but to leave somethingbetter behind, to lay a foundation on which our children and our grandchildren can prosperand take responsibility for their future -- just as the students at this school, at this difficultmoment, are taking responsibility for theirs. I am absolutely confident that if I've got your help, that we can make it happen, and we aregoing to see a stronger, more prosperous Michigan in the years to come. Thank you very much, Warren. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.",obama
"Today we say goodbye to the youngest child of Rose and Joseph Kennedy. The world will long remembertheir son Edward as the heir to a weighty legacy; a champion for those who had none; the soul of theDemocratic Party; and the lion of the U.S. Senate -- a man whose name graces nearly one thousand laws,and who penned more than three hundred himself. But those of us who loved him, and ache with his passing, know Ted Kennedy by the other titles he held:Father. Brother. Husband. Uncle Teddy, or as he was often known to his younger nieces and nephews,""The Grand Fromage,"" or ""The Big Cheese."" I, like so many others in the city where he worked for nearlyhalf a century, knew him as a colleague, a mentor, and above all, a friend. Ted Kennedy was the baby of the family who became its patriarch; the restless dreamer who became itsrock. He was the sunny, joyful child, who bore the brunt of his brothers' teasing, but learned quickly how tobrush it off. When they tossed him off a boat because he didn't know what a jib was, six-year-old Teddy gotback in and learned to sail. When a photographer asked the newly-elected Bobby to step back at a pressconference because he was casting a shadow on his younger brother, Teddy quipped, ""It'll be the same inWashington."" This spirit of resilience and good humor would see Ted Kennedy through more pain and tragedy than mostof us will ever know. He lost two siblings by the age of sixteen. He saw two more taken violently from thecountry that loved them. He said goodbye to his beloved sister, Eunice, in the final days of his own life. Henarrowly survived a plane crash, watched two children struggle with cancer, buried three nephews, andexperienced personal failings and setbacks in the most public way possible. It is a string of events that would have broken a lesser man. And it would have been easy for Teddy to lethimself become bitter and hardened; to surrender to self-pity and regret; to retreat from public life and liveout his years in peaceful quiet. No one would have blamed him for that. But that was not Ted Kennedy. As he told us, ""...[I]ndividual faults and frailties are no excuse to give in - andno exemption from the common obligation to give of ourselves."" Indeed, Ted was the ""Happy Warrior"" thatthe poet William Wordsworth spoke of when he wrote: As tempted more; more able to endure, As more exposed to suffering and distress; Thence, also, more alive to tenderness. Through his own suffering, Ted Kennedy became more alive to the plight and suffering of others -- the sickchild who could not see a doctor; the young soldier sent to battle without armor; the citizen denied her rightsbecause of what she looks like or who she loves or where she comes from. The landmark laws that hechampioned -- the Civil Rights Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, immigration reform, children's healthcare, the Family and Medical Leave Act -- all have a running thread. Ted Kennedy's life's work was not tochampion those with wealth or power or special connections. It was to give a voice to those who were notheard; to add a rung to the ladder of opportunity; to make real the dream of our founding. He was given thegift of time that his brothers were not, and he used that gift to touch as many lives and right as many wrongsas the years would allow. We can still hear his voice bellowing through the Senate chamber, face reddened, fist pounding the podium,a veritable force of nature, in support of health care or workers' rights or civil rights. And yet, while hiscauses became deeply personal, his disagreements never did. While he was seen by his fiercest critics as apartisan lightning rod, that is not the prism through which Ted Kennedy saw the world, nor was it the prismthrough which his colleagues saw him. He was a product of an age when the joy and nobility of politicsprevented differences of party and philosophy from becoming barriers to cooperation and mutual respect --a time when adversaries still saw each other as patriots. And that's how Ted Kennedy became the greatest legislator of our time. He did it by hewing to principle, butalso by seeking compromise and common cause -- not through deal-making and horse-trading alone, butthrough friendship, and kindness, and humor. There was the time he courted Orrin Hatch's support for theChildren's Health Insurance Program by having his Chief of Staff serenade the Senator with a song Orrinhad written himself; the time he delivered shamrock cookies on a china plate to sweeten up a crustyRepublican colleague; and the famous story of how he won the support of a Texas Committee Chairman onan immigration bill. Teddy walked into a meeting with a plain manila envelope, and showed only theChairman that it was filled with the Texan's favorite cigars. When the negotiations were going well, he wouldinch the envelope closer to the Chairman. When they weren't, he would pull it back. Before long, the dealwas done. It was only a few years ago, on St. Patrick's Day, when Teddy buttonholed me on the floor of the Senate formy support on a certain piece of legislation that was coming up for vote. I gave him my pledge, butexpressed my skepticism that it would pass. But when the roll call was over, the bill garnered the votes itneeded, and then some. I looked at Teddy with astonishment and asked how he had pulled it off. He justpatted me on the back, and said ""Luck of the Irish!"" Of course, luck had little to do with Ted Kennedy's legislative success, and he knew that. A few years ago,his father-in-law told him that he and Daniel Webster just might be the two greatest senators of all time.Without missing a beat, Teddy replied, ""What did Webster do?"" But though it is Ted Kennedy's historic body of achievements we will remember, it is his giving heart that wewill miss. It was the friend and colleague who was always the first to pick up the phone and say, ""I'm sorryfor your loss,"" or ""I hope you feel better,"" or ""What can I do to help?"" It was the boss who was so adored byhis staff that over five hundred spanning five decades showed up for his 75th birthday party. It was the manwho sent birthday wishes and thank you notes and even his own paintings to so many who never imaginedthat a U.S. Senator would take the time to think about someone like them. I have one of those paintings inmy private study -- a Cape Cod seascape that was a gift to a freshman legislator who happened to admire itwhen Ted Kennedy welcomed him into his office the first week he arrived in Washington; by the way, that'smy second favorite gift from Teddy and Vicki after our dog Bo. And it seems like everyone has one of thosestories - the ones that often start with ""You wouldn't believe who called me today."" Ted Kennedy was the father who looked after not only his own three children, but John's and Bobby's aswell. He took them camping and taught them to sail. He laughed and danced with them at birthdays andweddings; cried and mourned with them through hardship and tragedy; and passed on that same sense ofservice and selflessness that his parents had instilled in him. Shortly after Ted walked Caroline down theaisle and gave her away at the altar, he received a note from Jackie that read, ""On you the carefreeyoungest brother fell a burden a hero would have begged to be spared. We are all going to make it becauseyou were always there with your love."" Not only did the Kennedy family make it because of Ted's love -- he made it because of theirs; andespecially because of the love and the life he found in Vicki. After so much loss and so much sorrow, itcould not have been easy for Ted Kennedy to risk his heart again. That he did is a testament to how deeplyhe loved this remarkable woman from Louisiana. And she didn't just love him back. As Ted would oftenacknowledge, Vicki saved him. She gave him strength and purpose; joy and friendship; and stood by himalways, especially in those last, hardest days. We cannot know for certain how long we have here. We cannot foresee the trials or misfortunes that will testus along the way. We cannot know God's plan for us. What we can do is to live out our lives as best we can with purpose, and love, and joy. We can use eachday to show those who are closest to us how much we care about them, and treat others with the kindnessand respect that we wish for ourselves. We can learn from our mistakes and grow from our failures. And wecan strive at all costs to make a better world, so that someday, if we are blessed with the chance to lookback on our time here, we can know that we spent it well; that we made a difference; that our fleetingpresence had a lasting impact on the lives of other human beings. This is how Ted Kennedy lived. This is his legacy. He once said of his brother Bobby that he need not beidealized or enlarged in death beyond what he was in life, and I imagine he would say the same abouthimself. The greatest expectations were placed upon Ted Kennedy's shoulders because of who he was, buthe surpassed them all because of who he became. We do not weep for him today because of the prestigeattached to his name or his office. We weep because we loved this kind and tender hero who perseveredthrough pain and tragedy -- not for the sake of ambition or vanity; not for wealth or power; but only for thepeople and the country he loved. In the days after September 11th, Teddy made it a point to personally call each one of the 177 families ofthis state who lost a loved one in the attack. But he didn't stop there. He kept calling and checking up onthem. He fought through red tape to get them assistance and grief counseling. He invited them sailing,played with their children, and would write each family a letter whenever the anniversary of that terrible daycame along. To one widow, he wrote the following: As you know so well, the passage of time never really heals the tragic memory of such a great loss,but we carry on, because we have to, because our loved one would want us to, and because thereis still light to guide us in the world from the love they gave us. We carry on. Ted Kennedy has gone home now, guided by his faith and by the light of those he has loved and lost. At lasthe is with them once more, leaving those of us who grieve his passing with the memories he gave, the goodhe did, the dream he kept alive, and a single, enduring image -- the image of a man on a boat; white manetousled; smiling broadly as he sails into the wind, ready for what storms may come, carrying on towardsome new and wondrous place just beyond the horizon. May God Bless Ted Kennedy, and may he rest ineternal peace.",obama
"Hello, everybody! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. All right, everybody goahead and have a seat. How is everybody doing today? How about Tim Spicer? I am here withstudents at Wakefield High School in Arlington, Virginia. And we've got students tuning infrom all across America, from kindergarten through 12th grade. And I am just so glad that allcould join us today. And I want to thank Wakefield for being such an outstanding host. Giveyourselves a big round of applause. I know that for many of you, today is the first day of school. And for those of you inkindergarten, or starting middle or high school, it's your first day in a new school, so it'sunderstandable if you're a little nervous. I imagine there are some seniors out there who arefeeling pretty good right now -- with just one more year to go. And no matter what gradeyou're in, some of you are probably wishing it were still summer and you could've stayed inbed just a little bit longer this morning. I know that feeling. When I was young, my family lived overseas. I lived in Indonesia for afew years. And my mother, she didn't have the money to send me where all the American kidswent to school, but she thought it was important for me to keep up with an Americaneducation. So she decided to teach me extra lessons herself, Monday through Friday. Butbecause she had to go to work, the only time she could do it was at 4:30 in the morning. Now, as you might imagine, I wasn't too happy about getting up that early. And a lot of times,I'd fall asleep right there at the kitchen table. But whenever I'd complain, my mother wouldjust give me one of those looks and she'd say, ""This is no picnic for me either, buster."" So I know that some of you are still adjusting to being back at school. But I'm here todaybecause I have something important to discuss with you. I'm here because I want to talk withyou about your education and what's expected of all of you in this new school year. Now, I've given a lot of speeches about education. And I've talked about responsibility a lot. I've talked about teachers' responsibility for inspiring students and pushing you to learn. I've talked about your parents' responsibility for making sure you stay on track, and you getyour homework done, and don't spend every waking hour in front of the TV or with the Xbox. I've talked a lot about your government's responsibility for setting high standards, andsupporting teachers and principals, and turning around schools that aren't working, wherestudents aren't getting the opportunities that they deserve. But at the end of the day, we can have the most dedicated teachers, the most supportiveparents, the best schools in the world -- and none of it will make a difference, none of it willmatter unless all of you fulfill your responsibilities, unless you show up to those schools,unless you pay attention to those teachers, unless you listen to your parents andgrandparents and other adults and put in the hard work it takes to succeed. That's what Iwant to focus on today: the responsibility each of you has for your education. I want to start with the responsibility you have to yourself. Every single one of you hassomething that you're good at. Every single one of you has something to offer. And you havea responsibility to yourself to discover what that is. That's the opportunity an education canprovide. Maybe you could be a great writer -- maybe even good enough to write a book or articles in anewspaper -- but you might not know it until you write that English paper -- that English classpaper that's assigned to you. Maybe you could be an innovator or an inventor -- maybe evengood enough to come up with the next iPhone or the new medicine or vaccine -- but youmight not know it until you do your project for your science class. Maybe you could be amayor or a senator or a Supreme Court justice -- but you might not know that until you joinstudent government or the debate team. And no matter what you want to do with your life, I guarantee that you'll need an education todo it. You want to be a doctor, or a teacher, or a police officer? You want to be a nurse or anarchitect, a lawyer or a member of our military? You're going to need a good education forevery single one of those careers. You cannot drop out of school and just drop into a good job.You've got to train for it and work for it and learn for it. And this isn't just important for your own life and your own future. What you make of youreducation will decide nothing less than the future of this country. The future of Americadepends on you. What you're learning in school today will determine whether we as a nationcan meet our greatest challenges in the future. You'll need the knowledge and problem-solving skills you learn in science and math to curediseases like cancer and AIDS, and to develop new energy technologies and protect ourenvironment. You'll need the insights and critical-thinking skills you gain in history and socialstudies to fight poverty and homelessness, crime and discrimination, and make our nationmore fair and more free. You'll need the creativity and ingenuity you develop in all yourclasses to build new companies that will create new jobs and boost our economy. We need every single one of you to develop your talents and your skills and your intellect soyou can help us old folks solve our most difficult problems. If you don't do that -- if you quiton school -- you're not just quitting on yourself, you're quitting on your country. Now, I know it's not always easy to do well in school. I know a lot of you have challenges inyour lives right now that can make it hard to focus on your schoolwork. I get it. I know what it's like. My father left my family when I was two years old, and I wasraised by a single mom who had to work and who struggled at times to pay the bills andwasn't always able to give us the things that other kids had. There were times when I missedhaving a father in my life. There were times when I was lonely and I felt like I didn't fit in. So I wasn't always as focused as I should have been on school, and I did some things I'm notproud of, and I got in more trouble than I should have. And my life could have easily taken aturn for the worse. But I was -- I was lucky. I got a lot of second chances, and I had the opportunity to go tocollege and law school and follow my dreams. My wife, our First Lady Michelle Obama, she hasa similar story. Neither of her parents had gone to college, and they didn't have a lot ofmoney. But they worked hard, and she worked hard, so that she could go to the best schoolsin this country. Some of you might not have those advantages. Maybe you don't have adults in your life whogive you the support that you need. Maybe someone in your family has lost their job andthere's not enough money to go around. Maybe you live in a neighborhood where you don'tfeel safe, or have friends who are pressuring you to do things you know aren't right. But at the end of the day, the circumstances of your life -- what you look like, where youcome from, how much money you have, what you've got going on at home -- none of that isan excuse for neglecting your homework or having a bad attitude in school. That's no excusefor talking back to your teacher, or cutting class, or dropping out of school. There is no excusefor not trying. Where you are right now doesn't have to determine where you'll end up. No one's written yourdestiny for you, because here in America, you write your own destiny. You make your ownfuture. That's what young people like you are doing every day, all across America. Young people like Jazmin Perez, from Roma, Texas. Jazmin didn't speak English when she firststarted school. Neither of her parents had gone to college. But she worked hard, earned goodgrades, and got a scholarship to Brown University -- is now in graduate school, studyingpublic health, on her way to becoming Dr. Jazmin Perez. I'm thinking about Andoni Schultz, from Los Altos, California, who's fought brain cancer sincehe was three. He's had to endure all sorts of treatments and surgeries, one of which affectedhis memory, so it took him much longer -- hundreds of extra hours -- to do his schoolwork.But he never fell behind. He's headed to college this fall. And then there's Shantell Steve, from my hometown of Chicago, Illinois. Even when bouncingfrom foster home to foster home in the toughest neighborhoods in the city, she managed toget a job at a local health care center, start a program to keep young people out of gangs,and she's on track to graduate high school with honors and go on to college. And Jazmin, Andoni, and Shantell aren't any different from any of you. They face challenges intheir lives just like you do. In some cases they've got it a lot worse off than many of you. Butthey refused to give up. They chose to take responsibility for their lives, for their education,and set goals for themselves. And I expect all of you to do the same. That's why today I'm calling on each of you to set your own goals for your education -- and doeverything you can to meet them. Your goal can be something as simple as doing all yourhomework, paying attention in class, or spending some time each day reading a book. Maybeyou'll decide to get involved in an extracurricular activity, or volunteer in your community.Maybe you'll decide to stand up for kids who are being teased or bullied because of who theyare or how they look, because you believe, like I do, that all young people deserve a safeenvironment to study and learn. Maybe you'll decide to take better care of yourself so you canbe more ready to learn. And along those lines, by the way, I hope all of you are washing yourhands a lot, and that you stay home from school when you don't feel well, so we can keeppeople from getting the flu this fall and winter. But whatever you resolve to do, I want you to commit to it. I want you to really work at it. I know that sometimes you get that sense from TV that you can be rich and successfulwithout any hard work -- that your ticket to success is through rapping or basketball or beinga reality TV star. Chances are you're not going to be any of those things. The truth is, being successful is hard. You won't love every subject that you study. You won'tclick with every teacher that you have. Not every homework assignment will seem completelyrelevant to your life right at this minute. And you won't necessarily succeed at everything thefirst time you try. That's okay. Some of the most successful people in the world are the ones who've had themost failures. J.K. Rowling's -- who wrote Harry Potter -- her first Harry Potter book wasrejected 12 times before it was finally published. Michael Jordan was cut from his high schoolbasketball team. He lost hundreds of games and missed thousands of shots during his career.But he once said, ""I have failed over and over and over again in my life. And that's why Isucceed."" These people succeeded because they understood that you can't let your failures define you --you have to let your failures teach you. You have to let them show you what to do differentlythe next time. So if you get into trouble, that doesn't mean you're a troublemaker, it meansyou need to try harder to act right. If you get a bad grade, that doesn't mean you're stupid, itjust means you need to spend more time studying. No one's born being good at all things. You become good at things through hard work. You'renot a varsity athlete the first time you play a new sport. You don't hit every note the first timeyou sing a song. You've got to practice. The same principle applies to your schoolwork. Youmight have to do a math problem a few times before you get it right. You might have to readsomething a few times before you understand it. You definitely have to do a few drafts of apaper before it's good enough to hand in. Don't be afraid to ask questions. Don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it. I do thatevery day. Asking for help isn't a sign of weakness, it's a sign of strength because it showsyou have the courage to admit when you don't know something, and that then allows you tolearn something new. So find an adult that you trust -- a parent, a grandparent or teacher, acoach or a counselor -- and ask them to help you stay on track to meet your goals. And even when you're struggling, even when you're discouraged, and you feel like otherpeople have given up on you, don't ever give up on yourself, because when you give up onyourself, you give up on your country. The story of America isn't about people who quit when things got tough. It's about people whokept going, who tried harder, who loved their country too much to do anything less than theirbest. It's the story of students who sat where you sit 250 years ago, and went on to wage arevolution and they founded this nation. Young people. Students who sat where you sit 75years ago who overcame a Depression and won a world war; who fought for civil rights andput a man on the moon. Students who sat where you sit 20 years ago who founded Googleand Twitter and Facebook and changed the way we communicate with each other. So today, I want to ask all of you, what's your contribution going to be? What problems areyou going to solve? What discoveries will you make? What will a President who comes here in20 or 50 or 100 years say about what all of you did for this country? Now, your families, your teachers, and I are doing everything we can to make sure you havethe education you need to answer these questions. I'm working hard to fix up your classroomsand get you the books and the equipment and the computers you need to learn. But you'vegot to do your part, too. So I expect all of you to get serious this year. I expect you to putyour best effort into everything you do. I expect great things from each of you. So don't let usdown. Don't let your family down or your country down. Most of all, don't let yourself down.Make us all proud. Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. God bless America. Thank you.",obama
"To Chip, Kathy, and Nancy, who graciously shared your father with a nation that loved him; toWalter's friends, colleagues, prot  g  s, and all who considered him a hero; to the men of theIntrepid; to all of you who are gathered here today; I am honored to be here to pay tribute tothe life and times of the man who chronicled our time. I did not know Mr. Cronkite personally. And my regret is made more acute by the stories thathave been shared here today. Nor, for that matter, did I know him any better than the tens ofmillions who turned to him each night in search of the answer to a simple question: ""Whathappened today?"" But like them and like all of you, I have benefited as a citizen from hisdogged pursuit of the truth, his passionate defense of objective reporting, and his view thatjournalism is more than just a profession; it is a public good vital to our democracy. Even in his early career, Walter Cronkite resisted the temptation to get the story first in favorof getting it right. He wanted to get it first, but he understood the importance of getting itright. During one of his first jobs in Kansas City, Walter's program manager urged him to goon the air reporting a massive blaze -- and we just heard how much he loved fires -- amassive blaze at city hall that had already claimed lives. When Walter reached for thetelephone, his boss asked, ""What are you doing; get on the air!"" Walter replied that he wascalling the fire department to confirm the story. ""You don't need to confirm it,"" the managershouted, ""My wife is watching the whole thing!"" Needless to say, Walter made the call, and even as the program manager took to the airhimself to broadcast the unfolding tragedy, Walter discovered that it had been nothing morethan a small fire that hadn't resulted in any injuries. He lost his job -- but he got the storyright. Walter wasn't afraid to rattle the high and the mighty, either; but he never dared tocompromise his integrity. He got along with elected officials, even if they were wary of oneanother's motives. One politician once remarked, ""Walter, my friend, you've got to believeme, fully 85 percent of everything I told you today is the absolute truth."" He shared a complicated relationship with Presidents of both parties, who wanted him on theirside even as they were convinced that he wasn't. President Johnson called Walter after theevening news from time to time to voice his displeasure over a certain story. But Walter knewthat if he was receiving vociferous complaints from both sides, he must be doing his job. His endless inquisitiveness about our world, I can imagine, came from a mother who soldencyclopedias for a living. As a boy, Walter spent countless hours getting lost within theirpages, endlessly sidetracked by new and interesting entries that branched off from oneanother, fascinated by the world around us and how it worked. And that's the way he lived his life -- with curiosity, exploring our planet, seeking to makesense of it and explaining it to others. He went everywhere and he did everything. He racedcars and boats; he traveled everywhere from the Amazon to the Arctic; he plunged 8,000 feetbelow the sea, trekked 18,000 feet up into the Himalayas, and experienced weightlessness inthe upper reaches of our atmosphere -- all with one mission: to make it come alive for therest of us. And as our world began to change, he helped us understand those changes. He was foreverthere, reporting through world war and cold war; marches and milestones; scandal andsuccess; calmly and authoritatively telling us what we needed to know. He was a voice ofcertainty in a world that was growing more and more uncertain. And through it all, he neverlost the integrity or the plainspoken speaking style that he gained growing up in theheartland. He was a familiar and welcome voice that spoke to each and every one of uspersonally. So it may have seemed inevitable that he was named the most trusted man in America. Buthere's the thing: That title wasn't bestowed on him by a network. We weren't told to believeit by some advertising campaign. It was earned. It was earned by year after year anddecade after decade of painstaking effort; a commitment to fundamental values; his beliefthat the American people were hungry for the truth, unvarnished and unaccompanied bytheatre or spectacle. He didn't believe in dumbing down. He trusted us. When he was told of this extraordinary honor that he was the most trusted man in America,he naturally downplayed it by saying the people had not polled his wife. When people of bothpolitical parties actually tried to recruit him to run for office, without even asking for hisstances on the issues, he said no -- to the relief of all potential opponents. And when, even adecade and a half after his retirement, he still ranked first in seven of eight categories fortelevision journalists, he was disbelieving that he hadn't won the eighth category,""attractiveness."" Through all the events that came to define the 20th century, through all our moments ofdeepest hurt and brightest hope, Walter Cronkite was there, telling the story of the Americanage. And this is how we remember him today. But we also remember and celebrate the journalismthat Walter practiced -- a standard of honesty and integrity and responsibility to which somany of you have committed your careers. It's a standard that's a little bit harder to findtoday. We know that this is a difficult time for journalism. Even as appetites for news andinformation grow, newsrooms are closing. Despite the big stories of our era, seriousjournalists find themselves all too often without a beat. Just as the news cycle has shrunk, sohas the bottom line. And too often, we fill that void with instant commentary and celebrity gossip and the softerstories that Walter disdained, rather than the hard news and investigative journalism hechampioned. ""What happened today?"" is replaced with ""Who won today?"" The public debatecheapens. The public trust falters. We fail to understand our world or one another as well aswe should    - and that has real consequences in our own lives and in the life of our nation. Weseem stuck with a choice between what cuts to our bottom line and what harms us as asociety. Which price is higher to pay? Which cost is harder to bear? ""This democracy,"" Walter said, ""cannot function without a reasonably well-informedelectorate."" That's why the honest, objective, meticulous reporting that so many of youpursue with the same zeal that Walter did is so vital to our democracy and our society: Ourfuture depends on it. Walter was no naive idealist. He understood the challenges and the pressures and thetemptations facing journalism in this new era. He believed that a media company has anobligation to pursue a profit, but also an obligation to invest a good chunk of that profit backinto news and public affairs. He was excited about all the stories that a high-tech world ofjournalism would be able to tell, and all the newly-emerging means with which to tell it. Naturally, we find ourselves wondering how he would have covered the monumental stories ofour time. In an era where the news that city hall is on fire can sweep around the world at thespeed of the Internet, would he still have called to double-check? Would he have been able to cut through the murky noise of the blogs and the tweets and thesound bites to shine the bright light on substance? Would he still offer the perspective thatwe value? Would he have been able to remain a singular figure in an age of dwindlingattention spans and omnipresent media? And somehow, we know that the answer is yes. The simple values Walter Cronkite set out inpursuit of -- to seek the truth, to keep us honest, to explore our world the best he could --they are as vital today as they ever were. Our American story continues. It needs to be told. And if we choose to live up to Walter'sexample, if we realize that the kind of journalism he embodied will not simply rekindle itself aspart of a natural cycle, but will come alive only if we stand up and demand it and resolve tovalue it once again, then I'm convinced that the choice between profit and progress is a falseone -- and that the golden days of journalism still lie ahead. Walter Cronkite invited a nation to believe in him -- and he never betrayed that trust. That'swhy so many of you entered the profession in the first place. That's why the standards he setfor journalists still stand. And that's why he loved and valued all of you, but we loved andvalued Walter not only as the rarest of men, but as an indispensable pillar of our society. He's reunited with his beloved Betsy now, watching the stories of this century unfold withboundless optimism -- every so often punctuating the air with a gleeful ""Oh, boy!"" We aregrateful to him for altering and illuminating our time, and for the opportunity he gave to us tosay that, yes, we, too, were there. Thank you very much.",obama
"Eight Septembers have come and gone. Nearly 3,000 days have passed -- almost one for each of thosetaken from us. But no turning of the seasons can diminish the pain and the loss of that day. No passage oftime and no dark skies can ever dull the meaning of this moment. So on this solemn day, at this sacred hour, once more we pause. Once more we pray -- as a nation and asa people; in city streets where our two towers were turned to ashes and dust; in a quiet field where a planefell from the sky; and here, where a single stone of this building is still blackened by the fires. We remember with reverence the lives we lost. We read their names. We press their photos to our hearts.And on this day that marks their death, we recall the beauty and meaning of their lives; men and women andchildren of every color and every creed, from across our nation and from more than 100 others. They wereinnocent. Harming no one, they went about their daily lives. Gone in a horrible instant, they now ""dwell in theHouse of the Lord forever."" We honor all those who gave their lives so that others might live, and all the survivors who battled burns andwounds and helped each other rebuild their lives; men and women who gave life to that most simple ofrules: I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper. We pay tribute to the service of a new generation -- young Americans raised in a time of peace and plentywho saw their nation in its hour of need and said, ""I choose to serve""; ""I will do my part."" And once more wegrieve. For you and your families, no words can ease the ache of your heart. No deeds can fill the emptyplaces in your homes. But on this day and all that follow, you may find solace in the memory of those youloved, and know that you have the unending support of the American people. Scripture teaches us a hard truth. The mountains may fall and the earth may give way; the flesh and theheart may fail. But after all our suffering, God and grace will ""restore you and make you strong, firm andsteadfast."" So it is -- so it has been for these families. So it must be for our nation. Let us renew our resolve against those who perpetrated this barbaric act and who plot against us still. Indefense of our nation we will never waver; in pursuit of al Qaeda and its extremist allies, we will never falter. Let us renew our commitment to all those who serve in our defense -- our courageous men and women inuniform and their families and all those who protect us here at home. Mindful that the work of protectingAmerica is never finished, we will do everything in our power to keep America safe. Let us renew the true spirit of that day. Not the human capacity for evil, but the human capacity for good.Not the desire to destroy, but the impulse to save, and to serve, and to build. On this first National Day ofService and Remembrance, we can summon once more that ordinary goodness of America -- to serve ourcommunities, to strengthen our country, and to better our world. Most of all, on a day when others sought to sap our confidence, let us renew our common purpose. Let usremember how we came together as one nation, as one people, as Americans, united not only in our grief,but in our resolve to stand with one another, to stand up for the country we all love. This may be the greatest lesson of this day, the strongest rebuke to those who attacked us, the highesttribute to those taken from us -- that such sense of purpose need not be a fleeting moment. It can be alasting virtue.For through their own lives -- and through you, the loved ones that they left behind -- the men and womenwho lost their lives eight years ago today leave a legacy that still shines brightly in the darkness, and thatcalls on all of us to be strong and firm and united. That is our calling today and in all the Septembers still tocome. May God bless you and comfort you. And may God bless the United States of America.",obama
"To the Fort Hood community; to Admiral Mullen; General Casey; General Cone; SecretaryMcHugh; Secretary Gates; most importantly, to family, friends, and members of our ArmedForces: We come together filled with sorrow for the 13 Americans that we have lost, withgratitude for the lives that they led, and with a determination to honor them through the workwe carry on. This is a time of war. Yet these Americans did not die on a foreign field of battle. They werekilled here, on American soil, in the heart of this great state and the heart of this greatAmerican community. This is the fact that makes the tragedy even more painful, even moreincomprehensible. For those families who have lost a loved one, no words can fill the void that's been left. Weknew these men and women as soldiers and caregivers. You knew them as mothers andfathers, sons and daughters, sisters and brothers. But here is what you must also know: Your loved ones endure through the life of our nation. Their memory will be honored in the places they lived and by the people they touched. Theirlife's work is our security, and the freedom that we all too often take for granted. Everyevening that the sun sets on a tranquil town; every dawn that a flag is unfurled; everymoment that an American enjoys life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness -- that is theirlegacy. Neither this country, nor the values upon which we were founded, could exist without menand women like these 13 Americans. And that is why we must pay tribute to their stories. Chief Warrant Officer Michael Cahill had served in the National Guard and worked as aphysician's assistant for decades. A husband and father of three, he was so committed to hispatients that on the day he died he was back at work just weeks after having had a heartattack. Major Libardo Eduardo Caraveo spoke little English when he came to America as ateenager. But he put himself through college, earned a Ph.D., and was helping combat unitscope with the stress of deployment. He's survived by his wife, sons, and step-daughters. Staff Sergeant Justin DeCrow joined the Army right after high school, married his high schoolsweetheart, and had served as a light wheeled mechanic and satellite communicationsoperator. He was known as an optimist, a mentor, and a loving husband and loving father. After retiring from the Army as a major, John Gaffaney cared for society's most vulnerableduring two decades as a psychiatric nurse. He spent three years trying to return to active dutyin this time of war, and he was preparing to deploy to Iraq as a captain. He leaves behind awife and son. Specialist Frederick Greene was a Tennessean who wanted to join the Army for a long time,and did so in 2008, with the support of his family. As a combat engineer he was a naturalleader, and he is survived by his wife and two daughters. Specialist Jason Hunt was also recently married, with three children to care for. He joined theArmy after high school. He did a tour in Iraq, and it was there that he reenlisted for six moreyears on his 21st birthday so that he could continue to serve. Staff Sergeant Amy Krueger was an athlete in high school, joined the Army shortly after 9/11,and had since returned home to speak to students about her experience. When her mothertold her she couldn't take on Osama bin Laden by herself, Amy replied: ""Watch me."" Private First Class Aaron Nemelka was an Eagle Scout who just recently signed up to do one ofthe most dangerous jobs in the service -- diffuse bombs -- so that he could help save lives. Hewas proudly carrying on a tradition of military service that runs deep within his family. Private First Class Michael Pearson loved his family and loved his music, and his goal was tobe a music teacher. He excelled at playing the guitar, and could create songs on the spot andshow others how to play. He joined the military a year ago, and was preparing for his firstdeployment. Captain Russell Seager worked as a nurse for the VA, helping veterans with Post-TraumaticStress. He had extraordinary respect for the military, and signed up to serve so that he couldhelp soldiers cope with the stress of combat and return to civilian life. He leaves behind a wifeand son.

When she waskilled she was pregnant with her first child, and was excited about becoming a mother. Lieutenant Colonel Juanita Warman was the daughter and granddaughter of Armyveterans. She was a single mom who put herself through college and graduate school, andserved as a nurse practitioner while raising her two daughters. She also left behind a lovinghusband. Private First Class Kham Xiong came to America from Thailand as a small child. He was ahusband and father who followed his brother into the military because his family had a stronghistory of service. He was preparing for his first deployment to Afghanistan. These men and women came from all parts of the country. Some had long careers in themilitary. Some had signed up to serve in the shadow of 9/11. Some had known intensecombat in Iraq and Afghanistan, and some cared for those did. Their lives speak to thestrength, the dignity, the decency of those who serve, and that's how they will beremembered. For that same spirit is embodied in the community here at Fort Hood, and in the manywounded who are still recovering. As was already mentioned, in those terrible minutes duringthe attack, soldiers made makeshift tourniquets out of their clothes. They braved gunfire toreach the wounded, and ferried them back to safety in the backs of cars and a pickup truck. One young soldier, Amber Bahr, was so intent on helping others, she did not realize for sometime that she, herself, had been shot in the back. Two police officers -- Mark Todd and KimMunley -- saved countless lives by risking their own. One medic -- Francisco de la Serna --treated both Officer Munley and the gunman who shot her. It may be hard to comprehend the twisted logic that led to this tragedy. But this much we doknow: No faith justifies these murderous and craven acts. No just and loving God looks uponthem with favor. For what he has done, we know that the killer will be met with justice -- inthis world, and the next. These are trying times for our country. In Afghanistan and Pakistan, the same extremists whokilled nearly 3,000 Americans continue to endanger America, our allies, and innocent Afghansand Pakistanis. In Iraq, we're working to bring a war to a successful end, as there are still those who woulddeny the Iraqi people the future that Americans and Iraqis have sacrificed so much for. As we face these challenges, the stories of those at Fort Hood reaffirm the core values that weare fighting for, and the strength that we must draw upon. Theirs are the tales of Americanmen and women answering an extraordinary call -- the call to serve their comrades, theircommunities, and their country. In an age of self -- selfishness, they embody responsibility. Inan era of division, they call upon us to come together. In a time of cynicism, they remind usof who we are as Americans. We are a nation that endures because of the courage of those who defend it. We saw thatvalor in those who braved bullets here at Fort Hood, just as surely as we see it in those whosigned up knowing they would serve in harm   s way. We are a nation of laws whose commitment to justice is so enduring that we would treat agunman and give him due process, just as surely as we will see that he pays for his crimes. We're a nation that guarantees the freedom to worship as one chooses. And instead ofclaiming God for our side, we remember Lincoln   s words, and always pray to be on the side ofGod. We're a nation that is dedicated to the proposition that all men and women are created equal. We live that truth within our military, and see it in the varied backgrounds of those we lay torest today. We defend that truth at home and abroad, and we know that Americans willalways be found on the side of liberty and equality. That's who we are as a people. Tomorrow is Veterans Day. It's a chance to pause, and to pay tribute -- for students to learnthe struggles that preceded them; for families to honor the service of parents andgrandparents; for citizens to reflect upon the sacrifices that have been made in pursuit of amore perfect union. For history is filled with heroes. You may remember the stories of a grandfather who marchedacross Europe; an uncle who fought in Vietnam; a sister who served in the Gulf. But as wehonor the many generations who have served, all of us -- every single American -- mustacknowledge that this generation has more than proved itself the equal of those who've comebefore. We need not look to the past for greatness, because it is before our very eyes. This generation of soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen have volunteeredin the time of certain danger. They are part of the finest fighting force that the world has everknown. They have served tour after tour of duty in distant, different, and difficult places. Theyhave stood watch in blinding deserts and on snowy mountains. They have extended the opportunity of self-government to peoples that have suffered tyrannyand war. They are men and women -- white, black, and brown -- of all faiths and all stations - - all Americans, serving together to protect our people, while giving others half a world awaythe chance to lead a better life. In today   s wars, there's not always a simple ceremony that signals our troops    success -- nosurrender papers to be signed, or capital to be claimed. But the measure of the impact ofthese young men and women is no less great. In a world of threats that no know borders,their legacy will be marked in the safety of our cities and towns, and the security andopportunity that's extended abroad. It will serve as testimony to the character of those whoserved, and the example that all of you in uniform set for America and for the world. Here at Fort Hood, we pay tribute to 13 men and women who were not able to escape thehorror of war, even in the comfort of home. Later today at Fort Lewis, one community willgather to remember so many in one Stryker Brigade who have fallen in Afghanistan. Long after they are laid to rest -- when the fighting has finished, and our nation has endured;when today   s servicemen and women are veterans and their children have grown -- it will besaid that this generation believed under the most trying of tests; believed in perseverance --not just when it was easy, but when it was hard; that they paid the price and bore the burdento secure this nation, and stood up for the values that live in the hearts of all free peoples. So we say goodbye to those who now belong to eternity. We press ahead in pursuit of the peace that guided their service. May God bless the memory of those that we have lost. And may God bless the United States of America.",obama
"To the United States Corps of Cadets, to the men and women of our armed services, and tomy fellow Americans: I want to speak to you tonight about our effort in Afghanistan -- thenature of our commitment there, the scope of our interests, and the strategy that myAdministration will pursue to bring this war to a successful conclusion. It's an extraordinaryhonor for me to do so here at West Point, where so many men and women have prepared tostand up for our security, and to represent what is finest about our country. To address these important issues, it's important to recall why America and our allies werecompelled to fight a war in Afghanistan in the first place. We did not ask for this fight. OnSeptember 11th, 2001, 19 men hijacked four airplanes and used them to murder nearly 3,000people. They struck at our military and economic nerve centers. They took the lives ofinnocent men, women, and children without regard to their faith or race or station. Were it notfor the heroic actions of passengers on board one of these flights, they could have also struckat one of the great symbols of our democracy in Washington, and killed many more. As we know, these men belonged to al Qaeda -- a group of extremists who have distorted anddefiled Islam, one of the world's great religions, to justify the slaughter of innocents. AlQaeda's base of operations was in Afghanistan, where they were harbored by the Taliban -- aruthless, repressive, and radical movement that seized control of that country after it wasravaged by years of Soviet occupation and civil war, and after the attention of America andour friends had turned elsewhere. Just days after 9/11, Congress authorized the use of force against al Qaeda and those whoharbored them -- an authorization that continues to this day. The vote in the Senate was 98to 0. The vote in the House was 420 to 1. For the first time in its history, the North AtlanticTreaty Organization invoked Article 5 -- the commitment that says an attack on one membernation is an attack on all. And the United Nations Security Council endorsed the use of allnecessary steps to respond to the 9/11 attacks. America, our allies, and the world were actingas one to destroy al Qaeda's terrorist network, and to protect our common security. Under the banner of this domestic unity and international legitimacy -- and only after theTaliban refused to turn over Osama bin Laden -- we sent our troops into Afghanistan. Within amatter of months, al Qaeda was scattered and many of its operatives were killed. The Talibanwas driven from power and pushed back on its heels. A place that had known decades of fearnow had reason to hope. At a conference convened by the UN, a provisional government wasestablished under President Hamid Karzai. And an International Security Assistance Force wasestablished to help bring a lasting peace to a war-torn country. Then, in early 2003, the decision was made to wage a second war in Iraq. The wrenchingdebate over the Iraq War is well-known and need not be repeated here. It's enough to saythat for the next six years, the Iraq War drew the dominant share of our troops, ourresources, our diplomacy, and our national attention -- and that the decision to go into Iraqcaused substantial rifts between America and much of the world. Today, after extraordinary costs, we are bringing the Iraq war to an responsible end. We willremove our combat brigades from Iraq by the end of next summer, and all of our troops bythe end of 2011. That we are doing so is a testament to the character of the men and womenin uniform. Thanks to their courage, grit, and perseverance, we have given Iraqis a chance toshape their future, and we are successfully leaving Iraq to its people. But while we have achieved hard-earned milestones in Iraq, the situation in Afghanistan hasdeteriorated. After escaping across the border into Pakistan in 2001 and 2002, al Qaeda'sleadership established a safe-haven there. Although a legitimate government was elected bythe Afghan people, it's been hampered by corruption, the drug trade, an under-developedeconomy, and insufficient security forces. Over the last several years, the Taliban hasmaintained common cause with al Qaeda, as they both seek an overthrow of the Afghangovernment. Gradually, the Taliban has begun to control additional swaths of territory inAfghanistan, while engaging in increasingly brazen and devastating attacks of terrorismagainst the Pakistani people. Now throughout this period, our troop levels in Afghanistan remained a fraction of what theywere in Iraq. When I took office, we had just over 32,000 Americans serving in Afghanistan,compared to 160,000 in Iraq at the peak of the war. Commanders in Afghanistan repeatedlyasked for support to deal with the reemergence of the Taliban, but these reinforcements didnot arrive. And that's why, shortly after taking office, I approved a long-standing request for moretroops. After consultations with our allies, I then announced a strategy recognizing thefundamental connection between our war effort in Afghanistan and the extremist safe-havensin Pakistan. I set a goal that was narrowly defined as disrupting, dismantling, and defeating alQaeda and its extremist allies, and pledged to better coordinate our military and civilian effort. Since then, we have made progress on some important objectives. High-ranking al Qaeda andTaliban leaders have been killed, and we've stepped up the pressure on al Qaeda world-wide.In Pakistan, that nation's Army has gone on its largest offensive in years. In Afghanistan, weand our allies prevented the Taliban from stopping a presidential election, and although it wasmarred by fraud, that election produced a government that is consistent with Afghanistan'slaws and Constitution. Yet huge challenges remain. Afghanistan is not lost, but for several years it has movedbackwards. There's no imminent threat of the government being overthrown, but the Talibanhas gained momentum. Al Qaeda has not reemerged in Afghanistan in the same numbers asbefore 9/11, but they retain their safe-havens along the border. And our forces lack the fullsupport they need to effectively train and partner with Afghan security forces and bettersecure the population. Our new Commander in Afghanistan, General McChrystal, has reportedthat the security situation is more serious than he anticipated. In short, the status quo is notsustainable. As cadets, you volunteered for service during this time of danger. Some of you fought inAfghanistan. Some of you will deploy there. As your Commander-in-Chief, I owe you a missionthat is clearly defined and worthy of your service. And that's why, after the Afghan voting wascompleted, I insisted on a thorough review of our strategy. Now let me be clear: There hasnever been an option before me that called for troop deployments before 2010. So there hasbeen no delay or denial of resources necessary for the conduct of the war during this reviewperiod. Instead, the review has allowed me ask the hard questions, and to explore all of thedifferent options along with my national security team, our military and civilian leadership inAfghanistan, and our key partners. Now given the stakes involved, I owed the Americanpeople, and our troops, no less. This review is now complete. And as Commander-in-Chief, I have determined that it is in ourvital national interest to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan. After 18months, our troops will begin to come home. These are the resources that we need to seizethe initiative, while building the Afghan capacity that can allow for a responsible transition ofour forces out of Afghanistan. I do not make this decision lightly. I opposed the war in Iraq precisely because I believe thatwe must exercise restraint in the use of military force, and always consider the long-termconsequences of our actions. We have been at war now for eight years, at enormous cost inlives and resources. Years of debate over Iraq and terrorism have left our unity on nationalsecurity issues in tatters and created a highly polarized and partisan backdrop for this effort. And having just experienced the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, theAmerican people are understandably focused on rebuilding our economy and putting people towork here at home. And most of all, I know that this decision asks even more of you -- a military that, along withyour families, has already borne the heaviest of all burdens. As President, I have signed aletter of condolence to the family of each American who gives their life in these wars. I haveread the letters from the parents and spouses of those who deployed. I've visited ourcourageous wounded warriors at Walter Reed. I've travelled to Dover to meet the flag-drapedcaskets of 18 Americans returning home to their final resting place. I see firsthand the terriblewages of war. If I did not think that the security of the United States and the safety of theAmerican people were at stake in Afghanistan, I would gladly order every single one of ourtroops home tomorrow. So no, I do not make this decision lightly. I make this decision because I am convinced thatour security is at stake in Afghanistan and Pakistan. This is the epicenter of violent extremismpracticed by al Qaeda. It is from here that we were attacked on 9/11, and it is from here thatnew attacks are being plotted as I speak. This is no idle danger, no hypothetical threat. In thelast few months alone, we have apprehended extremists within our borders who were senthere from the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan to commit new acts of terror. Andthis danger will only grow if the region slides backwards, and al Qaeda can operate withimpunity. We must keep the pressure on al Qaeda, and to do that we must increase thestability and capacity of our partners in the region. Of course this burden is not ours alone to bear. This is not just America's war. Since 9/11, alQaeda's safe-havens have been the source of attacks against London and Amman and Bali.The people and governments of both Afghanistan and Pakistan are endangered. And thestakes are even higher within a nuclear-armed Pakistan, because we know that al Qaeda andother extremists seek nuclear weapons, and we have every reason to believe that they woulduse them. These facts compel us to act along with our friends and allies. Our overarching goal remainsthe same: to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and toprevent its capacity to threaten America and our allies in the future. To meet that goal, we will pursue the following objectives within Afghanistan. We must denyal Qaeda a safe-haven. We must reverse the Taliban's momentum and deny it the ability tooverthrow the government. And we must strengthen the capacity of Afghanistan's securityforces and government, so that they can take lead responsibility for Afghanistan's future. We will meet these objectives in three ways. First, we will pursue a military strategy that willbreak the Taliban's momentum and increase Afghanistan's capacity over the next 18 months. The 30,000 additional troops that I'm announcing tonight will deploy in the first part of 2010 - - the fastest possible pace -- so that they can target the insurgency and secure key populationcenters. They'll increase our ability to train competent Afghan security forces, and to partnerwith them so that more Afghans can get into the fight. And they will help create the conditionsfor the United States to transfer responsibility to the Afghans. Because this is an international effort, I've asked that our commitment be joined bycontributions from our allies. Some have already provided additional troops, and we'reconfident that there will be further contributions in the days and weeks ahead. Our friendshave fought and bled and died alongside us in Afghanistan. And now we must come togetherto end this war successfully. For what's at stake is not simply a test of NATO's credibility;what's at stake is the security of our allies, and the common security of the world. Now taken together, these additional American and international troops will allow us toaccelerate handing over responsibility to Afghan forces, and allow us to begin the transfer ofour forces out of Afghanistan in July of 2011. Just as we have done in Iraq, we will executethis transition responsibly, taking into account conditions on the ground. We'll continue toadvise and assist Afghanistan's security forces to ensure that they can succeed over the longhaul. But it will be clear to the Afghan government -- and more importantly, to the Afghanpeople -- that they will ultimately be responsible for their own country. Second, we will work with our partners, the United Nations, and the Afghan people to pursuea more effective civilian strategy, so that the government can take advantage of improvedsecurity. This effort must be based on performance. The days of providing a blank check are over.President Karzai's inauguration speech sent the right message about moving in a newdirection. And going forward, we will be clear about what we expect from those who receiveour assistance. We'll support Afghan Ministries, governors, and local leaders that combatcorruption and deliver for the people. We expect those who are ineffective or corrupt to beheld accountable. And we will also focus our assistance in areas, such as agriculture, that canmake an immediate impact in the lives of the Afghan people. The people of Afghanistan have endured violence for decades. They've been confronted withoccupation by the Soviet Union, and then by foreign al Qaeda fighters who used Afghan landfor their own purposes. So tonight, I want the Afghan people to understand: America seeks anend to this era of war and suffering. We have no interest in occupying your country. We willsupport efforts by the Afghan government to open the door to those Taliban who abandonviolence and respect the human rights of their fellow citizens. And we will seek a partnership with Afghanistan grounded in mutual respect -- to isolate thosewho destroy, to strengthen those who build, to hasten the day when our troops will leave, andto forge a lasting friendship in which America is your partner, and never your patron. Third, we will act with the full recognition that our success in Afghanistan is inextricably linkedto our partnership with Pakistan. We're in Afghanistan to prevent a cancer from once again spreading through that country. Butthis same cancer has also taken root in the border region of Pakistan. And that's why we needa strategy that works on both sides of the border. In the past, there have been those in Pakistan who have argued that the struggle againstextremism is not their fight, and that Pakistan is better off doing little or seekingaccommodation with those who use violence. But in recent years, as innocents have beenkilled from Karachi to Islamabad, it has become clear that it is the Pakistani people who arethe most endangered by extremism. Public opinion has turned. The Pakistani Army has wagedan offensive in Swat and South Waziristan. And there is no doubt that the United States andPakistan share a common enemy. In the past, we too often defined our relationship with Pakistan narrowly. And those days areover. Moving forward, we are committed to a partnership with Pakistan that is built on afoundation of mutual interests, mutual respect, and mutual trust. We will strengthenPakistan's capacity to target those groups that threaten our countries, and have made it clearthat we cannot tolerate a safe-haven for terrorists whose location is known, and whoseintentions are clear. America is also providing substantial resources to support Pakistan'sdemocracy and development. We are the largest international supporter for those Pakistanisdisplaced by the fighting. And going forward, the Pakistani people must know: America willremain a strong supporter of Pakistan's security and prosperity long after the guns have fallensilent, so that the great potential of its people can be unleashed. These are the three core elements of our strategy: a military effort to create the conditions fora transition; a civilian surge that reinforces positive action; and an effective partnership withPakistan. I recognize that there are a range of concerns about our approach. So let me briefly address afew of the prominent arguments that I have heard, and which I take very seriously. First, there are those who suggest that Afghanistan is another Vietnam. They argue that itcannot be stabilized, and we're better off cutting our losses and rapidly withdrawing. I believethis argument depends upon a false reading of history. Unlike Vietnam, we are joined by abroad coalition of 43 nations that recognizes the legitimacy of our action. Unlike Vietnam, weare not facing a broad-based popular insurgency. And most importantly, unlike Vietnam, the American people were viciously attacked fromAfghanistan, and remain a target for those same extremists who are plotting along its border.To abandon this area now, and to rely only on efforts against al Qaeda from a distance, wouldsignificantly hamper our ability to keep the pressure on al Qaeda, and create an unacceptablerisk of additional attacks on our homeland and our allies. Second, there are those who acknowledge that we can't leave Afghanistan in its current state,but suggest that we go forward with the troops that we already have. But this would simplymaintain a status quo in which we muddle through, and permit a slow deterioration ofconditions there. It would ultimately prove more costly and prolong our stay in Afghanistan,because we would never be able to generate the conditions needed to train Afghan securityforces and give them the space to take over. Finally, there are those who oppose identifying a timeframe for our transition to Afghanresponsibility. Indeed, some call for a more dramatic and open-ended escalation of our wareffort -- one that would commit us to a nation building project of up to a decade. I reject thiscourse because it sets goals that are beyond what can be achieved at a reasonable cost, andwhat we need to achieve to secure our interests. Furthermore, the absence of a timeframe fortransition would deny us any sense of urgency in working with the Afghan government. Itmust be clear that Afghans will have to take responsibility for their security, and that Americahas no interest in fighting an endless war in Afghanistan. As President, I refuse to set goals that go beyond our responsibility, our means, or ourinterests. And I must weigh all of the challenges that our nation faces. I don't have the luxuryof committing to just one. Indeed, I'm mindful of the words of President Eisenhower, who -- indiscussing our national security -- said, ""Each proposal must be weighed in the light of abroader consideration: the need to maintain balance in and among national programs."" Over the past several years, we have lost that balance. We've failed to appreciate theconnection between our national security and our economy. In the wake of an economic crisis,too many of our neighbors and friends are out of work and struggle to pay the bills. Too manyAmericans are worried about the future facing our children. Meanwhile, competition within theglobal economy has grown more fierce. So we can't simply afford to ignore the price of thesewars. All told, by the time I took office the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan approached atrillion dollars. Going forward, I am committed to addressing these costs openly and honestly.Our new approach in Afghanistan is likely to cost us roughly 30 billion dollars for the militarythis year, and I'll work closely with Congress to address these costs as we work to bring downour deficit. But as we end the war in Iraq and transition to Afghan responsibility, we must rebuild ourstrength here at home. Our prosperity provides a foundation for our power. It pays for ourmilitary. It underwrites our diplomacy. It taps the potential of our people, and allowsinvestment in new industry. And it will allow us to compete in this century as successfully aswe did in the last. That's why our troop commitment in Afghanistan cannot be open-ended --because the nation that I am most interested in building is our own. Now let me be clear: None of this will be easy. The struggle against violent extremism will notbe finished quickly, and it extends well beyond Afghanistan and Pakistan. It will be anenduring test of our free society and our leadership in the world. And unlike the great powerconflicts and clear lines of division that defined the 20th century, our effort will involvedisorderly regions, failed states, diffuse enemies. So as a result, America will have to show our strength in the way that we end wars andprevent conflict -- not just how we wage wars. We'll have to be nimble and precise in our useof military power. Where al Qaeda and its allies attempt to establish a foothold -- whether inSomalia or Yemen or elsewhere -- they must be confronted by growing pressure and strongpartnerships. And we can't count on military might alone. We have to invest in our homeland security,because we can't capture or kill every violent extremist abroad. We have to improve andbetter coordinate our intelligence, so that we stay one step ahead of shadowy networks. We will have to take away the tools of mass destruction. And that's why I've made it a centralpillar of my foreign policy to secure loose nuclear materials from terrorists, to stop the spreadof nuclear weapons, and to pursue the goal of a world without them, because every nationmust understand that true security will never come from an endless race for ever-moredestructive weapons. True security will come for those who reject them. We will have to use diplomacy, because no one nation can meet the challenges of aninterconnected world acting alone. I've spent this year renewing our alliances and forging newpartnerships. And we have forged a new beginning between America and the Muslim World --one that recognizes our mutual interest in breaking a cycle of conflict, and that promises afuture in which those who kill innocents are isolated by those who stand up for peace andprosperity and human dignity. And finally, we must draw on the strength of our values. For the challenges that we face mayhave changed, but the things that we believe in must not. And that's why we must promoteour values by living them at home -- which is why I have prohibited torture and will close theprison at Guantanamo Bay. And we must make it clear to every man, woman, and childaround the world who lives under the dark cloud of tyranny that America will speak out onbehalf of their human rights, and tend to the light of freedom, and justice, and opportunity,and respect for the dignity of all peoples. That is who we are. That is the source, the moralsource of America's authority. Since the days of Franklin Roosevelt, and the service and sacrifice of our grandparents andgreat grandparents, our country has borne a special burden in global affairs. We have spilledAmerican blood in many countries on multiple continents. We have spent our revenue to helpothers rebuild from rubble and develop their own economies. We have joined with others todevelop an architecture of institutions from the United Nations to NATO to the World Bank thatprovide for the common security and prosperity of human beings. We have not always been thanked for these efforts, and we have at times made mistakes. Butmore than any other nation, the United States of America has underwritten global security forover six decades -- a time that, for all its problems, has seen walls come down, and marketsopen, and billions lifted from poverty, unparalleled scientific progress, and advancing frontiersof human liberty. For unlike the great powers of old, we have not sought world domination. Our union wasfounded in resistance to oppression. We do not seek to occupy other nations. We will notclaim another nation's resources or target other peoples because their faith or ethnicity isdifferent from ours. What we have fought for, and what we continue to fight for, is a betterfuture for our children and grandchildren, and we believe that their lives will be better ifothers [sic] peoples' children and grandchildren can live in freedom and access opportunity. As a country, we're not as young and perhaps not as innocent as we were when Rooseveltwas President. Yet we are still heirs to a noble struggle for freedom. And now we mustsummon all of our might and moral suasion to meet the challenges of a new age. In the end, our security and leadership does not come solely from the strength of our arms. Itderives from our people: from the workers and businesses who will rebuild our economy; fromthe entrepreneurs and researchers who will pioneer new industries; from the teachers that willeducate our children, and the service of those who work in our communities at home; fromthe diplomats and Peace Corps volunteers who spread hope abroad; and from the men andwomen in uniform who are part of an unbroken line of sacrifice that has made government ofthe people, by the people, and for the people a reality on this Earth.2 This vast and diverse citizenry will not always agree on every issue -- nor should we. But Ialso know that we, as a country, cannot sustain our leadership nor navigate the momentouschallenges of our time if we allow ourselves to be split asunder by the same rancor andcynicism and partisanship that has in recent times poisoned our national discourse. It's easy to forget that when this war began, we were united -- bound together by the freshmemory of a horrific attack, and by the determination to defend our homeland and the valueswe hold dear. I refuse to accept the notion that we cannot summon that unity again. I believe-- I believe with every fiber of my being that we, as Americans, can still come together behinda common purpose. For our values are not simply words written into parchment. They are acreed that calls us together, and that has carried us through the darkest of storms as onenation, as one people. America, we are passing through a time of great trial. And the message that we send in themidst of these storms must be clear: that our cause is just, our resolve unwavering. We willgo forward with the confidence that right makes might, and with the commitment to forge anAmerica that is safer, a world that is more secure, and a future that represents not thedeepest of fears but the highest of hopes. Thank you. God Bless you. And God Bless the United States of America.",obama
"As  many  of  you  know,  over  the  last  few  months  I've  been  thinking  hard  about  my  plans  for   2008.  Running  for  the  presidency  is  a  profound  decision        a  decision  no  one  should  make  on   the  basis  of  media  hype  or  personal  ambition  alone        and  so  before  I  committed  myself  and   my  family  to  this  race,  I  wanted  to  be  sure  that  this  was  right  for  us  and,  more  importantly,   right  for  the  country.   I  certainly  didn't  expect  to  find  myself  in  this  position  a  year  ago.  But  as  I've  spoken  to  many   of  you  in  my  travels  across  the  states  these  past  months,  as  I've  read  your  emails  and  read   your  letters,  I've  been  struck  by  how  hungry  we  all  are  for  a  different  kind  of  politics.  So  I've   spent  some  time  thinking  about  how  I  could  best  advance  the  cause  of  change  and  progress   that  we  so  desperately  need.   The  decisions  that  have  been  made  in  Washington  these  past  six  years,  and  the  problems  that   have  been  ignored,  have  put  our  country  in  a  precarious  place.  Our  economy  is  changing   rapidly,  and  that  means  profound  changes  for  working  people.  Many  of  you  have  shared  with   me  your  stories  about  skyrocketing  health  care  bills,  the  pensions  you've  lost  and  your   struggles  to  pay  for  college  for  your  kids.  Our  continued  dependence  on  oil  has  put  our   security  and  our  very  planet  at  risk.  And  we're  still  mired  in  a  tragic  and  costly  war  that  should   have  never  been  waged.   But  challenging  as  they  are,  it's  not  the  magnitude  of  our  problems  that  concerns  me  the   most.  It's  the  smallness  of  our  politics.  America's  faced  big  problems  before.  But  today,  our   leaders  in  Washington  seem  incapable  of  working  together  in  a  practical,  common  sense  way. Transcription  date  2010  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.  Copyright  Status:  Unknown   Page  1      Politics  has  become  so  bitter  and  partisan,  so  gummed  up  by  money  and  influence,  that  we   can't  tackle  the  big  problems  that  demand  solutions.  And  that's  what  we  have  to  change  first.   We  have  to  change  our  politics,  and  come  together  around  our  common  interests  and   concerns  as  Americans.   This  won't  happen  by  itself.  A  change  in  our  politics  can  only  come  from  you        from  people   across  our  country  who  believe  there's  a  better  way  and  are  willing  to  work  for  it.  Years  ago,   as  a  community  organizer  in  Chicago,  I  learned  that  meaningful  change  always  begins  at  the   grassroots,  and  that  engaged  citizens  working  together  can  accomplish  extraordinary  things.   So  even  in  the  midst  of  the  enormous  challenges  we  face  today,  I  have  great  faith  and  hope   about  the  future        because  I  believe  in  you.   And  that's  why  I  wanted  to  tell  you  first  that  I'll  be  filing  papers  today  to  create  a  presidential   exploratory  committee.  For  the  next  several  weeks,  I'm  going  to  talk  with  people  from  around   the  country,  listening  and  learning  more  about  the  challenges  we  face  as  a  nation,  the   opportunities  that  lie  before  us,  and  the  role  that  a  presidential  campaign  might  play  in   bringing  our  country  together.  And  on  February  10th,  at  the  end  of  these  discussions  and  in   my  home  state  of  Illinois,  I'll  share  my  plans  with  my  friends,  neighbors,  and  fellow   Americans.   In  the  meantime,  I  want  to  thank  all  of  you  for  your  time,  your  suggestions,  your   encouragement,  and  your  prayers.  And  I  look  forward  to  continuing  our  conversation  in  the   weeks  and  months  to  come. Transcription  date  2010  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.

"President Obama: Thank you. On behalf of Michelle and myself, welcome to the WhiteHouse. Little Child: Thank you. President Obama: Thank you. This a season of joy, tradition and celebration. Little Child: Yea! President Obama: Yes! And today, it is our great joy to continue a White House holidaytradition -- a celebration of performers who have transformed the arts in America, ourextraordinary Kennedy Center Honorees. We are joined by Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- members of Congress and members of the Kennedyfamily. I see sprinkled through the crowd some pretty fancy company, as well -- you've gotthe Queen of Soul. You've got Martin Scorsese -- he knows a little bit about film-making. Andmy spectacular First Lady is here, as well. I especially want to thank the man who created these Honors more than three decades agoand who has produced them ever since -- and whom I was proud to name as co-chair of thePresident's Committee on the Arts and Humanities -- George Stevens, Jr. George. And I want to also thank Stephen Schwarzman and the Kennedy Center trustees. As well aspresident Michael Kaiser and all those who sustain President Kennedy's vision of a ""greatstage"" celebrating ""the best coming from this country and abroad."" These performers are indeed the best. They are also living reminders of a simple truth -- andI'm going to steal a line from Michelle here -- the arts are not somehow apart from ournational life, the arts are at the heart of our national life. In times of war and sacrifice, the arts -- and these artists -- remind us to sing and to laughand to live. In times of plenty, they challenge our conscience and implore us to remember theleast among us. In moments of division or doubt, they compel us to see the common valuesthat we share; the ideals to which we aspire, even if we sometimes fall short. In days ofhardship, they renew our hope that brighter days are still ahead. So let's never forget that art strengthens America. And that's why we're making sure thatAmerica strengthens its arts. It's why we're reenergizing the National Endowment of theArts. That's why we're helping to sustain jobs in arts communities across the country. It'swhy we're supporting arts education in our schools, and why Michelle and I have hostedstudents here at the White House to experience the best of American poetry and music. And it's why we're honored to celebrate these five remarkable performers, who for decadeshave helped to sustain and strengthen the American spirit. You can't understand America without understanding jazz. And you can't understand jazz,without understanding Dave Brubeck. His mother was a classical pianist with high hopes forher son. And by the time he was four, he was playing himself. But by the time he was ateenager, he was tearing up local honky-tonks. Even his mother had to admit: ""There is somehope for David after all."" And perhaps it was World War II -- his service in Patton's Army -- that changed his sound,forcing him, as he said, to work the war out of his system by playing some ""pretty viciouspiano."" Whatever it was, his sound -- the distinctive harmonies and improvisations of theDave Brubeck Quartet -- would change jazz forever, prompting Time magazine to put him onthe cover as the leader of a new jazz age. Having brought jazz into the mainstream, he then transformed it, with innovative newrhythms on albums like Time Out -- the first jazz album to ever sell more than a millioncopies and still one of the best-selling jazz albums of all time. Dave Brubeck has never stopped reaching new audiences: Performing for Presidents fromJohnson to Reagan; composing orchestral tributes to Martin Luther King and Pope John PaulII; and even in his 80s, dazzling jazz festivals across America. And I know personally how powerful his performances can be. I mentioned this to Davebackstage. In the few weeks that I spent with my father as a child -- he came to visit me forabout a month when I was young -- one of the things he did was to take me to my first jazzconcert, in Honolulu, Hawaii, in 1971, and it was a Dave Brubeck concert. And I've been ajazz fan ever since. The world that he opened up for a 10-year-old boy was spectacular. And, Dave, for the joy that you've given millions of jazz lovers like me, for your six decades ofrevolutionary rhythms, you are rightly honored -- especially today, on your 89th birthday. He was born Melvin Kaminsky -- Mel Brooks: He never understood 4/4 time1 -- President Obama: He's still messing it up, Mel. Mel, I'm trying to say something nice aboutyou, now. Please don't upstage me. As you can tell, he was born to entertain. Or, as Mel Brooks explains it: ""Look at Jewishhistory -- unrelieved lamenting would be intolerable. So every 10 Jews, God designed one tobe crazy and amuse the others."" According to Mel, ""By the time I was five I knew I was thatone."" And by the time he was nine, this boy from Brooklyn had seen his first musical and dreamedof becoming ""the King of Broadway."" But World War II meant service in the Army -- or, as heput it, ""the European Theater of Operations"" with ""lots of operations"" and ""very little theater."" Returning home, he found success cranking out quips for Sid Ceasar -- or as Mel described hisreaction to success -- ""panic, hysteria, insomnia   and years of psychoanalysis."" That's right, we're reading back all your golden moments here, Mel. Unfortunately, many of the punch lines that have defined Mel Brooks' success cannot berepeated here. I was telling him that I went to see Blazing Saddles -- when I was 10. And hepointed out that I think, according to the ratings, I should not have been allowed in thetheater. That's true. I think I had a fake ID. But the statute of limitations has passed. Suffice it to say, in his satires and parodies, no cow is sacred, no genre is safe. He mockedthe musical -- and Hitler -- in The Producers, the western in Blazing Saddles, and the horrorfilm in Young Frankenstein. But behind all the insanity and absurdity, there's been a method to Mel's madness. He'sdescribed his work as ""unearthing the truth that is all around us."" And by illuminatinguncomfortable truths -- about racism and sexism and anti-Semitism -- he's been called ""ourjester, asking us to see ourselves as we really are, determined that we laugh ourselves sane."" For this, he is one of the few people ever to receive an Emmy and a Grammy and an Oscarand a Tony. Writer, director, actor, producer, composer   for his success -- and for hispsychoanalysis -- we honor Mel Brooks. Reflecting on the challenge of finding one's voice, Grace Bumbry once said: ""God has alreadyplanted that in your throat. It's your job to free it up, to allow that beautiful thing to shinethrough."" True to her name, Grace allowed her voice to shine through and touch all those within itsrange. Around her family's piano in St. Louis; on the talent show where, as a teenager, shemoved the host to tears; and then, after being turned away from one music school because ofthe color of her skin -- her triumphant international debut at the Paris Opera, when she wasjust 23 years old. With a pitch and presence like no other, she became a global sensation, moving audiences atthe great opera houses of the world. And performing here at the White House, it was saidthat she moved Jacqueline Kennedy to lean over and gently sing along the words to thePresident. Defying every expectation, Grace Bumbry then made the transition from mezzo to soprano. And over the decades that followed, she displayed a range like few others -- sometimes themiddle ranges as a mezzo; sometimes the highs of a soprano; sometimes both in the sameperformance. Grace not only triumphed in different techniques, she transformed them. And though she gave her final operatic performance in 1997, she appears in recitals to thisday. After nearly 50 years, she remains the definition of a diva in the classical sense: adivine voice worthy of the heavens. And tonight -- 32 years after she performed at the firstKennedy Center Honors for her mentor Marian Anderson -- we honor Grace Bumbry. Growing up in New York City's Little Italy, Bobby De Niro always knew what he wanted to be. Coming home from the movies, he'd act out the parts. At age 10, in his school play, he madea rather unlikely debut in The Wizard of Oz as the Cowardly Lion. He has said: ""my joy as an actor is to live different lives."" And in more than 60 filmsspanning more than 40 years, Robert De Niro has lived some of the most iconic and intensecharacters ever portrayed on film. A dying baseball player in Bang The Drum Slowly. Ayoung Vito Corleone in The Godfather Part II. A deranged Taxi Driver. A troubled veteran inThe Deer Hunter. A brutal boxer in Raging Bull. A vengeful ex-con in Cape Fear. Let's hopethat Martin Scorsese was kidding when he said that Robert is ""full of something that hewanted to express."" Don't worry, we did a vet on him before he came in tonight. But alongside his Oscar-winning emotional audacity there's his versatility, from a coma patientin Awakenings, to an ever-possessive father in Meet The Parents. There's his legendarymethod -- not simply portraying characters, but becoming them, emotionally and physically. And there is his love for his city -- whether it's directing films like A Bronx Tale, or foundingthe film center and festival that has energized the arts in New York City. It is perhaps the great irony of his life -- one of America's greatest cinematic actors is a man,famously, of few words off the screen -- and I can attest to this. So I'll simply say, thank you,Robert De Niro. Finally, we honor the quiet kid from Jersey -- who grew up to become the rock 'n' roll laureateof a generation. For in the life of our country only a handful of people have tapped the fullpower of music to tell the real American story -- with honesty; from the heart; and one ofthose people is Bruce Springsteen. He has said: ""I've always believed that people listen to your music not to find out about you,but to find out about themselves."" And for more than three decades, in his songs -- ofdreams and despair, of struggle and hope -- hardworking folks have seen themselves. They've seen their great state of New Jersey. And they've seen their America -- in songs thatbecome anthems. Restless kids who were ""Born to Run."" The struggles of workers in ""MyHometown."" The sacrifices of vets who were ""Born in the U.S.A."" Love and loss in ""Streets ofPhiladelphia."" A resilient nation in ""The Rising."" And, this year, a country ""Working on aDream."" It's no wonder that his tours are not so much concerts, but communions. There's a place foreverybody -- the sense that no matter who you are or what you do, everyone deserves theirshot at the American Dream; everybody deserves a little bit of dignity; everybody deserves tobe heard. I've seen it myself. Bruce was a great fan -- a great friend over the last year, and when Iwatched him on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial when he rocked the National Mall before myinauguration, I thought it captured as well as anything the spirit of what America should beabout. On a day like that, and today, I remember: I'm the President, but he's The Boss. And Bruce continues to inspire, along with his ""house-rocking, earth-shaking"" E Street Band. At 60 years old, he's still filling stadiums, still whipping fans into a frenzy, still surfing thecrowd, still jumping off pianos, and still reaching new fans, and still being nominated forGrammys. It's been a long road from that stage at Stone Pony in Asbury Park to this stagetoday, but this much we know -- after more than 30 years and 120 million albums sold, BruceSpringsteen is still one ""cool rockin' Daddy."" Dave Brubeck. Mel Brooks. Grace Bumbry. Robert De Niro. Bruce Springsteen. Theirstories are their own. But the part that they play in the larger American story -- that's whatwe honor here tonight. What they say is that with respect for the past, we can keep strongthe traditions and values that enrich us all; that with confidence in the present, and inourselves, we can overcome whatever comes our way; and that with faith in the future,America's greatest ""Glory Days"" are still to come. So thank you to all of our honorees. Thank you all very much for the joy and the beauty thatyou've contributed to our lives. We are very grateful. Thank you.",obama
"Thank you so much, Strobe, for your extraordinary leadership here at Brookings, and thanksto all of you in attendance. Almost exactly one year ago, on a frigid winter's day, I met with my new economic team atthe headquarters of my presidential transition offices in Chicago. And over the course of fourhours, my advisors presented an analysis of where the economy at that time stood,accompanied by a chilling set of charts and graphs, predicting where we might end up. It wasan unforgettable series of presentations. Christy Romer -- who's here today -- tapped to head the Council of Economic Advisers, as wellas Larry Summers, who I'd chosen to head the National Economic Council, described animminent downturn comparable in its severity to almost nothing since the 1930s. TimGeithner, my incoming Treasury Secretary, reported that the financial system, shaken by thesubprime crisis, had halted almost all lending, which in turn threatened to pull the broadereconomy in a downward spiral. Peter Orszag, my incoming Budget Director, closed out theproceedings with an entirely dismal report on the fiscal health of the country, with growingdeficits and debt stretching to the horizon. Having concluded that it was too late for me torequest a recount -- I tasked my team with mapping out a plan to tackle the crisis on allfronts. It wasn't long after that meeting, as we shaped this economic plan, that we began to seesome of these forecasts materialize. Over the previous year, it was obvious that folks werefacing hard times. As I traveled across the country during the long campaign, I would meetmen and women bearing the brunt of not only a deepening recession, but also years -- evendecades -- of growing strains on middle class families. But now the country was experiencingsomething far worse. Our gross domestic product -- the sum total of all that our economyproduces -- fell at the fastest rate in a quarter century. Five trillion dollars of Americans'household wealth evaporated in just 12 weeks as stocks, pensions, and home valuesplummeted. We were losing an average of 700,000 jobs each month, equivalent to thepopulation of the state of Vermont. That was true in December, January, February, March. The fear among economists across the political spectrum that was -- was that we were rapidlyplummeting towards a second Great Depression. So, in the weeks and months that followed, we undertook a series of difficult steps to preventthat outcome. And we were forced to take those steps largely without the help of anopposition party, which, unfortunately, after having presided over the decision-making thathad led to the crisis, decided to hand it over to others to solve. We acted to get lending flowing again so businesses could get loans to buy equipment, andordinary Americans could get financing to buy homes and cars, to go to college, and to startor run businesses. We enacted measures to stem the tide of foreclosures in our housingmarket, helping responsible homeowners stay in their homes and helping to stop the broaderdecline in home values which was eating away at what tends to be a family's largest asset. To achieve this, and to prevent economic collapse, we were forced to extend assistance tosome of the very banks and financial institutions whose actions had helped precipitate theturmoil. We also took steps to prevent the rapid dissolution of the American auto industry --which faced a crisis partly of its own making -- to prevent the loss of hundreds of thousandsof jobs during an already fragile, shaky time. These were not decisions that were popular orsatisfying; these were decisions that were necessary. Now, even as we worked to address the crises in our banking sector, in our housing market,and in our auto industry, we also began attacking our economic crisis on a broader front. Lessthan one month after taking office we enacted the most sweeping economic recovery packagein history: the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The Recovery Act was divided into three parts. One-third went for tax relief for smallbusinesses and 95 percent of working families. Another third was for emergency relief to helpfolks who've borne the brunt of this recession. We extended or increased unemploymentbenefits for more than 17 million Americans; made health insurance 65 percent cheaper forfamilies relying on COBRA. And for state and local governments facing historic budgetshortfalls as demand for services went up and revenues went down, we provided assistancethat has saved the jobs of hundreds of thousands of teachers and public school workers,firefighters and police officers. The last third of the Recovery Act is for investments to put Americans to work doing the workthat America needs done: doubling our capacity in renewable energy like wind and solar;computerizing medical records to save money and lives; providing the largest boost tomedical research in history; renovating classrooms and school laboratories; and upgradingroads and railways as part of the largest investment in infrastructure since the creation of theInterstate Highway System half a century ago. And even as the Recovery Act has created jobs and spurred growth, we have not let up in ourefforts to take every responsible action to get the economy growing and America working. This fall, I signed into law more than $30 billion in tax cuts for struggling businesses,extended an effective tax credit for homebuyers, and provided additional unemploymentinsurance for one million Americans. And the Treasury is continuing to adapt our financialstability plan, helping to facilitate the flow of small credit to small businesses and families. Inaddition, we're working to break down barriers and open overseas markets so our companiescan better compete globally, creating jobs in America by exporting our products around theworld. Now, partly as a result of these and other steps, we are in a very different place today thanwe were one year ago. We may forget, but we're in a very different place. We can safely saythat we are no longer facing the potential collapse of our financial system and we've avoidedthe depression many feared. Our economy is growing for the first time in a year, and theswing from contraction to expansion since the beginning of the year is the largest in nearlythree decades. Finally, we're no longer seeing the severe deterioration in the job market that we once were. In fact we learned on Friday that the unemployment rate fell slightly last month. This iswelcome news, and news made possible in part by the up to 1.6 million jobs that theRecovery Act has already created and saved according to the Congressional Budget Office. But I'm here today because our work is far from done. For even though we've reduced thedeluge of job losses to a relative trickle, we are not yet creating jobs at a pace to help allthose families who've been swept up in the flood. There are more than 7 million fewerAmericans with jobs today than when this recession began. That's a staggering figure, andone that reflects not only the depths of the hole from which we must ascend, but also acontinuing human tragedy. It was mentioned that I was in Allentown, Pennsylvania, this past weekend, and went to a jobcenter where people were engaged in job search. And it ran the spectrum -- blacks, whites,Hispanics, young people who were just starting their careers, individuals 50, 60 years old,looking for a job. And they were putting a brave face on it, confident that eventually thingswould work out, but you could also see the sense of anxiety, the fear that perhaps this time itwas different. Sometimes it's hard to break out of the bubble here in Washington and remind ourselves thatbehind these statistics are people's lives, their capacity to do right by their families. It speaksto an urgent need to accelerate job growth in the short term while laying a new foundation forlasting economic growth. My economic team has been considering a full range of additional ideas to help accelerate thepace of private sector hiring. We held a jobs forum at the White House that brought togethersmall business owners, CEOs, union members, economists, folks from non-profits, and stateand local officials to talk about job creation. And I've asked people to lead forums in theirown communities -- sending the results to me -- so we are hearing as many voices as possibleas we refine our proposals. We've already heard a number of good ideas, and I know we'lllearn of many more. So today, I want to outline some of the broader steps that I believe should be at the heart ofour effort to accelerate job growth -- those areas that will generate the greatest number ofjobs while generating the greatest value for our economy. First, we're proposing a series of steps to help small businesses grow and hire new staff. Overthe past 15 years, small businesses have created roughly 65 percent of all new jobs inAmerica. These are companies formed around kitchen tables in family meetings, formedwhen an entrepreneur takes a chance on a dream, formed when a worker decides it's time shebecame her own boss. These are also companies that drive innovation, producing 13 timesmore patents per employee than large companies. And it's worth remembering, every once ina while a small business becomes a big business -- and changes the world. That's why it's so important that we help small business struggling to stay open, or strugglingto open in the first place, during these difficult times. Building on the tax cuts in the RecoveryAct, we're proposing a complete elimination of capital gains taxes on small businessinvestment along with an extension of write-offs to encourage small businesses to expand inthe coming year. And I believe it's worthwhile to create a tax incentive to encourage smallbusinesses to add and keep employees, and I'm going to work with Congress to pass one. Now, these steps will help, but we also have to address the continuing struggle of smallbusinesses to get loans that they need to start up and grow. To that end, we're proposing towaive fees and increase the guarantees for SBA-backed loans. And I'm asking my TreasurySecretary to continue mobilizing the remaining TARP funds to facilitate lending to smallbusinesses. Second, we're proposing a boost in investment in the nation's infrastructure beyond what wasincluded in the Recovery Act, to continue modernizing our transportation and communicationsnetworks. These are needed public works that engage private sector companies, spurringhiring all across the country. Already, more than 10,000 of these projects have been funded through the Recovery Act. And by design, Recovery Act work on roads, bridges, water systems, Superfund sites,broadband networks, and clean energy projects will all be ramping up in the months ahead. Itwas planned this way for two reasons: so the impact would be felt over a two-year period;and, more importantly, because we wanted to do this right. The potential for abuse in a program of this magnitude, while operating at such a fast pace,was enormous. So I asked Vice President Biden and others to make sure to the extenthumanly possible that the investments were sound, the projects worthy, and the executionefficient. What this means is that we're going to see even more work -- and workers -- onrecovery projects in the next six months than we saw in the last six months. Even so, there are many more worthy projects than there were dollars to fund them. Irecognize that by their nature these projects often take time, and will therefore create jobsover time. But the need for jobs will also last beyond next year and the benefits of theseinvestments will last years beyond that. So adding to this initiative to rebuild America'sinfrastructure is the right thing to do. Third, I'm calling on Congress to consider a new program to provide incentives for consumerswho retrofit their homes to become more energy-efficient, which we know creates jobs, savesmoney for families, and reduces the pollution that threatens our environment. And I'mproposing that we expand select Recovery Act initiatives to promote energy efficiency andclean energy jobs which have been proven to be particularly popular and effective. It's a positive sign that many of these programs drew so many applicants for funding that alot of strong proposals -- proposals that will leverage private capital and create jobs quickly --did not make the cut. With additional resources, in areas like advanced manufacturing ofwind turbines and solar panels, for instance, we can help turn good ideas into good privatesector jobs. Finally, as we are moving forward in these areas, we should also extend the relief in theRecovery Act, including emergency assistance to seniors, unemployment insurance benefits,COBRA, and relief to states and localities to prevent layoffs. This will help folks weatheringthese storms, while boosting consumer spending and promoting job growth. Of course, there's only so much government can do. Job creation will ultimately depend on thereal job creators: businesses across America. We were encouraged today to hear from theBusiness Roundtable that their survey showed greater confidence and greater potentialinvestment coming out of the business community. Government can help lay the groundwork on which the private sector can better generatejobs, growth, and innovation. After all, small business tax relief is not a substitute foringenuity and industriousness by our entrepreneurs -- but it can help those with good ideas togrow and expand. Incentives to promote energy efficiency and clean energy manufacturing don't automaticallycreate jobs or lower carbon emissions -- but these steps provide a framework in whichcompanies can compete and innovate to create those jobs and reduce energy consumption. And while modernizing the physical and virtual networks that connect us will create private- sector jobs, they'll do so while making it possible for companies to more easily and effectivelymove their products across this country and around the world, and that will create more jobs. And given the challenges of accelerating the pace of hiring in the private sector, thesetargeted initiatives are right and they are needed. But with a fiscal crisis to match oureconomic crisis, we also must be prudent about how we fund it. So to help support theseefforts, we are going to wind down the Troubled Asset Relief Program -- or TARP -- the fundcreated to stabilize the financial system so banks would lend again. I don't think I have to tell you there has rarely been a less loved or more necessaryemergency program than TARP, which -- as galling as the assistance to banks may have been-- indisputably helped prevent a collapse of the entire financial system. Launched hastily --understandably, but hastily -- under the last administration, the TARP program was flawed,and we have worked hard to correct those flaws and manage it properly. And today, TARPhas served its original purpose and at much lower cost than we expected. In fact, because of our stewardship of this program, and the transparency and accountabilitywe put in place, TARP is expected to cost the taxpayers at least $200 billion less than whatwas anticipated just this past summer. And the assistance to banks, once thought to costtaxpayers untold billions, is on track to actually reap billions in profits for the taxpayingpublic. So this gives us a chance to pay down the deficit faster than we thought possible andto shift funds that would have gone to help the banks on Wall Street to help create jobs onMain Street. Small business, infrastructure, clean energy -- these are areas in which we can put Americansto work while putting our nation on a sturdier economic footing. That foundation for sustainedeconomic growth -- that must be our continuing focus and our ultimate goal. I've said this before. Even before this particular crisis, much of our growth for a decade ormore had been fueled by unsustainable consumer debt and reckless financial speculation,while we ignored the fundamental challenges that hold the key to our economic prosperity. We cannot simply go back to the way things used to be. We can't go back to an economy thatyielded cycle after cycle of speculative booms and painful busts. We can't continue to acceptan education system in which our students trail their peers in other countries, and a healthcare system in which exploding costs put our businesses at a competitive disadvantage. Andwe cannot continue to ignore the clean energy challenge or cede global leadership in theemerging industries of the 21st century. And that's why, even as we strive to meet the crisisof the moment, we have insisted on laying a new foundation for the future. Because an educated workforce is essential to a 21st century global economy, we've launcheda competitive Race to the Top fund through the Recovery Act to reform our schools and raiseachievement, especially in math and science. And we've made college more affordable,proposed a historic set of reforms and investments in community college, and set a goal ofonce again leading the world in producing college graduates by the year 2020. Because even the best-trained worker in the world can't compete if our businesses aresaddled with rapidly increasing health care costs, we are fighting to do what we havediscussed in this country for generations -- finally reforming our nation's broken healthinsurance system and relieving this unsustainable burden. Because our economic future depends on a financial system that encourages soundinvestments, honest dealings, and long-term growth, we've proposed the most ambitiousfinancial reforms since the Great Depression. We'll set and enforce clear rules of the road,close loopholes in oversight, charge a new agency with protecting consumers and address thedangerous, systemic risks that brought us to the brink of disaster. These reforms are movingthrough Congress, we're working to keep those reforms strong, and I'm looking forward tosigning them into law. And because our economic future depends on our leadership in the industries of the future, weare investing in basic applied research, and working to create the incentives to build a newclean energy economy. For we know the nation that leads in clean energy will be the nationthat leads the world. I want America to be that nation. I want America's prosperity to bepowered by what we invent and pioneer -- not just what we borrow and what we consume. And I know that we can and will be that nation if we are willing to do what it takes to getthere. Now, there are those who claim we have to choose between paying down our deficits on theone hand, and investing in job creation and economic growth on the other. This is a falsechoice. Ensuring that economic growth and job creation are strong and sustained is critical toensuring that we are increasing revenues and decreasing spending on things likeunemployment insurance so that our deficits will start coming down. At the same time,instilling confidence in our commitment to being fiscally prudent gives the private sector theconfidence to make long-term investments in our people and in America. So one of the central goals of this administration is restoring fiscal responsibility. Even as wehave had to spend our way out of this recession in the near term, we've begun to make thehard choices necessary to get our country on a more stable fiscal footing in the long run. Solet me just be clear here. Despite what some have claimed, the cost of the Recovery Act isonly a very small part of our current budget imbalance. In reality, the deficit had beenbuilding dramatically over the previous eight years. We have a structural gap between themoney going out and the money coming in. Folks passed tax cuts and expansive entitlement programs without paying for any of it -- evenas health care costs kept rising, year after year. As a result, the deficit had reached $1.3trillion when we walked into the White House. And I'd note: These budget-busting tax cutsand spending programs were approved by many of the same people who are now waxingpolitical about fiscal responsibility, while opposing our efforts to reduce deficits by gettinghealth care costs under control. It's a sight to see. The fact is we have refused to go along with business as usual; we are taking responsibilityfor every dollar we spend. We've done what some said was impossible: preventing wastefulspending on outdated weapons systems that even the Pentagon said it didn't want. We'vecombed the budget, cutting waste and excess wherever we could. I'm still committed tohalving the deficit we inherited by the end of my first term -- cutting it in half. And I made clear from day one that I would not sign a health insurance reform bill if it raisedthe deficit by one dime -- and neither the House, nor the Senate bill does. We've begun notonly changing policies in Washington, we've also begun to change the culture in Washington. In the end, the economic crisis of the past year was not just the result of weaknesses in oureconomy. It was also the result of weaknesses in our political system, because for decades,too many in Washington put off the hard decisions. For decades, we've watched as efforts tosolve tough problems have fallen prey to the bitterness of partisanship, to prosaic concerns ofpolitics, to ever-quickening news cycles, to endless campaigns focused on scoring pointsinstead of meeting our common challenges. We've seen the consequences of this failure of responsibility. The American people have paida heavy price. And the question we'll have to answer now is if we're going to learn from ourpast, or if -- even in the aftermath of disaster -- we're going to repeat those same mistakes. As the alarm bells fade, the din of Washington rises, as the forces of the status quo marshaltheir resources, we can be sure that answering this question will be a fight to the finish. But Ihave every hope and expectation that we can rise to this moment, that we can transcend thefailures of the past, that we can once again take responsibility for our future. Every night I read letters and e-mails sent to me from people across America -- ordinaryfolks, people who share their hopes and their hardships, their faith in this country, theirfrustration with what's happened in this economy. I hear from small business owners worriedabout making payroll, keeping their doors open. I hear from mothers and fathers, sons anddaughters, who've seen one or two or more family members out of work. The toughest lettersare in children's handwriting -- kids write to me, my dad just lost a job; my grandma is sick,she can't afford health insurance -- kids who can't just be kids because they're worried aboutmom having her hours cut or dad losing a job, or a family without health insurance. These folks aren't looking for a handout, they're not looking for a bailout -- just like thosepeople I visited in Allentown -- all they're looking for is a chance to make their own way, towork, to succeed using their talents and skills. And they're looking for folks in Washington tohave a seriousness of purpose that matches the reality of their struggle. Everywhere I've gone, every stop I've made, there are people like this, men and women whohave faced misfortune, but who stand ready to build a better future: students ready to learn,workers eager to work, scientists on the brink of discovery, entrepreneurs seeking the chanceto open a small business. Everywhere I go, there are once-shuttered factories just waiting towhir back to life in burgeoning industries. There is a nation ready to meet the challenges ofthis new age and to lead the world in this new century. And as we look back on the progressof the past year, and look forward to the work ahead, I have every confidence that we will doexactly that. These have been a tough two years. And there will no doubt be difficult months ahead. Butthe storms of the past are receding. The skies are brightening. And the horizon is beckoningonce more. Thank you very much.",obama
"Your  Majesties,  Your  Royal  Highnesses,  distinguished  members  of  the  Norwegian  Nobel   Committee,  citizens  of  America,  and  citizens  of  the  world:   I  receive  this  honor  with  deep  gratitude  and  great  humility.  It's  an  award  that  speaks  to  our   highest  aspirations        that  for  all  the  cruelty  and  hardship  of  our  world,  we  are  not  mere   prisoners  of  fate.  Our  actions  matter,  and  can  bend  history  in  the  direction  of  justice.   And  yet,  I  would  be  remiss  if  I  did  not  acknowledge  the  considerable  controversy  that  your   generous  decision  has  generated.  In  part,  this  is  because  I  am  at  the  beginning,  and  not  the   end,  of  my  labors  on  the  world  stage.  Compared  to  some  of  the  giants  of  history  who've   received  this  prize        Schweitzer  and  King,  Marshall  and  Mandela        my  accomplishments  are   slight.  And  then  there  are  the  men  and  women  around  the  world  who've  been  jailed  and   beaten  in  the  pursuit  of  justice    those  who  toil  in  humanitarian  organizations  to  relieve   suffering    the  unrecognized  millions  whose  quiet  acts  of  courage  and  compassion  inspire  even   the  most  hardened  cynics.  I  cannot  argue  with  those  who  find  these  men  and  women        some   known,  some  obscure  to  all  but  those  they  help        to  be  far  more  deserving  of  this  honor  than   I.   But  perhaps  the  most  profound  issue  surrounding  my  receipt  of  this  prize  is  the  fact  that  I  am   the  Commander  in  Chief  of  the  military  of  a  nation  in  the  midst  of  two  wars.  One  of  these   wars  is  winding  down.  The  other  is  a  conflict  that  America  did  not  seek,  one  in  which  we  are   joined  by  42  other  countries        including  Norway        in  an  effort  to  defend  ourselves  and  all   nations  from  further  attacks.   Still,  we  are  at  war.  And  I  am  responsible  for  the  deployment  of  thousands  of  young   Americans  to  battle  in  a  distant  land.  Some  will  kill    and  some  will  be  killed.  And  so  I  come   here  with  an  acute  sense  of  the  costs  of  armed  conflict        filled  with  difficult  questions  about   the  relationship  between  war  and  peace,  and  our  effort  to  replace  one  with  the  other. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Copyright  Status:  Restricted,  seek  permission.    2010   Page  1      Now  these  questions  are  not  new.  War,  in  one  form  or  another,  appeared  with  the  first   man.  At  the  dawn  of  history,  its  morality  was  not  questioned    it  was  simply  a  fact,  like   drought  or  disease        the  manner  in  which  tribes  and  then  civilizations  sought  power  and   settled  their  differences.   And  over  time,  as  codes  of  law  sought  to  control  violence  within  groups,  so  did  philosophers   and  clerics  and  statesmen  seek  to  regulate  the  destructive  power  of  war.  The  concept  of  a   ""just  war""  emerged,  suggesting  that  war  is  justified  only  when  certain  conditions  were  met:  if   it  is  waged  as  a  last  resort  or  in  self  defense    if  the  force  used  is  proportional    and  if,   whenever  possible,  civilians  are  spared  from  violence.   Of  course,  we  know  that  for  most  of  history,  this  concept  of  ""just  war""  was  rarely   observed.  The  capacity  of  human  beings  to  think  up  new  ways  to  kill  one  another  proved   inexhaustible,  as  did  our  capacity  to  exempt  from  mercy  those  who  look  different  or  pray  to  a   different  God.  Wars  between  armies  gave  way  to  wars  between  nations        total  wars  in  which   the  distinction  between  combatant  and  civilian  became  blurred.  In  the  span  of  30  years,  such   carnage  would  twice  engulf  this  continent.  And  while  it's  hard  to  conceive  of  a  cause  more  just   than  the  defeat  of  the  Third  Reich  and  the  Axis  powers,  World  War  II  was  a  conflict  in  which   the  total  number  of  civilians  who  died  exceeded  the  number  of  soldiers  who  perished.   In  the  wake  of  such  destruction,  and  with  the  advent  of  the  nuclear  age,  it  became  clear  to   victor  and  vanquished  alike  that  the  world  needed  institutions  to  prevent  another  world   war.  And  so  a  quarter  century  after  the  United  States  Senate  rejected  the  League  of  Nations           an  idea  for  which  Woodrow  Wilson  received  this  prize        America  led  the  world  in   constructing  an  architecture  to  keep  the  peace:  a  Marshall  Plan,  and  a  United  Nations     mechanisms  to  govern  the  waging  of  war,  treaties  to  protect  human  rights,  prevent  genocide,   restrict  the  most  dangerous  weapons.   In  many  ways,  these  efforts  succeeded.  Yes,  terrible  wars  have  been  fought,  and  atrocities   committed.  But  there  has  been  no  Third  World  War.  The  Cold  War  ended  with  jubilant  crowds   dismantling  a  wall.  Commerce  has  stitched  much  of  the  world  together.  Billions  have  been   lifted  from  poverty.  The  ideals  of  liberty  and  self  determination,  equality,  and  the  rule  of  law   have  haltingly  advanced.  We  are  the  heirs  of  the  fortitude  and  foresight  of  generations  past,   and  it  is  a  legacy  for  which  my  own  country  is  rightfully  proud.   And  yet,  a  decade  into  a  new  century,  this  old  architecture  is  buckling  under  the  weight  of   new  threats.  The  world  may  no  longer  shudder  at  the  prospect  of  war  between  two  nuclear   superpowers,  but  proliferation  may  increase  the  risk  of  catastrophe.  Terrorism  has  long  been  a   tactic,  but  modern  technology  allows  a  few  small  men  with  outsized  rage  to  murder  innocents   on  a  horrific  scale.   Moreover,  wars  between  nations  have  increasingly  given  way  to  wars  within  nations.  The   resurgence  of  ethnic  or  sectarian  conflicts    the  growth  of  secessionist  movements,   insurgencies,  and  failed  states        all  these  things  have  increasingly  trapped  civilians  in   unending  chaos.  In  today's  wars,  many  more  civilians  are  killed  than  soldiers    the  seeds  of   future  conflict  are  sown,  economies  are  wrecked,  civil  societies  torn  asunder,  refugees   amassed,  children  scarred.

Copyright  Status:  Restricted,  seek  permission.    2010   Page  2      I  do  not  bring  with  me  today  a  definitive  solution  to  the  problems  of  war.  What  I  do  know  is   that  meeting  these  challenges  will  require  the  same  vision,  hard  work,  and  persistence  of   those  men  and  women  who  acted  so  boldly  decades  ago.  And  it  will  require  us  to  think  in  new   ways  about  the  notions  of  ""just  war""  and  the  imperatives  of  a  just  peace.   We  must  begin  by  acknowledging  a  hard  truth:  We  will  not  eradicate  violent  conflict  in  our   lifetimes.  There  will  be  times  when  nations,  acting  individually  or  in  concert,  will  find  the  use   of  force  not  only  necessary  but  morally  justified.   I  make  this  statement  mindful  of  what  Martin  Luther  King  Jr.  said  in  this  same  ceremony   years  ago:  ""Violence  never  brings  permanent  peace.  It  solves  no  social  problem.  It  merely   creates  new  and  more  complicated  ones.""  As  someone  who  stands  here  as  a  direct   consequence  of  Dr.  King's  life  work,  I  am  living  testimony  to  the  moral  force  of  non  violence.  I   know  there's  nothing  weak,  nothing  passive,  nothing  na  ve  in  the  creed  and  lives  of  Gandhi   and  King.   But  as  a  head  of  state  sworn  to  protect  and  defend  my  nation,  I  cannot  be  guided  by  their   examples  alone.  I  face  the  world  as  it  is  and  cannot  stand  idle  in  the  face  of  threats  to  the   American  people.  For  make  no  mistake:  Evil  does  exist  in  the  world.  A  non  violent  movement   could  not  have  halted  Hitler's  armies.  Negotiations  cannot  convince  al  Qaeda's  leaders  to  lay   down  their  arms.  To  say  that  force  may  sometimes  be  necessary  is  not  a  call  to  cynicism.  It  is   a  recognition  of  history,  the  imperfections  of  man,  and  the  limits  of  reason.   I  raise  this  point,  I  begin  with  this  point  because  in  many  countries  there  is  a  deep   ambivalence  about  military  action  today        no  matter  what  the  cause.  And  at  times,  this  is   joined  by  a  reflexive  suspicion  of  America,  the  world's  sole  military  superpower.   Yet,  the  world  must  remember  that  it  was  not  simply  international  institutions        not  just   treaties  and  declarations        that  brought  stability  to  a  post  World  War  II  world.  Whatever   mistakes  we  have  made,  the  plain  fact  is  this:  The  United  States  of  America  has  helped   underwrite  global  security  for  more  than  six  decades  with  the  blood  of  our  citizens  and  the   strength  of  our  arms.   The  service  and  sacrifice  of  our  men  and  women  in  uniform  has   promoted  peace  and  prosperity  from  Germany  to  Korea,  and  enabled  democracy  to  take  hold   in  places  like  the  Balkans.  We  have  borne  this  burden  not  because  we  seek  to  impose  our   will.  We  have  done  so  out  of  enlightened  self  interest        because  we  seek  a  better  future  for   our  children  and  grandchildren,  and  we  believe  that  their  lives  will  be  better  if  others'  children   and  grandchildren  can  live  in  freedom  and  prosperity.   So  yes,  the  instruments  of  war  do  have  a  role  to  play  in  preserving  the  peace.  And  yet  this   truth  must  coexist  with  another:  that  no  matter  how  justified,  war  promises  human   tragedy.  The  soldier's  courage  and  sacrifice  is  full  of  glory        expressing  devotion  to  country,   to  cause,  to  comrades  in  arms.  But  war  itself  is  never  glorious    and  we  must  never  trumpet  it   as  such. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Copyright  Status:  Restricted,  seek  permission.    2010   Page  3      So  part  of  our  challenge  is  reconciling  these  two  seemingly  irreconcilable  truths:  that  war  is   sometimes  necessary    and  war  at  some  level  is  an  expression  of  human  folly.  Concretely,  we   must  direct  our  effort  to  the  task  that  President  Kennedy  called  for  long  ago.  ""Let  us  focus,""   he  said,  ""on  a  more  practical,  more  attainable  peace,  based  not  on  a  sudden  revolution  in   human  nature  but  on  a  gradual  evolution  in  human  institutions.""   A  gradual  evolution  of  human  institutions.   What  might  this  evolution  look  like?   What  might  these  practical  steps  be?   To  begin  with,  I  believe  that  all  nations,  strong  and  weak  alike,  must  adhere  to  standards  that   govern  the  use  of  force.  I,  like  any  head  of  state,  reserve  the  right  to  act  unilaterally  if   necessary  to  defend  my  nation.  Nevertheless,  I  am  convinced  that  adhering  to  standards,   international  standards,  strengthens  those  who  do  and  isolates  and  weakens  those  who  don't.   The  world  rallied  around  America  after  the  9/11  attacks  and  continues  to  support  our  efforts  in   Afghanistan,  because  of  the  horror  of  those  senseless  attacks  and  the  recognized  principle  of   self  defense.  Likewise,  the  world  recognized  the  need  to  confront  Saddam  Hussein  when  he   invaded  Kuwait        a  consensus  that  sent  a  clear  message  to  all  about  the  cost  of  aggression.   Furthermore,  America        in  fact,  no  nation        can  insist  that  others  follow  the  rules  of  the  road   if  we  refuse  to  follow  them  ourselves.  For  when  we  don't,  our  actions  appear  arbitrary  and   undercut  the  legitimacy  of  future  interventions,  no  matter  how  justified.   And  this  becomes  particularly  important  when  the  purpose  of  military  action  extends  beyond   self  defense  or  the  defense  of  one  nation  against  an  aggressor.  More  and  more,  we  all   confront  difficult  questions  about  how  to  prevent  the  slaughter  of  civilians  by  their  own   government,  or  to  stop  a  civil  war  whose  violence  and  suffering  can  engulf  an  entire  region.   I  believe  that  force  can  be  justified  on  humanitarian  grounds,  as  it  was  in  the  Balkans,  or  in   other  places  that  have  been  scarred  by  war.  Inaction  tears  at  our  conscience  and  can  lead  to   more  costly  intervention  later.  That's  why  all  responsible  nations  must  embrace  the  role  that   militaries  with  a  clear  mandate  can  play  to  keep  the  peace.   America's  commitment  to  global  security  will  never  waver.  But  in  a  world  in  which  threats  are   more  diffuse  and  missions  more  complex  America  cannot  act  alone.  America  alone  cannot   secure  the  peace.  This  is  true  in  Afghanistan.  This  is  true  in  failed  states  like  Somalia,  where   terrorism  and  piracy  is  joined  by  famine  and  human  suffering.  And  sadly,  it  will  continue  to  be   true  in  unstable  regions  for  years  to  come.  The  leaders  and  soldiers  of  NATO  countries,  and   other  friends  and  allies,  demonstrate  this  truth  through  the  capacity  and  courage  they've   shown  in  Afghanistan.  But  in  many  countries,  there  is  a  disconnect  between  the  efforts  of   those  who  serve  and  the  ambivalence  of  the  broader  public. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Copyright  Status:  Restricted,  seek  permission.    2010   Page  4      I  understand  why  war  is  not  popular,  but  I  also  know  this:  The  belief  that  peace  is  desirable  is   rarely  enough  to  achieve  it.  Peace  requires  responsibility.  Peace  entails  sacrifice.   That's  why  NATO  continues  to  be  indispensable.  That's  why  we  must  strengthen  U.N.  and   regional  peacekeeping,  and  not  leave  the  task  to  a  few  countries.  That's  why  we  honor  those   who  return  home  from  peacekeeping  and  training  abroad  to  Oslo  and  Rome,  to  Ottawa  and   Sydney,  to  Dhaka  and  Kigali.  We  honor  them  not  as  makers  of  war,  but  as  wagers  of  peace.   Let  me  make  one  final  point  about  the  use  of  force.  Even  as  we  make  difficult  decisions  about   going  to  war,  we  must  also  think  clearly  about  how  we  fight  it.  The  Nobel  Committee   recognized  this  truth  in  awarding  its  first  prize  for  peace  to  Henry  Dunant        the  founder  of  the   Red  Cross,  and  a  driving  force  behind  the  Geneva  Conventions.   Where  force  is  necessary,  we  have  a  moral  and  strategic  interest  in  binding  ourselves  to   certain  rules  of  conduct.  And  even  as  we  confront  a  vicious  adversary  that  abides  by  no  rules,   I  believe  the  United  States  of  America  must  remain  a  standard  bearer  in  the  conduct  of  war.   That  is  what  makes  us  different  from  those  whom  we  fight.  That  is  a  source  of  our   strength.  That  is  why  I  prohibited  torture.  That  is  why  I  ordered  the  prison  at  Guantanamo   Bay  closed.  And  that  is  why  I  have  reaffirmed  America's  commitment  to  abide  by  the  Geneva   Conventions.  We  lose  ourselves  when  we  compromise  the  very  ideals  that  we  fight  to   defend.  And  we  honor  those  ideals  by  upholding  them  not  when  it's  easy,  but  when  it  is  hard.   I've  spoken  at  some  length  to  the  question  that  must  weigh  on  our  minds  and  our  hearts  as   we  choose  to  wage  war.  But  let  me  now  turn  to  our  effort  to  avoid  such  tragic  choices,  and   speak  of  three  ways  that  we  can  build  a  just  and  lasting  peace.   First,  in  dealing  with  those  nations  that  break  rules  and  laws,  I  believe  that  we  must  develop   alternatives  to  violence  that  are  tough  enough  to  actually  change  behavior.  For  if  we  want  a   lasting  peace,  then  the  words  of  the  international  community  must  mean  something.  Those   regimes  that  break  the  rules  must  be  held  accountable.  Sanctions  must  exact  a  real  price.   Intransigence  must  be  met  with  increased  pressure        and  such  pressure  exists  only  when  the   world  stands  together  as  one.   One  urgent  example  is  the  effort  to  prevent  the  spread  of  nuclear  weapons,  and  to  seek  a   world  without  them.  In  the  middle  of  the  last  century,  nations  agreed  to  be  bound  by  a  treaty   whose  bargain  is  clear:  All  will  have  access  to  peaceful  nuclear  power    those  without  nuclear   weapons  will  forsake  them    and  those  with  nuclear  weapons  will  work  towards  disarmament.  I   am  committed  to  upholding  this  treaty.  It  is  a  centerpiece  of  my  foreign  policy.  And  I'm   working  with  President  Medvedev  to  reduce  America  and  Russia's  nuclear  stockpiles.   But  it  is  also  incumbent  upon  all  of  us  to  insist  that  nations  like  Iran  and  North  Korea  do  not   game  the  system.  Those  who  claim  to  respect  international  law  cannot  avert  their  eyes  when   those  laws  are  flouted.  Those  who  care  for  their  own  security  cannot  ignore  the  danger  of  an   arms  race  in  the  Middle  East  or  East  Asia.  Those  who  seek  peace  cannot  stand  idly  by  as   nations  arm  themselves  for  nuclear  war. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Copyright  Status:  Restricted,  seek  permission.    2010   Page  5      The  same  principle  applies  to  those  who  violate  international  laws  by  brutalizing  their  own   people.  When  there  is  genocide  in  Darfur,  systematic  rape  in  Congo,  repression  in  Burma         there  must  be  consequences.  Yes,  there  will  be  engagement.  Yes,  there  will  be  diplomacy.  But   there  must  be  consequences  when  those  things  fail.  And  the  closer  we  stand  together,  the   less  likely  we  will  be  faced  with  the  choice  between  armed  intervention  and  complicity  in   oppression.   This  brings  me  to  a  second  point:  the  nature  of  the  peace  that  we  seek.  For  peace  is  not   merely  the  absence  of  visible  conflict.  Only  a  just  peace  based  on  the  inherent  rights  and   dignity  of  every  individual  can  truly  be  lasting.  It  was  this  insight  that  drove  drafters  of  the   Universal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights  after  the  Second  World  War.  In  the  wake  of   devastation,  they  recognized  that  if  human  rights  are  not  protected,  peace  is  a  hollow   promise.   And  yet,  too  often  these  words  are  ignored.  For  some  countries,  the  failure  to  uphold  human   rights  is  excused  by  the  false  suggestion  that  these  are  somehow  Western  principles,  foreign   to  local  cultures  or  stages  of  a  nation's  development.  And  within  America,  there's  long  been  a   tension  between  those  who  describe  themselves  as  realists  or  idealists        a  tension  that   suggests  a  stark  choice  between  the  narrow  pursuit  of  interests  or  an  endless  campaign  to   impose  our  values  around  the  world.   I  reject  these  choices.  I  believe  that  peace  is  unstable  where  citizens  are  denied  the  right  to   speak  freely  or  worship  as  they  please    choose  their  own  leaders  or  assemble  without  fear.   Pent  up  grievances  fester,  and  the  suppression  of  tribal  and  religious  identity  can  lead  to   violence.  We  also  know  that  the  opposite  is  true.  Only  when  Europe  became  free  did  it  finally   find  peace.  America  has  never  fought  a  war  against  a  democracy,  and  our  closest  friends  are   governments  that  protect  the  rights  of  their  citizens.  No  matter  how  callously  defined,  neither   America's  interests        nor  the  world's        are  served  by  the  denial  of  human  aspirations.   So  even  as  we  respect  the  unique  culture  and  traditions  of  different  countries,  America  will   always  be  a  voice  for  those  aspirations  that  are  universal.  We  will  bear  witness  to  the  quiet   dignity  of  reformers  like  Aung  Sang  Suu  Kyi,  to  the  bravery  of  Zimbabweans  who  cast  their   ballots  in  the  face  of  beatings,  to  the  hundreds  of  thousands  who  have  marched  silently   through  the  streets  of  Iran.  It  is  telling  that  the  leaders  of  these  governments  fear  the   aspirations  of  their  own  people  more  than  the  power  of  any  other  nation.  And  it  is  the   responsibility  of  all  free  people  and  free  nations  to  make  clear  that  these  movements  of  hope   and  history        they  have  us  on  their  side.   Let  me  also  say  this:  The  promotion  of  human  rights  cannot  be  about  exhortation  alone.  At   times,  it  must  be  coupled  with  painstaking  diplomacy.  I  know  that  engagement  with   repressive  regimes  lacks  the  satisfying  purity  of  indignation.  But  I  also  know  that  sanctions   without  outreach        condemnation  without  discussion        can  carry  forward  only  a  crippling   status  quo.  No  repressive  regime  can  move  down  a  new  path  unless  it  has  the  choice  of  an   open  door. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.

Pope  John  Paul's  engagement  with  Poland  created   space  not  just  for  the  Catholic  Church,  but  for  labor  leaders  like  Lech  Walesa.  Ronald  Reagan's   efforts  on  arms  control  and  embrace  of  perestroika  not  only  improved  relations  with  the  Soviet   Union,  but  empowered  dissidents  throughout  Eastern  Europe.  There's  no  simple  formula  here.   But  we  must  try  as  best  we  can  to  balance  isolation  and  engagement,  pressure  and  incentives,   so  that  human  rights  and  dignity  are  advanced  over  time.   Third,  a  just  peace  includes  not  only  civil  and  political  rights        it  must  encompass  economic   security  and  opportunity.  For  true  peace  is  not  just  freedom  from  fear,  but  freedom  from   want.  It  is  undoubtedly  true  that  development  rarely  takes  root  without  security    it  is  also  true   that  security  does  not  exist  where  human  beings  do  not  have  access  to  enough  food,  or  clean   water,  or  the  medicine  and  shelter  they  need  to  survive.  It  does  not  exist  where  children  can't   aspire  to  a  decent  education  or  a  job  that  supports  a  family.  The  absence  of  hope  can  rot  a   society  from  within.   And  that's  why  helping  farmers  feed  their  own  people,  or  nations  educate  their  children  and   care  for  the  sick,  is  not  mere  charity.  It's  also  why  the  world  must  come  together  to  confront   climate  change.  There  is  little  scientific  dispute  that  if  we  do  nothing,  we  will  face  more   drought,  more  famine,  more  mass  displacement        all  of  which  will  fuel  more  conflict  for   decades.  For  this  reason,  it  is  not  merely  scientists  and  environmental  activists  who  call  for   swift  and  forceful  action.  It's  military  leaders  in  my  own  country  and  others  who  understand   our  common  security  hangs  in  the  balance.   Agreements  among  nations.  Strong  institutions.  Support  for  human  rights.  Investments  in   development.  All  these  are  vital  ingredients  in  bringing  about  the  evolution  that  President   Kennedy  spoke  about.  And  yet,  I  do  not  believe  that  we  will  have  the  will,  the  determination,   the  staying  power,  to  complete  this  work  without  something  more    and  that's  the  continued   expansion  of  our  moral  imagination        an  insistence  that  there's  something  irreducible  that  we   all  share.   As  the  world  grows  smaller,  you  might  think  it  would  be  easier  for  human  beings  to  recognize   how  similar  we  are        to  understand  that  we're  all  basically  seeking  the  same  things,  that  we   all  hope  for  the  chance  to  live  out  our  lives  with  some  measure  of  happiness  and  fulfillment  for   ourselves  and  our  families.   And  yet,  somehow,  given  the  dizzying  pace  of  globalization,  the  cultural  leveling  of  modernity,   it  perhaps  comes  as  no  surprise  that  people  fear  the  loss  of  what  they  cherish  in  their   particular  identities        their  race,  their  tribe,  and  perhaps  most  powerfully  their  religion.  In   some  places,  this  fear  has  led  to  conflict.  At  times,  it  even  feels  like  we're  moving  backwards.   We  see  it  in  the  Middle  East,  as  the  conflict  between  Arabs  and  Jews  seems  to  harden.  We  see   it  in  nations  that  are  torn  asunder  by  tribal  lines.

Copyright  Status:  Restricted,  seek  permission.    2010   Page  7      And  most  dangerously,  we  see  it  in  the  way  that  religion  is  used  to  justify  the  murder  of   innocents  by  those  who  have  distorted  and  defiled  the  great  religion  of  Islam,  and  who   attacked  my  country  from  Afghanistan.  These  extremists  are  not  the  first  to  kill  in  the  name  of   God.  The  cruelties  of  the  Crusades  are  amply  recorded.  But  they  remind  us  that  no  Holy  War   can  ever  be  a  just  war.  For  if  you  truly  believe  that  you  are  carrying  out  divine  will,  then  there   is  no  need  for  restraint        no  need  to  spare  the  pregnant  mother,  or  the  medic,  or  the  Red   Cross  worker,  or  even  a  person  of  one   s  own  faith.   Such  a  warped  view  of  religion  is  not  just  incompatible  with  the  concept  of  peace,  but  I   believe  it's  incompatible  with  the  very  purpose  of  faith:  For  the  one  rule  that  lies  at  the  heart   of  every  major  religion  is  that  we  do  unto  others  as  we  would  have  them  do  unto  us.  Adhering   to  this  law  of  love  has  always  been  the  core  struggle  of  human  nature.  For  we  are  fallible.  We   make  mistakes,  and  fall  victim  to  the  temptations  of  pride,  and  power,  and  sometimes  evil.   Even  those  of  us  with  the  best  of  intentions  will  at  times  fail  to  right  the  wrongs  before  us.   But  we  do  not  have  to  think  that  human  nature  is  perfect  for  us  to  still  believe  that  the  human   condition  can  be  perfected.  We  do  not  have  to  live  in  an  idealized  world  to  still  reach  for  those   ideals  that  will  make  it  a  better  place.  The  non  violence  practiced  by  men  like  Gandhi  and  King   may  not  have  been  practical  or  possible  in  every  circumstance,  but  the  love  that  they   preached        their  fundamental  faith  in  human  progress        that  must  always  be  the  North  Star   that  guides  us  on  our  journey.   For  if  we  lose  that  faith        if  we  dismiss  it  as  silly  or  na  ve    if  we  divorce  it  from  the  decisions   that  we  make  on  issues  of  war  and  peace        then  we  lose  what's  best  about  humanity.  We   lose  our  sense  of  possibility.  We  lose  our  moral  compass.   Like  generations  have  before  us,  we  must  reject  that  future.  As  Dr.  King  said  at  this  occasion   so  many  years  ago,  ""I  refuse  to  accept  despair  as  the  final  response  to  the  ambiguities  of   history.  I  refuse  to  accept  the  idea  that  the  'isness'  of  man's  present  condition  makes  him   morally  incapable  of  reaching  up  for  the  eternal  'oughtness'  that  forever  confronts  him.""  Let  us   reach  for  the  world  that  ought  to  be        that  spark  of  the  divine  that  still  stirs  within  each  of  our   souls.   Somewhere  today,  in  the  here  and  now,  in  the  world  as  it  is,  a  soldier  sees  he's  outgunned,   but  stands  firm  to  keep  the  peace.  Somewhere  today,  in  this  world,  a  young  protestor  awaits   the  brutality  of  her  government,  but  has  the  courage  to  march  on.  Somewhere  today,  a   mother  facing  punishing  poverty  still  takes  the  time  to  teach  her  child,  scrapes  together  what   few  coins  she  has  to  send  that  child  to  school        because  she  believes  that  a  cruel  world  still   has  a  place  for  that  child's  dreams.   Let  us  live  by  their  example.  We  can  acknowledge  that  oppression  will  always  be  with  us,  and   still  strive  for  justice.  We  can  admit  the  intractability  of  depravation,  and  still  strive  for   dignity.  Clear  eyed,  we  can  understand  that  there  will  be  war,  and  still  strive  for  peace.  We   can  do  that        for  that  is  the  story  of  human  progress    that's  the  hope  of  all  the  world    and  at   this  moment  of  challenge,  that  must  be  our  work  here  on  Earth.

"Good morning. It is an honor for me to join this distinguished group of leaders from nationsaround the world. We come here in Copenhagen because climate change poses a grave andgrowing danger to our people. All of you would not be here unless you -- like me -- wereconvinced that this danger is real. This is not fiction, it is science. Unchecked, climate changewill pose unacceptable risks to our security, our economies, and our planet. This much weknow. The question, then, before us is no longer the nature of the challenge. The question is ourcapacity to meet it. For while the reality of climate change is not in doubt, I have to behonest, as the world watches us today, I think our ability to take collective action is in doubtright now, and it hangs in the balance. I believe we can act boldly, and decisively, in the face of a common threat. That's why I comehere today -- not to talk, but to act. Now, as the world's largest economy and as the world's second largest emitter, America bearsour responsibility to address climate change, and we intend to meet that responsibility. That'swhy we've renewed our leadership within international climate change negotiations. That'swhy we've worked with other nations to phase out fossil fuel subsidies. That's why we've taken bold action at home -- by making historic investments in renewableenergy; by putting our people to work increasing efficiency in our homes and buildings; andby pursuing comprehensive legislation to transform to a clean energy economy. These mitigation actions are ambitious, and we are taking them not simply to meet globalresponsibilities. We are convinced, as some of you may be convinced, that changing the waywe produce and use energy is essential to America's economic future -- that it will createmillions of new jobs, power new industries, keep us competitive, and spark new innovation.We're convinced, for our own self-interest, that the way we use energy, changing it to a moreefficient fashion, is essential to our national security, because it helps to reduce ourdependence on foreign oil, and helps us deal with some of the dangers posed by climatechange. So I want this plenary session to understand, America is going to continue on this course ofaction to mitigate our emissions and to move towards a clean energy economy, no matterwhat happens here in Copenhagen. We think it is good for us, as well as good for the world.But we also believe that we will all be stronger, all be safer, all be more secure if we acttogether. That's why it is in our mutual interest to achieve a global accord in which we agreeto certain steps, and to hold each other accountable to certain commitments. After months of talk, after two weeks of negotiations, after innumerable side meetings,bilateral meetings, endless hours of discussion among negotiators, I believe that the pieces ofthat accord should now be clear. First, all major economies must put forward decisive national actions that will reduce theiremissions, and begin to turn the corner on climate change. I'm pleased that many of us havealready done so. Almost all the major economies have put forward legitimate targets,significant targets, ambitious targets. And I'm confident that America will fulfill thecommitments that we have made: cutting our emissions in the range of 17 percent by 2020,and by more than 80 percent by 2050 in line with final legislation. Second, we must have a mechanism to review whether we are keeping our commitments, andexchange this information in a transparent manner. These measures need not be intrusive, orinfringe upon sovereignty. They must, however, ensure that an accord is credible, and thatwe're living up to our obligations. Without such accountability, any agreement would be emptywords on a page. I don't know how you have an international agreement where we all are not sharinginformation and ensuring that we are meeting our commitments. That doesn't make sense. Itwould be a hollow victory. Number three, we must have financing that helps developing countries adapt, particularly theleast developed and most vulnerable countries to climate change. America will be a part offast-start funding that will ramp up to $10 billion by 2012. And yesterday, Secretary HillaryClinton, my Secretary of State, made it clear that we will engage in a global effort to mobilize$100 billion in financing by 2020, if -- and only if -- it is part of a broader accord that I havejust described. Mitigation. Transparency. Financing. It's a clear formula -- one that embraces the principle ofcommon but differentiated responses and respective capabilities. And it adds up to asignificant accord -- one that takes us farther than we have ever gone before as aninternational community. I just want to say to this plenary session that we are running short on time. And at this point,the question is whether we will move forward together or split apart, whether we preferposturing to action. I'm sure that many consider this an imperfect framework that I justdescribed. No country will get everything that it wants. There are those developing countriesthat want aid with no strings attached, and no obligations with respect to transparency. Theythink that the most advanced nations should pay a higher price. I understand that. There arethose advanced nations who think that developing countries either cannot absorb thisassistance, or that will not be held accountable effectively, and that the world's fastest- growing emitters should bear a greater share of the burden. We know the fault lines because we've been imprisoned by them for years. Theseinternational discussions have essentially taken place now for almost two decades, and wehave very little to show for it other than an increased acceleration of the climate changephenomenon. The time for talk is over. This is the bottom line: We can embrace this accord,take a substantial step forward, continue to refine it and build upon its foundation. We can dothat, and everyone who is in this room will be part of a historic endeavor -- one that makeslife better for our children and our grandchildren. Or we can choose delay, falling back into the same divisions that have stood in the way ofaction for years. And we will be back having the same stale arguments month after month,year after year, perhaps decade after decade, all while the danger of climate change growsuntil it is irreversible. Ladies and gentlemen, there is no time to waste. America has made our choice. We havecharted our course. We have made our commitments. We will do what we say. Now I believeit's the time for the nations and the people of the world to come together behind a commonpurpose. We are ready to get this done today -- but there has to be movement on all sides torecognize that it is better for us to act than to talk; it   s better for us to choose action overinaction; the future over the past -- and with courage and faith, I believe that we can meetour responsibility to our people, and the future of our planet. Thank you very much.",obama
"Good morning, everybody. I wanted to take just a few minutes to update the American peopleon the attempted terrorist attack that occurred on Christmas Day and the steps we're takingto ensure the safety and security of the country. The investigation's ongoing. And I spoke again this morning with Attorney General Eric Holder,the secretary of homeland security, Janet Napolitano, and my counterterrorism and homelandsecurity adviser, John Brennan. I asked them to keep -- continue monitoring the situation tokeep the American people and members of Congress informed. Now, here's what we know so far: On Christmas Day, Northwest Airlines Flight 253 was enroute from Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Detroit. As the plane made its final approach toDetroit Metropolitan Airport, a passenger allegedly tried to ignite an explosive device on hisbody, setting off a fire. Thanks to the quick and heroic actions of passengers and crew, thesuspect was immediately subdued, the fire was put out, and the plane landed safely. Thesuspect is now in custody and has been charged with attempting to destroy an aircraft. And afull investigation has been launched into this attempted act of terrorism, and we will not restuntil we find all who were involved and hold them accountable. Now, this was a serious reminder of the dangers that we face and the nature of those whothreaten our homeland. Had the suspect succeeded in bringing down that plane, it could havekilled nearly 300 passengers and crew, innocent civilians preparing to celebrate the holidayswith their families and friends. The American people should be assured that we are doingeverything in our power to keep you and your family safe and secure during this busy holidayseason. Since I was first notified of this incident, I've ordered the following actions to be taken toprotect the American people and to secure air travel. First, I directed that we take immediate steps to ensure the safety of the traveling public. Wemade sure that all flights still in the air were secure and could land safely. We immediatelyenhanced screening and security procedures for all flights, domestic and international. Weadded federal air marshals to flights entering and leaving the United States. And we'reworking closely in this country, federal, state and local law enforcement, with our internationalpartners. Second, I've ordered two important reviews, because it's absolutely critical that we learn fromthis incident and take the necessary measures to prevent future acts of terrorism. The first review involves our watch list system, which our government has had in place formany years to identify known and suspected terrorists so that we can prevent their entry intothe United States. Apparently the suspect in the Christmas incident was in this system, butnot on a watch list, such as the so-called no-fly list. So I have ordered a thorough review, notonly of how information related to the subject was handled, but of the overall watch listsystem and how it can be strengthened. The second review will examine all screening policies, technologies, and procedures related toair travel. We need to determine just how the suspect was able to bring dangerous explosivesaboard an aircraft and what additional steps we can take to thwart future attacks. Third, I've directed my national security team to keep up the pressure on those who wouldattack our country. We do not yet have all the answers about this latest attempt, but thosewho would slaughter innocent men, women, and children must know that the United Stateswill more -- do more than simply strengthen our defenses. We will continue to use everyelement of our national power to disrupt, to dismantle, and defeat the violent extremists whothreaten us, whether they are from Afghanistan or Pakistan, Yemen or Somalia, or anywherewhere they are plotting attacks against the U.S. homeland. Finally, the American people should remain vigilant, but also be confident. Those plottingagainst us seek not only to undermine our security, but also the open society and the valuesthat we cherish as Americans. This incident, like several that have preceded it, demonstratesthat an alert and courageous citizenry are far more resilient than an isolated extremist. As a nation, we will do everything in our power to protect our country. As Americans, we willnever give in to fear or division. We will be guided by our hopes, our unity, and our deeplyheld values. That's who we are as Americans. That's what our brave men and women in uniform are standing up for as they spend theholidays in harm's way. And we will continue to do everything that we can to keep America safe in the new year andbeyond. Before I leave, let me also briefly address the events that have taken place over the last fewdays in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The United States joins with the international communityin strongly condemning the violent and unjust suppression of innocent Iranian citizens, whichhas apparently resulted in detentions, injuries, and even death. For months, the Iranian people have sought nothing more than to exercise their universalrights. Each time they have done so, they have been met with the iron fist of brutality, evenon solemn occasions and holy days. And each time that has happened, the world has watchedwith deep admiration for the courage and the conviction of the Iranian people who are part ofIran's great and enduring civilization. What's taking place within Iran is not about the United States or any other country. It's aboutthe Iranian people and their aspirations for justice and a better life for themselves. And thedecision of Iran's leaders to govern through fear and tyranny will not succeed in making thoseaspirations go away. As I said in Oslo, it's telling when governments fear the aspirations [of] their own people morethan the power of any other nation. Along with all free nations, the United States stands with those who seek their universalrights. We call upon the Iranian government to abide by the international obligations that ithas to respect the rights of its own people. We call for the immediate release of all who have been unjustly detained within Iran. We will continue to bear witness to the extraordinary events that are taking place there. AndI'm confident that history will be on the side of those who seek justice. Thank you very much, everybody. And happy New Year.",obama
"I just concluded a meeting with members of my national security team, including those fromour intelligence, homeland security and law enforcement agencies involved in the securityreviews that I ordered after the failed attack on Christmas Day. I called these leaders to the White House because we face a challenge of the utmosturgency. As we saw on Christmas, al Qaeda and its extremist allies will stop at nothing in theirefforts to kill Americans. And we are determined not only to thwart those plans, but todisrupt, dismantle and defeat their networks once and for all. Indeed, over the past year, we've taken the fight to al Qaeda and its allies wherever they plotand train, be it in Afghanistan and Pakistan, in Yemen and Somalia, or in other countriesaround the world. Here at home, our intelligence, homeland security and law enforcement agencies have workedtogether with considerable success: gathering intelligence, stitching it together, and makingarrests -- from Denver to Texas, from Illinois to New York -- disrupting plots and savingAmerican lives. And these successes have not come without a price, as we saw last week inthe loss of our courageous CIA officers in Afghanistan. But when a suspected terrorist is able to board a plane with explosives on Christmas Day thesystem has failed in a potentially disastrous way. And it's my responsibility to find out why,and to correct that failure so that we can prevent such attacks in the future. And that's why, shortly after the attempted bombing over Detroit, I ordered two reviews. Idirected Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano to review aviation screening,technology and procedures. She briefed me on her initial findings today, and I'm pleased thatthis review is drawing on the best science and technology, including the expertise of Secretaryof Energy Steven Chu and his department. I also directed my counterterrorism and homeland security advisor John Brennan to lead athorough review into our terrorist watch-listing system so we can fix what went wrong. As wediscussed today, this ongoing review continues to reveal more about the human and systemicfailures that almost cost nearly 300 lives. We will make a summary of this preliminary reportpublic within the next few days, but let me share some of what we know so far. As I described over the weekend, elements of our intelligence community knew that UmarFarouk Abdulmutallab had traveled to Yemen and joined up with extremists there. It nowturns out that our intelligence community knew of other red flags -- that al Qaeda in theArabian Peninsula sought to strike not only American targets in Yemen, but the United Statesitself. And we had information that this group was working with an individual who was known-- who we now know was in fact the individual involved in the Christmas attack. The bottom line is this: The U.S. government had sufficient information to have uncoveredthis plot and potentially disrupt the Christmas Day attack. But our intelligence communityfailed to connect those dots, which would have placed the suspect on the ""no fly"" list. In otherwords, this was not a failure to collect intelligence; it was a failure to integrate andunderstand the intelligence that we already had. The information was there. Agencies andanalysts who needed it had access to it. And our professionals were trained to look for it andto bring it all together. Now, I will accept that intelligence, by its nature, is imperfect, but it is increasingly clear thatintelligence was not fully analyzed or fully leveraged. That's not acceptable, and I will nottolerate it. Time and again, we've learned that quickly piecing together information andtaking swift action is critical to staying one step ahead of a nimble adversary. So we have to do better -- and we will do better. And we have to do it quickly. Americanlives are on the line. So I made it clear today to my team: I want our initial reviewscompleted this week. I want specific recommendations for corrective actions to fix what wentwrong. I want those reforms implemented immediately, so that this doesn't happen againand so we can prevent future attacks. And I know that every member of my team that I metwith today understands the urgency of getting this right. And I appreciate that each of themtook responsibility for the shortfalls within their own agencies. Immediately after the attack, I ordered concrete steps to protect the American people: newscreening and security for all flights, domestic and international; more explosive detectionteams at airports; more air marshals on flights; and deepening cooperation with internationalpartners. In recent days, we've taken additional steps to improve security. Counterterrorism officialshave reviewed and updated our terrorist watch list system, including adding more individualsto the ""no fly"" list. And while our review has found that our watch-listing system is notbroken, the failure to add Abdulmutallab to the ""no fly"" list shows that this system needs to bestrengthened. The State Department is now requiring embassies and consulates to include current visainformation in their warning on individuals with terrorist or suspected terrorist connections. As of yesterday, the Transportation Security Administration, or TSA, is requiring enhancedscreening for passengers flying into the United States from, or flying through, nations on ourlist of state sponsors of terrorism, or other countries of interest. And in the days ahead, I willannounce further steps to disrupt attacks, including better integration of information andenhanced passenger screening for air travel. Finally, some have suggested that the events on Christmas Day should cause us to revisit thedecision to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. So let me be clear. It was always our intentto transfer detainees to other countries only under conditions that provide assurances that oursecurity is being protected. With respect to Yemen in particular, there's an ongoing security situation which we have beenconfronting for some time, along with our Yemeni partner. Given the unsettled situation, I'vespoken to the Attorney General and we've agreed that we will not be transferring additionaldetainees back to Yemen at this time. But make no mistake: We will close Guantanamo prison, which has damaged our nationalsecurity interests and become a tremendous recruiting tool for al Qaeda. In fact, that was anexplicit rationale for the formation of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. And, as I've alwayssaid, we will do so -- we will close the prison in a manner that keeps the American people safeand secure. Our reviews -- and the steps that we've taken and will continue to take -- go to the heart ofthe kind of intelligence and homeland security we need in the 21st century. Just as al Qaedaand its allies are constantly evolving and adapting their efforts to strike us, we have toconstantly adapt and evolve to defeat them, because as we saw on Christmas, the margin forerror is slim and the consequences of failure can be catastrophic. As these violent extremists pursue new havens, we intend to target al Qaeda wherever theytake root, forging new partnerships to deny them sanctuary, as we are doing currently withthe government in Yemen. As our adversaries seek new recruits, we'll constantly review andrapidly update our intelligence and our institutions. As they refine our tactics, we'll enhanceour defenses, including smarter screening and security at airports, and investing in thetechnologies that might have detected the kind of explosives used on Christmas. In short, we need our intelligence, homeland security and law enforcement systems -- and thepeople in them -- to be accountable and to work as intended: collecting, sharing, integrating,analyzing, and acting on intelligence as quickly and effectively as possible to save innocentlives -- not just most of the time, but all the time. That's what the American people deserve. As President, that's exactly what I will demand. Thank you very much.",obama
"Good afternoon, everybody. The immediate reviews that I ordered after the failed Christmasterrorist attack are now complete. I was just briefed on the findings and recommendations forreform, and I believe it's important that the American people understand the new steps thatwe're taking to prevent attacks and keep our country safe. This afternoon, my Counterterrorism and Homeland Security Advisor, John Brennan, willdiscuss his review into our terrorist watchlist system -- how our government failed to connectthe dots in a way that would have prevented a known terrorist from boarding a plane forAmerica, and the steps we're going to take to prevent that from happening again. Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano will discuss her review of aviation screening,technology and procedures -- how that terrorist boarded a plane with explosives that couldhave killed nearly 300 innocent people, and how we'll strengthen aviation security goingforward. So today I want to just briefly summarize their conclusions and the steps that I've ordered toaddress them. In our ever-changing world, America's first line of defense is timely, accurate intelligence thatis shared, integrated, analyzed, and acted upon quickly and effectively. That's what theintelligence reforms after the 9/11 attacks largely achieved. That's what our intelligencecommunity does every day. But, unfortunately, that's not what happened in the lead-up toChristmas Day. It's now clear that shortcomings occurred in three broad and compoundingways. First, although our intelligence community had learned a great deal about the al Qaedaaffiliate in Yemen -- called al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula -- that we knew that they soughtto strike the United States and that they were recruiting operatives to do so -- the intelligencecommunity did not aggressively follow up on and prioritize particular streams of intelligencerelated to a possible attack against the homeland. Second, this contributed to a larger failure of analysis -- a failure to connect the dots ofintelligence that existed across our intelligence community and which, together, could haverevealed that Abdulmutallab was planning an attack. Third, this, in turn, fed into shortcomings in the watch-listing system which resulted in thisperson not being placed on the ""no fly"" list, thereby allowing him to board that plane inAmsterdam for Detroit. In sum, the U.S. government had the information -- scattered throughout the system -- topotentially uncover this plot and disrupt the attack. Rather than a failure to collect or shareintelligence, this was a failure to connect and understand the intelligence that we already had. That's why we took swift action in the immediate days following Christmas, includingreviewing and updating the terrorist watchlist system and adding more individuals to the ""nofly"" list, and directing our embassies and consulates to include current visa information in theirwarnings of individuals with terrorist or suspected terrorist ties. Today, I'm directing a series of additional corrective steps across multiple agencies. Broadlyspeaking, they fall into four areas. First, I'm directing that our intelligence community immediately begin assigning specificresponsibility for investigating all leads on high-priority threats so that these leads arepursued and acted upon aggressively -- not just most of the time, but all of the time. Wemust follow the leads that we get. And we must pursue them until plots are disrupted. Andthat mean assigning clear lines of responsibility. Second, I'm directing that intelligence reports, especially those involving potential threats tothe United States, be distributed more rapidly and more widely. We can't sit on informationthat could protect the American people. Third, I'm directing that we strengthen the analytical process, how our analysis -- how ouranalysts process and integrate the intelligence that they receive. My Director of NationalIntelligence, Denny Blair, will take the lead in improving our day-to-day efforts. MyIntelligence Advisory Board will examine the longer-term challenge of sifting through vastuniverses of intelligence and data in our Information Age. And finally, I'm ordering an immediate effort to strengthen the criteria used to add individualsto our terrorist watchlists, especially the ""no fly"" list. We must do better in keeping dangerouspeople off airplanes, while still facilitating air travel. So taken together, these reforms will improve the intelligence community's ability to collect,share, integrate, analyze, and act on intelligence swiftly and effectively. In short, they willhelp our intelligence community do its job even better and protect American lives. But even the best intelligence can't identify in advance every individual who would do usharm. So we need the security -- at our airports, ports, and borders, and through ourpartnerships with other nations -- to prevent terrorists from entering America. At the Amsterdam airport, Abdulmutallab was subjected to the same screening as otherpassengers. He was required to show his documents -- including a valid U.S. visa. His carry- on bag was X-rayed. He passed through a metal detector. But a metal detector can't detectthe kind of explosives that were sewn into his clothes. As Secretary Napolitano will explain, the screening technologies that might have detectedthese explosives are in use at the Amsterdam airport, but not at the specific checkpoints thathe passed through. Indeed, most airports in the world -- and in the United States -- do notyet have these technologies. Now, there's no silver bullet to securing the thousands of flightsinto America each day, domestic and international. It will require significant investments inmany areas. And that's why, even before the Christmas attack, we increased investments inhomeland security and aviation security. This includes an additional one billion dollars in newsystems and technologies that we need to protect our airports -- more baggage screening,more passenger screening and more advanced explosive detection capabilities, including thosethat can improve our ability to detect the kind of explosive used on Christmas. These aremajor investments and they'll make our skies safer and more secure. As I announced this week, we've taken a whole range of steps to improve aviation screeningand security since Christmas, including new rules for how we handle visas within thegovernment and enhanced screening for passengers flying from, or through, certaincountries. And today, I'm directing that the Department of Homeland Security take additional steps,including: strengthening our international partnerships to improve aviation screening andsecurity around the world; greater use of the advanced explosive detection technologies thatwe already have, including imaging technology; and working aggressively, in cooperation with the Department of Energy and our National Labs, to develop and deploy the next generationof screening technologies. Now, there is, of course, no foolproof solution. As we develop new screening technologies andprocedures, our adversaries will seek new ways to evade them, as was shown by theChristmas attack. In the never-ending race to protect our country, we have to stay one stepahead of a nimble adversary. That's what these steps are designed to do. And we willcontinue to work with Congress to ensure that our intelligence, homeland security, and lawenforcement communities have the resources they need to keep the American people safe. I ordered these two immediate reviews so that we could take immediate action to secure ourcountry. But in the weeks and months ahead, we will continue a sustained and intensiveeffort of analysis and assessment, so that we leave no stone unturned in seeking better waysto protect the American people. I have repeatedly made it clear -- in public with the American people, and in private with mynational security team -- that I will hold my staff, our agencies and the people in themaccountable when they fail to perform their responsibilities at the highest levels. Now, at this stage in the review process it appears that this incident was not the fault of asingle individual or organization, but rather a systemic failure across organizations andagencies. That's why, in addition to the corrective efforts that I've ordered, I've directedagency heads to establish internal accountability reviews, and directed my national securitystaff to monitor their efforts. We will measure progress. And John Brennan will report back tome within 30 days and on a regular basis after that. All of these agencies -- and their leaders-- are responsible for implementing these reforms. And all will be held accountable if theydon't. Moreover, I am less interested in passing out blame than I am in learning from and correctingthese mistakes to make us safer. For ultimately, the buck stops with me. As President, Ihave a solemn responsibility to protect our nation and our people. And when the system fails,it is my responsibility. Over the past two weeks, we've been reminded again of the challenge we face in protectingour country against a foe that is bent on our destruction. And while passions and politics canoften obscure the hard work before us, let's be clear about what this moment demands. Weare at war. We are at war against al Qaeda, a far-reaching network of violence and hatredthat attacked us on 9/11, that killed nearly 3,000 innocent people, and that is plotting tostrike us again. And we will do whatever it takes to defeat them. And we've made progress. Al Qaeda's leadership is hunkered down. We have worked closelywith partners, including Yemen, to inflict major blows against al Qaeda leaders. And we havedisrupted plots at home and abroad, and saved American lives. And we know that the vast majority of Muslims reject al Qaeda. But it is clear that al Qaedaincreasingly seeks to recruit individuals without known terrorist affiliations not just in theMiddle East, but in Africa and other places, to do their bidding. That's why I've directed mynational security team to develop a strategy that addresses the unique challenges posed bylone recruits. And that's why we must communicate clearly to Muslims around the world thatal Qaeda offers nothing except a bankrupt vision of misery and death    - including the murderof fellow Muslims    - while the United States stands with those who seek justice and progress. To advance that progress, we've sought new beginnings with Muslim communities around theworld, one in which we engage on the basis of mutual interest and mutual respect, and worktogether to fulfill the aspirations that all people share -- to get an education, to work withdignity, to live in peace and security. That's what America believes in. That's the vision thatis far more powerful than the hatred of these violent extremists. Here at home, we will strengthen our defenses, but we will not succumb to a siege mentalitythat sacrifices the open society and liberties and values that we cherish as Americans,because great and proud nations don't hunker down and hide behind walls of suspicion andmistrust. That is exactly what our adversaries want, and so long as I am President, we willnever hand them that victory. We will define the character of our country, not some band ofsmall men intent on killing innocent men, women and children. And in this cause, every one of us -- every American, every elected official -- can do our part. Instead of giving into cynicism and division, let's move forward with the confidence andoptimism and unity that defines us as a people. For now is not a time for partisanship, it's atime for citizenship -- a time to come together and work together with the seriousness ofpurpose that our national security demands. That's what it means to be strong in the face of violent extremism. That's how we will prevailin this fight. And that's how we will protect our country and pass it -- safer and stronger -- tothe next generation. Thanks very much.",obama
"Thank you, everybody, for being here. As we all know, our country has endured the deepest recession we've faced ingenerations. And much of the turmoil was caused by irresponsibility on the part of banks andfinancial institutions. Firms took reckless risks in pursuit of short-term profits and soaringbonuses, triggering a financial crisis that nearly pulled the economy into a second GreatDepression. It was little more than a year ago that we stood on that precipice. Several of the world'slargest financial institutions had already failed. Credit markets froze and banks refused tolend. Trillions of dollars in household savings evaporated as stocks, pensions, and homevalues plummeted. And we were losing hundreds of thousands of jobs each month. It was atthis time that many large financial firms -- those left standing -- teetered on the brink ofcollapse, overwhelmed by the consequences of their irresponsible decisions. Now, even though these firms were largely facing a crisis of their own making, their failurecould have led to an even greater calamity for the country. So the Federal Reserve and otheragencies took emergency measures to prevent that outcome. And the previous Administrationstarted a program -- the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP -- to provide these financialinstitutions with funds to survive the turmoil that they had helped unleash. It was a distastefulbut necessary thing to do. Now, we've worked over the last year to manage this program effectively, to hold firmsaccountable, and to recoup as much tax money as possible. Many originally feared that mostof the 700 billion dollars in TARP money would be lost. But because of the management of thisprogram by Secretary Geithner and my economic team, we've now recovered the majority ofthe funds provided to banks. As far as I'm concerned, however, that's not good enough. My commitment is to thetaxpayer. My commitment is to recover every single dime the American people are owed. Andmy determination to achieve this goal is only heightened when I see reports of massive profitsand obscene bonuses at some of the very firms who owe their continued existence to theAmerican people -- folks who have not been made whole, and who continue to face realhardship in this recession. We want our money back. And we're going to get it. And that's why I'm proposing a ""Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee"" to be imposed on majorfinancial firms until the American people are fully compensated for the extraordinaryassistance they provided to Wall Street. If these companies are in good enough shape toafford massive bonuses, they are surely in good enough shape to afford paying back everypenny to taxpayers. Now, our estimate is that the TARP program will end up costing taxpayers around 117 billiondollars -- obviously a lot less than the 700 billion that people had feared, but still a lot ofmoney. The fee will be in place for 10 years, or as long as it takes to raise the full amountnecessary to cover all taxpayer losses. This will not be a cost borne by community banks orsmall financial firms. Only the largest firms with more than 50 billion dollars in assets will beaffected. And the size of the fee each bank owes will be based on its size and exposure todebt, so that we are recovering tax dollars while promoting reform of the banking practicesthat contributed to this crisis. Now, the fact is these financial institutions are essential to our economy. They provide capitaland credit to families purchasing homes, students attending college, businesses seeking tostart up or expand. And that's why the rescue program was as necessary as it wasunfortunate. And that is why, through this fee and broader reforms that we seek, our goal isnot to punish Wall Street firms, but rather to prevent the abuse and excess that nearly causedthe collapse of many of these firms and the financial system itself. We cannot go back to ""business as usual."" And when we see reports of firms once againengaging in risky bets to reap quick rewards, when we see a return to compensation practicesthat seem not to reflect what the country has been through, all that looks like business asusual to me. The financial industry has even launched a massive lobbying campaign, lockingarms with the opposition Party, to stand in the way of reforms to prevent another crisis. That,too, unfortunately, is business as usual. And we're already hearing a hue and cry from WallStreet suggesting that this proposed fee is not only unwelcome but unfair -- that by sometwisted logic it is more appropriate for the American people to bear the costs of the bailout,rather than the industry that benefited from it, even though these executives are out theregiving themselves huge bonuses. What I'd say to these executives is this: Instead of sending a phalanx of lobbyists to fight thisproposal, or employing an army of lawyers and accountants to help evade the fee, I suggestyou might want to consider simply meeting your responsibilities. And I'd urge you to cover thecosts of the rescue not by sticking it to your shareholders or your customers or fellow citizenswith the bill, but by rolling back bonuses for top earners and executives. And more broadly, Iam continuing to call on these firms to put greater effort into helping families stay in theirhomes, to provide small businesses with needed loans, and to embrace -- rather than fight --serious financial reform. Ultimately, it is by taking responsibility -- on Wall Street, here in Washington, all the way toMain Street -- that we're going to move past this period of turmoil. That's how we're going toavoid the cycles of boom and bust that have caused so much havoc. That's how we're going topromote vibrant markets that reward innovation and entrepreneurship and hard work. That'show we're going to create sustained growth without the looming threat of another costlycrisis. That's not only in the best interests of the economy as a whole; it's actually in theinterest of these large banks. So, I'm going to be working closely with Congress on this proposal. And on behalf of the American people, I look forward to signing it into law. Thank you very much.",obama
"Good morning. Praise be to God. Let me begin by thanking the entire Vermont AvenueBaptist Church family for welcoming our family here today. It feels like a family. Thank youfor making us feel that way. To Pastor Wheeler, first lady Wheeler, thank you so much forwelcoming us here today. Congratulations on Jordan Denice -- aka Cornelia. Michelle and I have been blessed with a new nephew this year as well -- Austin LucasRobinson. So maybe at the appropriate time we can make introductions. Now, if Jordan'sfather is like me, then that will be in about 30 years. That is a great blessing. Michelle and Malia and Sasha and I are thrilled to be here today. And I know that sometimesyou have to go through a little fuss to have me as a guest speaker. So let me apologize inadvance for all the fuss. We gather here, on a Sabbath, during a time of profound difficulty for our nation and for ourworld. In such a time, it soothes the soul to seek out the Divine in a spirit of prayer; to seeksolace among a community of believers. But we are not here just to ask the Lord for Hisblessing. We aren't here just to interpret His Scripture. We're also here to call on thememory of one of His noble servants, the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Now, it's fitting that we do so here, within the four walls of Vermont Avenue Baptist Church --here, in a church that rose like the phoenix from the ashes of the civil war; here in a churchformed by freed slaves, whose founding pastor had worn the union blue; here in a churchfrom whose pews congregants set out for marches and from whom choir anthems of freedomwere heard; from whose sanctuary King himself would sermonize from time to time. One of those times was Thursday, December 6, 1956. Pastor, you said you were a little olderthan me, so were you around at that point? You were three years old -- okay. I wasn   t bornyet. On Thursday, December 6, 1956. And before Dr. King had pointed us to the mountaintop,before he told us about his dream in front of the Lincoln Memorial, King came here, as a 27- year-old preacher, to speak on what he called ""The Challenge of a New Age."" ""The Challengeof a New Age."" It was a period of triumph, but also uncertainty, for Dr. King and his followers-- because just weeks earlier, the Supreme Court had ordered the desegregation ofMontgomery's buses, a hard-wrought, hard-fought victory that would put an end to the 381- day historic boycott down in Montgomery, Alabama. And yet, as Dr. King rose to take that pulpit, the future still seemed daunting. It wasn't clearwhat would come next for the movement that Dr. King led. It wasn't clear how we were goingto reach the Promised Land. Because segregation was still rife; lynchings still a fact. Yes, theSupreme Court had ruled not only on the Montgomery buses, but also on Brown v. Board ofEducation. And yet that ruling was defied throughout the South -- by schools and by states;they ignored it with impunity. And here in the nation's capital, the federal government hadyet to fully align itself with the laws on its books and the ideals of its founding. So it's not hard for us, then, to imagine that moment. We can imagine folks coming to thischurch, happy about the boycott being over. We can also imagine them, though, coming hereconcerned about their future, sometimes second-guessing strategy, maybe fighting off somecreeping doubts, perhaps despairing about whether the movement in which they had placedso many of their hopes -- a movement in which they believed so deeply -- could actuallydeliver on its promise. So here we are, more than half a century later, once again facing the challenges of a newage. Here we are, once more marching toward an unknown future, what I call the Joshuageneration to their Moses generation -- the great inheritors of progress paid for with sweatand blood, and sometimes life itself. We've inherited the progress of unjust laws that are now overturned. We take for granted theprogress of a ballot being available to anybody who wants to take the time to actually vote.We enjoy the fruits of prejudice and bigotry being lifted -- slowly, sometimes in fits and starts,but irrevocably -- from human hearts. It's that progress that made it possible for me to behere today; for the good people of this country to elect an African American the 44thPresident of the United States of America. Reverend Wheeler mentioned the inauguration, last year's election. You know, on the heels ofthat victory over a year ago, there were some who suggested that somehow we had enteredinto a post-racial America, all those problems would be solved. There were those who arguedthat because I had spoke of a need for unity in this country that our nation was somehowentering into a period of post-partisanship. That didn   t work out so well. There was a hopeshared by many that life would be better from the moment that I swore that oath. Of course, as we meet here today, one year later, we know the promise of that moment hasnot yet been fully fulfilled. Because of an era of greed and irresponsibility that sowed theseeds of its own demise, because of persistent economic troubles unaddressed through thegenerations, because of a banking crisis that brought the financial system to the brink ofcatastrophe, we are being tested -- in our own lives and as a nation -- as few have beentested before. Unemployment is at its highest level in more than a quarter of a century. Nowhere is it higherthan the African American community. Poverty is on the rise. Home ownership is slipping.Beyond our shores, our sons and daughters are fighting two wars. Closer to home, our Haitianbrothers and sisters are in desperate need. Bruised, battered, many people are legitimatelyfeeling doubt, even despair, about the future. Like those who came to this church on thatThursday in 1956, folks are wondering, where do we go from here? I understand those feelings. I understand the frustration and sometimes anger that so manyfolks feel as they struggle to stay afloat. I get letters from folks around the country everyday; I read 10 a night out of the 40,000 that we receive. And there are stories of hardshipand desperation, in some cases, pleading for help: I need a job. I'm about to lose my home. I don't have health care -- it's about to cause my family to be bankrupt. Sometimes you getletters from children: My mama or my daddy have lost their jobs, is there something you cando to help? Ten letters like that a day we read. So, yes, we're passing through a hard winter. It's the hardest in some time. But let's alwaysremember that, as a people, the American people, we've weathered some hard wintersbefore. This country was founded during some harsh winters. The fishermen, the laborers,the craftsmen who made camp at Valley Forge -- they weathered a hard winter. The slavesand the freedmen who rode an underground railroad, seeking the light of justice under thecover of night -- they weathered a hard winter. The seamstress whose feet were tired, thepastor whose voice echoes through the ages -- they weathered some hard winters. It was forthem, as it is for us, difficult, in the dead of winter, to sometimes see spring coming. They,too, sometimes felt their hopes deflate. And yet, each season, the frost melts, the coldrecedes, the sun reappears. So it was for earlier generations and so it will be for us. What we need to do is to just ask what lessons we can learn from those earlier generationsabout how they sustained themselves during those hard winters, how they persevered andprevailed. Let us in this Joshua generation learn how that Moses generation overcame. Let me offer a few thoughts on this. First and foremost, they did so by remaining firm in theirresolve. Despite being threatened by sniper fire or planted bombs, by shoving and punchingand spitting and angry stares, they adhered to that sweet spirit of resistance, the principles ofnonviolence that had accounted for their success. Second, they understood that as much as our government and our political parties hadbetrayed them in the past -- as much as our nation itself had betrayed its own ideals --government, if aligned with the interests of its people, can be -- and must be -- a force forgood. So they stayed on the Justice Department. They went into the courts. They pressuredCongress, they pressured their President. They didn   t give up on this country. They didn   tgive up on government. They didn   t somehow say government was the problem; they said,we're going to change government, we're going to make it better. Imperfect as it was, theycontinued to believe in the promise of democracy; in America's constant ability to remakeitself, to perfect this union. Third, our predecessors were never so consumed with theoretical debates that they couldn'tsee progress when it came. Sometimes I get a little frustrated when folks just don't want tosee that even if we don't get everything, we're getting something. King understood that thedesegregation of the Armed Forces didn   t end the civil rights movement, because black andwhite soldiers still couldn't sit together at the same lunch counter when they came home. Buthe still insisted on the rightness of desegregating the Armed Forces. That was a good firststep -- even as he called for more. He didn   t suggest that somehow by the signing of the CivilRights that somehow all discrimination would end. But he also didn   t think that we shouldn   tsign the Civil Rights Act because it hasn   t solved every problem. Let's take a victory, he said,and then keep on marching. Forward steps, large and small, were recognized for what theywere -- which was progress. Fourth, at the core of King's success was an appeal to conscience that touched hearts andopened minds, a commitment to universal ideals -- of freedom, of justice, of equality -- thatspoke to all people, not just some people. For King understood that without broad support,any movement for civil rights could not be sustained. That's why he marched with the whiteauto worker in Detroit. That's why he linked arm with the Mexican farm worker in California,and united people of all colors in the noble quest for freedom. Of course, King overcame in other ways as well. He remained strategically focused on gainingground -- his eyes on the prize constantly -- understanding that change would not be easy,understand that change wouldn't come overnight, understanding that there would be setbacksand false starts along the way, but understanding, as he said in 1956, that ""we can walk andnever get weary, because we know there is a great camp meeting in the promised land offreedom and justice."" And it's because the Moses generation overcame that the trials we face today are verydifferent from the ones that tested us in previous generations. Even after the worst recessionin generations, life in America is not even close to being as brutal as it was back then for somany. That's the legacy of Dr. King and his movement. That's our inheritance. Having saidthat, let there be no doubt the challenges of our new age are serious in their own right, andwe must face them as squarely as they faced the challenges they saw. I know it's been a hard road we've traveled this year to rescue the economy, but the economyis growing again. The job losses have finally slowed, and around the country, there's signsthat businesses and families are beginning to rebound. We are making progress. I know it's been a hard road that we've traveled to reach this point on health reform. Ipromise you I know. But under the legislation I will sign into law, insurance companies won'tbe able to drop you when you get sick, and more than 30 million people -- our fellowAmericans will finally have insurance. More than 30 million men and women and children,mothers and fathers, won't be worried about what might happen to them if they get sick. Thiswill be a victory not for Democrats; this will be a victory for dignity and decency, for ourcommon humanity. This will be a victory for the United States of America. Let's work to change the political system, as imperfect as it is. I know people can feel downabout the way things are going sometimes here in Washington. I know it's tempting to giveup on the political process. But we've put in place tougher rules on lobbying and ethics andtransparency -- tougher rules than any administration in history. It's not enough, but it'sprogress. Progress is possible. Don't give up on voting. Don't give up on advocacy. Don'tgive up on activism. There are too many needs to be met, too much work to be done. LikeDr. King said, ""We must accept finite disappointment but never lose infinite hope."" Let us broaden our coalition, building a confederation not of liberals or conservatives, not ofred states or blue states, but of all Americans who are hurting today, and searching for abetter tomorrow. The urgency of the hour demands that we make common cause with all ofAmerica's workers -- white, black, brown -- all of whom are being hammered by thisrecession, all of whom are yearning for that spring to come. It demands that we reach out tothose who've been left out in the cold even when the economy is good, even when we're notin recession -- the youth in the inner cities, the youth here in Washington, D.C., people inrural communities who haven't seen prosperity reach them for a very long time. It demandsthat we fight discrimination, whatever form it may come. That means we fight discrimination against gays and lesbians, and we make common cause to reform our immigration system. And finally, we have to recognize, as Dr. King did, that progress can't just come from without-- it also has to come from within. And over the past year, for example, we've mademeaningful improvements in the field of education. I've got a terrific Secretary of Education,Arne Duncan. He's been working hard with states and working hard with the D.C. schooldistrict, and we've insisted on reform, and we've insisted on accountability. We we're putting in more money and we've provided more Pell Grants and more tuition taxcredits and simpler financial aid forms. We've done all that, but parents still need to parent. Kids still need to own up to their responsibilities. We still have to set high expectations forour young people. Folks can't simply look to government for all the answers without alsolooking inside themselves, inside their own homes, for some of the answers. Progress will only come if we're willing to promote that ethic of hard work, a sense ofresponsibility, in our own lives. I'm not talking, by the way, just to the African Americancommunity. Sometimes when I say these things people assme, well, he's just talking to blackpeople about working hard. No, no, no, no. I'm talking to the American community. Becausesomewhere along the way, we, as a nation, began to lose touch with some of our core values. You know what I'm talking about. We became enraptured with the false prophets whoprophesized an easy path to success, paved with credit cards and home equity loans and get- rich-quick schemes, and the most important thing was to be a celebrity; it doesn   t matterwhat you do, as long as you get on TV. That's everybody. We forgot what made the bus boycott a success; what made the civil rights movement asuccess; what made the United States of America a success -- that, in this country, there's nosubstitute for hard work, no substitute for a job well done, no substitute for being responsiblestewards of God's blessings. What we're called to do, then, is rebuild America from its foundation on up. To reinvest in theessentials that we've neglected for too long -- like health care, like education, like a betterenergy policy, like basic infrastructure, like scientific research. Our generation is called tobuckle down and get back to basics. We must do so not only for ourselves, but also for our children, and their children. For Jordanand for Austin. That's a sacrifice that falls on us to make. It's a much smaller sacrifice thanthe Moses generation had to make, but it's still a sacrifice. Yes, it's hard to transition to a clean energy economy. Sometimes it may be inconvenient, butit's a sacrifice that we have to make. It's hard to be fiscally responsible when we have allthese human needs, and we're inheriting enormous deficits and debt, but that's a sacrificethat we're going to have to make. You know, it's easy, after a hard day's work, to just putyour kid in front of the TV set -- you're tired, don't want to fuss with them -- instead ofreading to them, but that's a sacrifice we must joyfully accept. Sometimes it's hard to be a good father and good mother. Sometimes it's hard to be a goodneighbor, or a good citizen, to give up time in service of others, to give something ofourselves to a cause that's greater than ourselves -- as Michelle and I are urging folks to dotomorrow to honor and celebrate Dr. King. But these are sacrifices that we are called tomake. These are sacrifices that our faith calls us to make. Our faith in the future. Our faithin America. Our faith in God. And on his sermon all those years ago, Dr. King quoted a poet's verse: Truth forever on the scaffoldWrong forever on the throne   And behind the dim unknown stands GodWithin the shadows keeping watch above his own. Even as Dr. King stood in this church, a victory in the past and uncertainty in the future, hetrusted God. He trusted that God would make a way. A way for prayers to be answered. Away for our union to be perfected. A way for the arc of the moral universe, no matter howlong, to slowly bend towards truth and bend towards freedom, to bend towards justice. Hehad faith that God would make a way out of no way. You know, folks ask me sometimes why I look so calm. They say, all this stuff coming at you,how come you just seem calm? And I have a confession to make here. There are timeswhere I'm not so calm. Reggie Love knows. My wife knows. There are times when progressseems too slow. There are times when the words that are spoken about me hurt. There aretimes when the barbs sting. There are times when it feels like all these efforts are for naught,and change is so painfully slow in coming, and I have to confront my own doubts. But let me tell you -- during those times it's faith that keeps me calm. It's faith that gives mepeace. The same faith that leads a single mother to work two jobs to put a roof over her headwhen she has doubts. The same faith that keeps an unemployed father to keep on submittingjob applications even after he's been rejected a hundred times. The same faith that says to ateacher even if the first nine children she's teaching she can't reach, that that 10th one she'sgoing to be able to reach. The same faith that breaks the silence of an earthquake's wakewith the sound of prayers and hymns sung by a Haitian community. A faith in things notseen, in better days ahead, in Him who holds the future in the hollow of His hand. A faith thatlets us mount up on wings like eagles; lets us run and not be weary; lets us walk and notfaint. So let us hold fast to that faith, as Joshua held fast to the faith of his fathers, and together,we shall overcome the challenges of a new age. Together, we shall seize the promise of thismoment. Together, we shall make a way through winter, and we're going to welcome thespring. Through God all things are possible. May the memory of Dr. Martin Luther King continue to inspire us and ennoble our world andall who inhabit it. And may God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you.",obama

Let  me  begin  by  saying  thanks  to  all  you  who've  traveled,  from  far  and  wide,  to  brave  the  cold   today.  I  know  it's  a  little  chilly        but  I'm  fired  up.   You  know,  we  all  made  this  journey  for  a  reason.  It's  humbling  to  see  a  crowd  like  this,  but  in   my  heart  I  know  you  didn't  just  come  here  for  me.  You  came  here  because  you  believe  in   what  this  country  can  be.  In  the  face  of  war,  you  believe  there  can  be  peace.  In  the  face  of   despair,  you  believe  there  can  be  hope.  In  the  face  of  a  politics  that  shut  you  out,  that's  told   you  to  settle,  that's  divided  us  for  too  long,  you  believe  that  we  can  be  one  people,  reaching   for  what's  possible,  building  that  more  perfect  union.   That's  the  journey  we're  on  today.  But  let  me  tell  you  how  I  came  to  be  here.  As  most  of  you   know,  I'm  not  a  native  of  this  great  state.  I  moved  to  Illinois  over  two  decades  ago.  I  was  a   young  man  then,  just  a  year  out  of  college.  I  knew  no  one  in  Chicago  when  I  arrived,  was   without  money  or  family  connections.  But  a  group  of  churches  had  offered  me  a  job  as  a   community  organizer  for  the  grand  sum  of  13,000  dollars  a  year.  And  I  accepted  the  job,  sight   unseen,  motivated  then  by  a  single,  simple,  powerful  idea:  that  I  might  play  a  small  part  in   building  a  better  America.   My  work  took  me  to  some  of  Chicago's  poorest  neighborhoods.  I  joined  with  pastors  and  lay     people  to  deal  with  communities  that  had  been  ravaged  by  plant  closings.

It  was  in  these  neighborhoods  that  I  received  the  best  education  that  I  ever  had,  and  where  I   learned  the  meaning  of  my  Christian  faith.   After  three  years  of  this  work,  I  went  to  law  school,  because  I  wanted  to  understand  how  the   law  should  work  for  those  in  need.  I  became  a  civil  rights  lawyer,  and  taught  constitutional   law,  and  after  a  time,  I  came  to  understand  that  our  cherished  rights  of  liberty  and  equality   depend  on  the  active  participation  of  an  awakened  electorate.  It  was  with  these  ideas  in  mind   that  I  arrived  in  this  capital  city  as  a  state  Senator.   It  was  here,  in  Springfield,  where  I  saw  all  that  is  America  converge        farmers  and  teachers,   businessmen  and  laborers,  all  of  them  with  a  story  to  tell,  all  of  them  seeking  a  seat  at  the   table,  all  of  them  clamoring  to  be  heard.  I  made  lasting  friendships  here,  friends  that  I  see   here  in  the  audience  today.  It  was  here  where  we  learned  to  disagree  without  being   disagreeable    that  it's  possible  to  compromise  so  long  as  you  know  those  principles  that  can   never  be  compromised    and  that  so  long  as  we're  willing  to  listen  to  each  other,  we  can   assume  the  best  in  people  instead  of  the  worst.   That's  why  we  were  able  to  reform  a  death  penalty  system  that  was  broken    that's  why  we   were  able  to  give  health  insurance  to  children  in  need    that's  why  we  made  the  tax  system   right  here  in  Springfield  more  fair  and  just  for  working  families    and  that's  why  we  passed   ethics  reform  that  the  cynics  said  could  never,  ever  be  passed.   It  was  here,  in  Springfield,  where  North,  South,  East,  and  West  come  together  that  I  was   reminded  of  the  essential  decency  of  the  American  people        where  I  came  to  believe  that   through  this  decency,  we  can  build  a  more  hopeful  America.  And  that  is  why,  in  the  shadow  of   the  Old  State  Capitol,  where  Lincoln  once  called  on  a  house  divided  to  stand  together,  where   common  hopes  and  common  dreams  still  live,  I  stand  before  you  today  to  announce  my   candidacy  for  President  of  the  United  States  of  America.   Look,  I  recognize  that  there  is  a  certain  presumptuousness  in  this,  a  certain  audacity,  to  this   announcement.  I  know  that  I  haven't  spent  a  lot  of  time  learning  the  ways  of  Washington.  But   I've  been  there  long  enough  to  know  that  the  ways  of  Washington  must  change.   The  genius  of  our  Founders  is  that  they  designed  a  system  of  government  that  can  be   changed.  And  we  should  take  heart,  because  we've  changed  this  country  before.  In  the  face  of   tyranny,  a  band  of  patriots  brought  an  empire  to  its  knees.  In  the  face  of  secession,  we   unified  a  nation  and  set  the  captives  free.  In  the  face  of  Depression,  we  put  people  back  to   work  and  lifted  millions  out  of  poverty.  We  welcomed  immigrants  to  our  shores.  We  opened   railroads  to  the  west.  We  landed  a  man  on  the  moon.  And  we  heard  a  King's  call  to  let  ""justice   roll  down  like  waters,  and  righteousness  like  a  mighty  stream."" Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Copyright  Status:  Restricted,  seek  permission.    2008   Page  2      We've  done  this  before.  Each  and  every  time,  a  new  generation  has  risen  up  and  done  what's   needed  to  be  done.  Today  we  are  called  once  more,  and  it  is  time  for  our  generation  to   answer  that  call.  For  that  is  our  unyielding  faith        that  in  the  face  of  impossible  odds,  people   who  love  their  country  can  change  it.   That's  what  Abraham  Lincoln  understood.  He  had  his  doubts.  He  had  his  defeats.  He  had  his   skeptics.  He  had  his  setbacks.  But  through  his  will  and  his  words,  he  moved  a  nation  and   helped  free  a  people.  It's  because  of  the  millions  who  rallied  to  his  cause  that  we're  no  longer   divided,  North  and  South,  slave  and  free.  It's  because  men  and  women  of  every  race,  from   every  walk  of  life,  continued  to  march  for  freedom  long  after  Lincoln  was  laid  to  rest,  that   today  we  have  the  chance  to  face  the  challenges  of  this  millennium  together,  as  one  people         as  Americans.   All  of  us  know  what  those  challenges  are  today:  a  war  with  no  end,  a  dependence  on  oil  that   threatens  our  future,  schools  where  too  many  children  aren't  learning,  and  families  struggling   paycheck  to  paycheck  despite  working  as  hard  as  they  can.  We  know  the  challenges.  We've   heard  them.  We've  talked  about  them  for  years.   What's  stopped  us  from  meeting  these  challenges  is  not  the  absence  of  sound  policies  and   sensible  plans.  What's  stopped  us  is  the  failure  of  leadership,  the  smallness  of  our  politics         the  ease  with  which  we're  distracted  by  the  petty  and  trivial,  our  chronic  avoidance  of  tough   decisions,  our  preference  for  scoring  cheap  political  points  instead  of  rolling  up  our  sleeves   and  building  a  working  consensus  to  tackle  the  big  problems  of  America.   For  the  past  six  years  we've  been  told  that  our  mounting  debts  don't  matter.  We've  been  told   that  the  anxiety  Americans  feel  about  rising  health  care  costs  and  stagnant  wages  are  an   illusion.  We've  been  told  that  climate  change  is  a  hoax.  We've  been  told  that  tough  talk  and   an  ill  conceived  war  can  replace  diplomacy,  and  strategy,  and  foresight.  And  when  all  else   fails,  when  Katrina  happens,  or  the  death  toll  in  Iraq  mounts,  we've  been  told  that  our  crises   are  somebody  else's  fault.  We're  distracted  from  our  real  failures,  and  told  to  blame  the  other   Party,  or  gay  people,  or  immigrants.   And  as  people  have  looked  away  in  disillusionment  and  frustration,  we  know  what's  filled  the   void:  the  cynics,  the  lobbyists,  the  special  interests        who've  turned  our  government  into  a   game  only  they  can  afford  to  play.  They  write  the  checks  and  you  get  stuck  with  the  bill.  They   get  the  access  while  you  get  to  write  a  letter.  They  think  they  own  this  government,  but  we're   here  today  to  take  it  back.  The  time  for  that  kind  of  politics  is  over.  It  is  through.  It's  time  to   turn  the  page        right  here,  and  right  now.   Look,  we  have  made  some  progress  already.  I  was  proud  to  help  lead  the  fight  in  Congress   that  led  to  the  most  sweeping  ethics  reforms  since  Watergate.  But  Washington  has  a  long  way   to  go,  and  it  won't  be  easy.  That's  why  we'll  have  to  set  priorities.  We'll  have  to  make  hard   choices.  And  although  government  will  play  a  crucial  role  in  bringing  about  the  changes  that   we  need,  more  money  and  programs  alone  will  not  get  us  to  where  we  need  to  go.  Each  of  us,   in  our  own  lives,  will  have  to  accept  responsibility        for  instilling  an  ethic  of  achievement  in   our  children,  for  adapting  to  a  more  competitive  economy,  for  strengthening  our  communities,   and  sharing  some  measure  of  sacrifice. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Copyright  Status:  Restricted,  seek  permission.    2008   Page  3      So  let  us  begin.  Let  us  begin  this  hard  work  together.  Let  us  transform  this  nation.  Let  us  be   the  generation  that  reshapes  our  economy  to  compete  in  the  digital  age.  Let's  set  high   standards  for  our  schools  and  give  them  the  resources  they  need  to  succeed.  Let's  recruit  a   new  army  of  teachers,  and  give  them  better  pay  and  more  support  in  exchange  for  more   accountability.  Let's  make  college  more  affordable,  and  let's  invest  in  scientific  research,  and   let's  lay  down  broadband  lines  through  the  heart  of  inner  cities  and  rural  towns  all  across   America.  We  can  do  that.   And  as  our  economy  changes,  let's  be  the  generation  that  ensures  our  nation's  workers  are   sharing  in  our  prosperity.  Let's  protect  the  hard  earned  benefits  their  companies  have   promised.  Let's  make  it  possible  for  hardworking  Americans  to  save  for  retirement.  Let's  allow   our  unions  and  their  organizers  to  lift  up  this  country's  middle  class  again.  We  can  do  that.   Let's  be  the  generation  that  ends  poverty  in  America.  Every  single  person  willing  to  work   should  be  able  to  get  job  training  that  leads  to  a  job,  and  earn  a  living  wage  that  can  pay  the   bills,  and  afford  child  care  so  their  kids  can  have  a  safe  place  to  go  when  they  work.  We  can   do  this.   And  let's  be  the  generation  that  finally,  after  all  these  years,  tackles  our  health  care  crisis.  We   can  control  costs  by  focusing  on  prevention,  by  providing  better  treatment  to  the  chronically   ill,  and  using  technology  to  cut  the  bureaucracy.  Let's  be  the  generation  that  says  right  here,   right  now:  We  will  have  universal  health  care  in  America  by  the  end  of  the  next  President's   first  term.  We  can  do  that.   Let's  be  the  generation  that  finally  frees  America  from  the  tyranny  of  oil.  We  can  harness   homegrown,  alternative  fuels  like  ethanol  and  spur  the  production  of  more  fuel  efficient  cars.   We  can  set  up  a  system  for  capping  greenhouse  gases.  We  can  turn  this  crisis  of  global   warming  into  a  moment  of  opportunity  for  innovation,  and  job  creation,  and  an  incentive  for   businesses  that  will  serve  as  a  model  for  the  world.  Let's  be  the  generation  that  makes  future   generations  proud  of  what  we  did  here.   Most  of  all,  let's  be  the  generation  that  never  forgets  what  happened  on  that  September  day   and  confront  the  terrorists  with  everything  we've  got.  Politics  doesn't  have  to  divide  us  on  this   anymore    we  can  work  together  to  keep  our  country  safe.  I've  worked  with  the  Republican   Senator  Dick  Lugar  to  pass  a  law  that  will  secure  and  destroy  some  of  the  world's  deadliest   weapons.  We  can  work  together  to  track  down  terrorists  with  a  stronger  military.  We  can   tighten  the  net  around  their  finances.  We  can  improve  our  intelligence  capabilities  and  finally   get  homeland  security  right.  But  let's  also  understand  that  ultimate  victory  against  our   enemies  will  only  come  by  rebuilding  our  alliances  and  exporting  those  ideals  that  bring  hope   and  opportunity  to  millions  of  people  around  the  globe.   We  can  do  those  things.   But  all  of  this  cannot  come  to  pass  until  we  bring  an  end  to  this  war  in  Iraq.  Most  of  you  know   that  I  opposed  this  war  from  the  start.  I  thought  it  was  a  tragic  mistake. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Copyright  Status:  Restricted,  seek  permission.    2008   Page  4      Today  we  grieve  for  the  families  who  have  lost  loved  ones,  the  hearts  that  have  been  broken,   and  the  young  lives  that  could  have  been.  America,  it  is  time  to  start  bringing  our  troops   home.  It's  time  to  admit  that  no  amount  of  American  lives  can  resolve  the  political   disagreement  that  lies  at  the  heart  of  someone  else's  civil  war.  That's  why  I  have  a  plan  that   will  bring  our  combat  troops  home  by  March  of  2008.  Letting  the  Iraqis  know  that  we  will  not   be  there  forever  is  our  last,  best  hope  to  pressure  the  Sunni  and  Shia  to  come  to  the  table   and  find  peace.   And  there's  one  other  thing  that  it's  not  too  late  to  get  right  about  this  war,  and  that  is  the   homecoming  of  the  men  and  women,  our  veterans,  who  have  sacrificed  the  most.  Let  us   honor  their  courage  by  providing  the  care  they  need  and  rebuilding  the  military  they  love.  Let   us  be  the  generation  that  begins  that  work.   I  know  there  are  those  who  don't  believe  we  can  do  all  these  things.  I  understand  the   skepticism.  After  all,  every  four  years,  candidates  from  both  Parties  make  similar  promises,   and  I  expect  this  year  will  be  no  different.  All  of  us  running  for  President  will  travel  around  the   country  offering  ten  point  plans  and  making  grand  speeches    all  of  us  will  trumpet  those   qualities  we  believe  make  us  uniquely  qualified  to  lead  this  country.  But  too  many  times,  after   the  election  is  over,  and  the  confetti  is  swept  away,  all  those  promises  fade  from  memory,  and   the  lobbyists  and  special  interests  move  in,  and  people  turn  away,  disappointed  as  before,  left   to  struggle  on  their  own.   That's  why  this  campaign  can't  only  be  about  me.  It  must  be  about  us.  It  must  be  about  what   we  can  do  together.  This  campaign  must  be  the  occasion,  the  vehicle,  of  your  hopes,  and  your   dreams.  It  will  take  your  time,  your  energy,  and  your  advice  to  push  us  forward  when  we're   doing  right,  and  let  us  know  when  we're  not.  This  campaign  has  to  be  about  reclaiming  the   meaning  of  citizenship,  restoring  our  sense  of  common  purpose,  and  realizing  that  few   obstacles  can  withstand  the  power  of  millions  of  voices  calling  for  change.   By  ourselves,  this  change  will  not  happen.  Divided,  we  are  bound  to  fail.  But  the  life  of  a  tall,   gangly,  self  made  Springfield  lawyer  tells  us  that  a  different  future  is  possible.   He  tells  us  that  there  is  power  in  words.   He  tells  us  that  there's  power  in  conviction.   That  beneath  all  the  differences  of  race  and  region,  faith  and  station,  we  are  one  people.   He  tells  us  that  there's  power  in  hope.   As  Lincoln  organized  the  forces  arrayed  against  slavery,  he  was  heard  to  say  this:  ""Of  strange,   discordant,  and  even  hostile  elements,  we  gathered  from  the  four  winds,  and  formed  and   fought  to  battle  through.""     That  is  our  purpose  here  today.  That  is  why  I  am  in  this  race        not  just  to  hold  an  office,  but   to  gather  with  you  to  transform  a  nation.  I  want  to  win  that  next  battle        for  justice  and   opportunity. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.   Copyright  Status:  Restricted,  seek  permission.    2008   Page  5      I  want  to  win  that  next  battle        for  better  schools,  and  better  jobs,  and  better  health  care  for   all.  I  want  us  to  take  up  the  unfinished  business  of  perfecting  our  union,  and  building  a  better   America.   And  if  you  will  join  with  me  in  this  improbable  quest,  if  you  feel  destiny  calling,  and  see  as  I   see,  the  future  of  endless  possibility  stretching  out  before  us    if  you  sense,  as  I  sense,  that   the  time  is  now  to  shake  off  our  slumber,  and  slough  off  our  fears,  and  make  good  on  the   debt  we  owe  past  and  future  generations,  then  I  am  ready  to  take  up  the  cause,  and  march   with  you,  and  work  with  you        today.   Together  we  can  finish  the  work  that  needs  to  be  done,  and  usher  in  a  new  birth  of  freedom   on  this  Earth.   Thank  you  very  much  everybody        let's  get  to  work!

"Good morning. And thank you to everyone who worked to bring us to this day, especially theInternational Auschwitz Council and the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum. To President Kacynski, Prime Minister Tusk, and to the people of Poland: Thank you forpreserving a place of such great pain for the Polish people, but a place of remembrance andlearning for the world. Although I can   t be with you in person, I am proud that the United States is represented theretoday by a delegation of distinguished Americans, including Ambassador Feinstein; my wifeMichelle   s chief of staff, Susan Sher; and my good friend, and the son of Holocaust survivors,Julius Genachowski. And let me commend you for recognizing a woman who has devoted her life to preserving thelessons of the shoah for future generations -- Sara Bloomfield of the United States HolocaustMemorial Museum in Washington. But most of all, I want to thank those of you who found the strength to come back again, somany years later, despite the horror you saw here, the suffering you endured here, and theloved ones you lost here. Those of us who did not live through those dark days will never trulyunderstand what it means to have hate literally etched into your arms. But we understand themessage that you carry in your hearts. For you know the truth that Elie Wiesel spoke when I stood with him at Buchenwald lastspring. There, where his father and so many innocent souls left this earth, Elie said:""...memory has become [a] sacred duty of all people of goodwill.    We have a sacred duty to remember the twisted thinking that led here -- how a great societyof culture and science succumbed to the worst instincts of man and rationalized mass murderand one of the most barbaric acts in history. We have a sacred duty to remember the cruelty that occurred here, as told in the simpleobjects that speak to us even now: the suitcases that still bear their names; the wooden clogsthey wore; the round bowls from which they ate; those brick buildings from which there wasno escape -- where so many Jews died with Sh   ma Israel on their lips; and the very earth atAuschwitz, which is still hallowed by their ashes -- Jews and those who tried to save them,Polish and Hungarian, French and Dutch, Roma and Russian, straight and gay, and so manyothers. But even as we recall man   s capacity for evil, Auschwitz also tells another story -- of man   scapacity for good: the small acts of compassion -- the sharing of some bread that kept a childalive; the great acts of resistance that blew up the crematorium and tried to stop theslaughter; the Polish Rescuers; and those who earned their place forever in the RighteousAmong the Nations. And you: the survivors. The perpetrators of that crime tried to annihilate the entire Jewish people. But they failed.Because 65 years ago today, when the gates flew open, you were still standing. And everyday that you have lived, every child and grandchild that your families have brought into theworld with love, every day the sun rises on the Jewish state of Israel -- that is the ultimaterebuke to the ignorance and hatred of this place. So to those of you who have come back today, I say, no, you are not    former prisoners.    Youare living memorials: living memorials to the loved ones you left here, and to the spirit wemust strive to uphold in our time -- not simply to bear witness, but to bear a burden -- theburden of seeing our common humanity; of resisting anti-Semitism and ignorance in all itsforms; of refusing to become bystanders to evil, whenever and wherever it rears its ugly face. Let that be the true meaning of Auschwitz. Let that be the liberation we celebrate today -- aliberation of the spirit that, if embraced, can lead us all -- individuals and as nations -- to beamong the righteous. May God bless you all, and may God bless the memory of all those who rest here.",obama
"Good  morning,  everybody.  This  morning,  I  sent  a  budget  to  Congress  for  the  coming  year.  It's   a  budget  that  reflects  the  serious  challenges  facing  the  country.  We're  at  war.  Our  economy   has  lost  7  million  jobs  over  the  last  two  years.  And  our  government  is  deeply  in  debt  after   what  can  only  be  described  as  a  decade  of  profligacy.   The  fact  is,  10  years  ago,  we  had  a  budget  surplus  of  more  than  $200  billion,  with  projected   surpluses  stretching  out  toward  the  horizon.  Yet  over  the  course  of  the  past  10  years,  the   previous  administration  and  previous  Congresses  created  an  expensive  new  drug  program,   passed  massive  tax  cuts  for  the  wealthy,  and  funded  two  wars  without  paying  for  any  of  it         all  of  which  was  compounded  by  recession  and  by  rising  health  care  costs.  As  a  result,  when  I   first  walked  through  the  door,  the  deficit  stood  at  $1.3  trillion,  with  projected  deficits  of  $8   trillion  over  the  next  decade.   If  we  had  taken  office  during  ordinary  times,  we  would  have  started  bringing  down  these   deficits  immediately.  But  one  year  ago,  our  country  was  in  crisis:  We  were  losing  nearly   700,000  jobs  each  month,  the  economy  was  in  a  free  fall,  and  the  financial  system  was  near   collapse.  Many  feared  another  Great  Depression.  So  we  initiated  a  rescue,  and  that  rescue   was  not  without  significant  cost    it  added  to  the  deficit  as  well.   One  year  later,  because  of  the  steps  we've  taken,  we're  in  a  very  different  place.  But  we  can't   simply  move  beyond  this  crisis    we  have  to  address  the  irresponsibility  that  led  to  it.  And  that   includes  the  failure  to  rein  in  spending,  as  well  a  reliance  on  borrowing        from  Wall  Street  to   Washington  to  Main  Street        to  fuel  our  growth. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.  Property  of     Copyright    2010.  All  rights  reserved.   Page  1      That's  what  we  have  to  change.  We  have  to  do  what  families  across  America  are  doing:  Save   where  we  can  so  that  we  can  afford  what  we  need.   Now,  I  think  it's  very  important  to  understand:  We  won't  be  able  to  bring  down  this  deficit   overnight,  given  that  the  recovery  is  still  taking  hold  and  families  across  the  country  still  need   help.  We  will  continue,  for  example,  to  do  what  it  takes  to  create  jobs.  That's  reflected  in  my   budget    it's  essential.  The  budget  includes  new  tax  cuts  for  people  who  invest  in  small   businesses,  tax  credits  for  small  businesses  that  hire  new  workers,  investments  that  will   create  jobs  repairing  roads  and  bridges,  and  tax  breaks  for  retrofitting  homes  to  save  energy.   We  also  continue  to  lay  a  new  foundation  for  lasting  growth,  which  is  essential  as  well.  Just  as   it  would  be  a  terrible  mistake  to  borrow  against  our  children's  future  to  pay  our  way  today,  it   would  be  equally  wrong  to  neglect  their  future  by  failing  to  invest  in  areas  that  will  determine   our  economic  success  in  this  new  century.   That's  why  we  build  on  the  largest  investment  in  clean  energy  in  history,  as  well  as  increase   investment  in  scientific  research,  so  that  we  are  fostering  the  industries  and  jobs  of  the  future   right  here  in  America.   That's  why  I've  proposed  a  more  than  6  percent  increase  in  funding  for  the  Education   Department.   And  this  funding  is  tied  to  reforms  that  raise  student  achievement,  inspire   students  to  excel  in  math  and  science,  and  turn  around  failing  schools  which  consign  too  many   young  people  to  a  lesser  future        because  in  the  21st  century  there  is  no  better  anti  poverty   program  than  a  world  class  education.   And  that's  why  we  eliminate  a  wasteful  subsidy  to  banks  that  lend  to  college  students,  and   use  that  money  to  revitalize  community  colleges  and  make  college  more  affordable.  This  will   help  us  reach  the  goal  I've  set  for  America:  By  2020  we  will  once  again  have  the  highest   proportion  of  college  graduates  in  the  world.   These  are  the  investments  we  must  make  to  create  jobs  and  opportunity  now  and  in  the   future.   And  in  a  departure  from  the  way  business  had  been  done  in  Washington,  we  actually   show  how  we  pay  for  these  investments  while  putting  our  country  on  a  more  fiscally   sustainable  path.   I've  proposed  a  freeze  in  government  spending  for  three  years.  This  won't  apply  to  the   benefits  folks  get  through  Social  Security,  Medicaid,  or  Medicare.  And  it  won't  apply  to  our   national  security        including  benefits  for  veterans.  But  it  will  apply  to  all  other  discretionary   government  programs.  And  we're  not  simply  photocopying  last  year's  budget    freezing   spending  does  not  mean  we  won't  cut  what  doesn't  work  to  pay  for  what  does. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.  Property  of     Copyright    2010.  All  rights  reserved.   Page  2      We  have  gone  through  every  department's  spending  line  by  line,  item  by  item,  looking  for   inefficiency,  duplication,  and  programs  that  have  outlived  their  usefulness.  That's  how  we   freeze  discretionary  spending.  Last  year,  we  found  $17  billion  in  cuts.  This  year,  we've  already   found  $20  billion.   Now,  some  of  these  cuts  are  just  common  sense.  For  example,  we  cut  $115  million  from  a   program  that  pays  states  to  clean  up  mines  that  have  already  been  cleaned  up.  We're  also   cutting  a  Forest  Service  economic  development  program  that  strayed  so  far  from  any  mission   that  it  funded  a  music  festival.  And  we're  saving  $20  million  by  stopping  the  refurbishment  of   a  Department  of  Energy  science  center  that  the  Department  of  Energy  does  not  want  to   refurbish.   Other  cuts,  though,  are  more  painful,  because  the  goals  of  the  underlying  programs  are   worthy.   We  eliminate  one  program  that  provides  grants  to  do  environmental  clean  up  of   abandoned  buildings.  That's  a  mission  I  support,  but  there  are  other  sources  of  private  and   public  funds  to  achieve  it.  We  also  eliminated  a  $120  million  program  that  allows  folks  to  get   their  Earned  Income  Tax  Credit  in  advance.  I  am  a  big  supporter  of  the  Earned  Income  Tax   Credit.  The  problem  is  80  percent  of  people  who  got  this  advance  didn't  comply  with  one  or   more  of  the  program's  requirements.   So  I'm  willing  to  reduce  waste  in  programs  I  care  about,  and  I'm  asking  members  of  Congress   to  do  the  same.   I'm  asking  Republicans  and  Democrats  alike  to  take  a  fresh  look  at  programs   they've  supported  in  the  past  to  see  what's  working  and  what's  not,  and  trim  back   accordingly.   Like  any  business,  we're  also  looking  for  ways  to  get  more  bang  for  our  buck,  by  promoting   innovation  and  cutting  red  tape.  For  example,  we  consolidate  38  separate  education  programs   into  11.  And  last  fall,  we  launched  the  ""SAVE  Awards""  to  solicit  ideas  from  federal  employees   about  how  make  government  more  efficient  and  more  effective.  I'm  proud  to  say  that  a   number  of  these  ideas        like  allowing  Social  Security  appointments  to  be  made  online         made  it  into  our  budget.   I  also  want  to  note  even  though  the  Department  of  Defense  is  exempt  from  the  budget  freeze,   it's  not  exempt  from  budget  common  sense.  It's  not  exempt  from  looking  for  savings.  We   save  money  by  eliminating  unnecessary  defense  programs  that  do  nothing  to  keep  us   safe.  One  example  is  the  $2.5  billion  that  we're  spending  to  build  C  17  transport  aircraft.  Four   years  ago,  the  Defense  Department  decided  to  cease  production  because  it  had  acquired  the   number  requested        180.  Yet  every  year  since,  Congress  had  provided  unrequested  money   for  more  C  17s  that  the  Pentagon  doesn't  want  or  need.  It's  waste,  pure  and  simple.   And  there  are  other  steps  we're  taking  to  rein  in  deficits.  I've  proposed  a  fee  on  big  banks  to   pay  back  taxpayers  for  the  bailout.  We're  reforming  the  way  contracts  are  awarded,  to  save   taxpayers  billions  of  dollars. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.  Property  of     Copyright    2010.  All  rights  reserved.   Page  3      And  while  we  extend  middle  class  tax  cuts  in  this  budget,  we  will  not  continue  costly  tax  cuts   for  oil  companies,  investment  fund  managers,  and  those  making  over  $250,000  a  year.  We   just  can't  afford  it.   Finally,  changing  spending  as  usual  depends  on  changing  politics  as  usual.  And  that's  why   I've  proposed  a  bipartisan  fiscal  commission:  a  panel  of  Democrats  and  Republicans  who   would  hammer  out  concrete  deficit  reduction  proposals  over  the  medium  and  long  term,  but   would  come  up  with  those  answers  by  a  certain  deadline.  I  should  point  out,  by  the  way,  that   is  an  idea  that  had  strong  bipartisan  support,  was  originally  introduced  by  Senators  Gregg  on   the  Republican  side  and  Conrad  on  the  Democratic  side    had  a  lot  of  Republican  cosponsors  to   the  idea.  I  hope  that,  despite  the  fact  that  it  got  voted  down  in  the  Senate,  that  both  the   Republican  Leader  Mitch  McConnell  and  the  Republican  Leader  in  the  House  John  Boehner  go   ahead  and  fully  embrace  what  has  been  a  bipartisan  idea  to  get  our  arms  around  this  budget.   That's  also  why  we're  restoring  pay  as  you  go:  a  simple  rule  that  says  Congress  can't  spend  a   dime  without  cutting  a  dime  elsewhere.  This  rule  helped  lead  to  the  budget  surpluses  of  the   1990s,  and  it's  one  of  the  most  important  steps  we  can  take  to  restore  fiscal  discipline  in   Washington.   You  can  read  more  about  the  budget  at  budget.gov        very  easy  to  remember         budget.gov.  But  the  bottom  line  is  this:  We  simply  cannot  continue  to  spend  as  if  deficits  don't   have  consequences    as  if  waste  doesn't  matter    as  if  the  hard  earned  tax  dollars  of  the   American  people  can  be  treated  like  Monopoly  money    as  if  we  can  ignore  this  challenge  for   another  generation.  We  can't.   In  order  to  meet  this  challenge,  I  welcome  any  idea,  from  Democrats  and  Republicans.  What  I   will  not  welcome        what  I  reject        is  the  same  old  grandstanding  when  the  cameras  are  on,   and  the  same  irresponsible  budget  policies  when  the  cameras  are  off.  It's  time  to  hold   Washington  to  the  same  standards  families  and  businesses  hold  themselves.  It's  time  to  save   what  we  can,  spend  what  we  must,  and  live  within  our  means  once  again.   Thanks  very  much. Transcription  by  Michael  E.  Eidenmuller.

"Thank you. Thank you very much. Please be seated. Thank you so much. Heads of state, Cabinet members, my outstanding Vice President,members of Congress, religious leaders, distinguished guests, Admiral Mullen -- it's good tosee all of you. Let me begin by acknowledging the co-chairs of this breakfast, SenatorsIsakson and Klobuchar, who embody the sense of fellowship at the heart of this gathering.They're two of my favorite senators. Let me also acknowledge the director of my faith-basedoffice, Joshua DuBois, who is here. Where's Joshua? He's out there somewhere. He's doinggreat work. I want to commend Secretary Hillary Clinton on her outstanding remarks, and her outstandingleadership at the State Department. She's doing good every day. I'm especially pleased to seemy dear friend, Prime Minister Zapatero, and I want him to relay America's greetings to thepeople of Spain. And Johnny, you are right, I'm deeply blessed, and I thank God every day forbeing married to Michelle Obama. I'm privileged to join you once again, as my predecessors have for over half a century. Likethem, I come here to speak about the ways my faith informs who I am -- as a President, andas a person. But I'm also here for the same reason that all of you are, for we all share arecognition -- one as old as time -- that a willingness to believe, an openness to grace, acommitment to prayer can bring sustenance to our lives. There is, of course, a need for prayer even in times of joy and peace and prosperity. Perhapsespecially in such times prayer is needed -- to guard against pride and to guard againstcomplacency. But rightly or wrongly, most of us are inclined to seek out the divine not in themoment when the Lord makes His face shine upon us, but in moments when God's grace canseem farthest away. Last month, God's grace, God's mercy, seemed far away from our neighbors in Haiti. And yet Ibelieve that grace was not absent in the midst of tragedy. It was heard in prayers and hymnsthat broke the silence of an earthquake's wake. It was witnessed among parishioners ofchurches that stood no more, a roadside congregation, holding bibles in their laps. It was feltin the presence of relief workers and medics; translators; servicemen and women, bringingwater and food and aid to the injured. One such translator was an American of Haitian descent, representative of the extraordinarywork that our men and women in uniform do all around the world -- Navy Corpsman Christian[sic] Brossard. And lying on a gurney aboard the USNS Comfort, a woman asked Christopher: ""Where do you come from? What country? After my operation,"" she said, ""I will pray for thatcountry."" And in Creole, Corpsman Brossard responded, ""Etazini."" The United States ofAmerica. God's grace, and the compassion and decency of the American people is expressed throughthe men and women like Corpsman Brossard. It's expressed through the efforts of our ArmedForces, through the efforts of our entire government, through similar efforts from Spain andother countries around the world. It's also, as Secretary Clinton said, expressed throughmultiple faith-based efforts. By evangelicals at World Relief. By the American Jewish WorldService. By Hindu temples, and mainline Protestants, Catholic Relief Services, AfricanAmerican churches, the United Sikhs. By Americans of every faith, and no faith, unitingaround a common purpose, a higher purpose. It's inspiring. This is what we do, as Americans, in times of trouble. We unite, recognizing thatsuch crises call on all of us to act, recognizing that there but for the grace of God go I,recognizing that life's most sacred responsibility -- one affirmed, as Hillary said, by all of theworld's great religions -- is to sacrifice something of ourselves for a person in need. Sadly, though, that spirit is too often absent when tackling the long-term, but no lessprofound issues facing our country and the world. Too often, that spirit is missing without thespectacular tragedy, the 9/11 or the Katrina, the earthquake or the tsunami, that can shakeus out of complacency. We become numb to the day-to-day crises, the slow-moving tragediesof children without food and men without shelter and families without health care. We becomeabsorbed with our abstract arguments, our ideological disputes, our contests for power. And inthis Tower of Babel, we lose the sound of God's voice. Now, for those of us here in Washington, let's acknowledge that democracy has always beenmessy. Let's not be overly nostalgic. Divisions are hardly new in this country. Argumentsabout the proper role of government, the relationship between liberty and equality, ourobligations to our fellow citizens -- these things have been with us since our founding. And I'mprofoundly mindful that a loyal opposition, a vigorous back and forth, a skepticism of power,all of that is what makes our democracy work. And we've seen actually some improvement in some circumstances. We haven't seen anycanings on the floor of the Senate any time recently. So we shouldn't over-romanticize thepast. But there is a sense that something is different now; that something is broken; thatthose of us in Washington are not serving the people as well as we should. At times, it seemslike we're unable to listen to one another; to have at once a serious and civil debate. And thiserosion of civility in the public square sows division and distrust among our citizens. It poisonsthe well of public opinion. It leaves each side little room to negotiate with the other. It makespolitics an all-or-nothing sport, where one side is either always right or always wrong when, inreality, neither side has a monopoly on truth. And then we lose sight of the children withoutfood and the men without shelter and the families without health care. Empowered by faith, consistently, prayerfully, we need to find our way back to civility. Thatbegins with stepping out of our comfort zones in an effort to bridge divisions. We see that inmany conservative pastors who are helping lead the way to fix our broken immigrationsystem. It's not what would be expected from them, and yet they recognize, in thoseimmigrant families, the face of God. We see that in the evangelical leaders who are rallyingtheir congregations to protect our planet. We see it in the increasing recognition amongprogressives that government can't solve all of our problems, and that talking about valueslike responsible fatherhood and healthy marriage are integral to any anti-poverty agenda.Stretching out of our dogmas, our prescribed roles along the political spectrum, that can helpus regain a sense of civility. Civility also requires relearning how to disagree without being disagreeable; understanding, asPresident [Kennedy] said, that ""civility is not a sign of weakness."" Now, I am the first toconfess I am not always right. Michelle will testify to that. But surely you can question mypolicies without questioning my faith, or, for that matter, my citizenship. Challenging each other's ideas can renew our democracy. But when we challenge each other'smotives, it becomes harder to see what we hold in common. We forget that we share at somedeep level the same dreams -- even when we don't share the same plans on how to fulfillthem. We may disagree about the best way to reform our health care system, but surely we canagree that no one ought to go broke when they get sick in the richest nation on Earth. We cantake different approaches to ending inequality, but surely we can agree on the need to lift ourchildren out of ignorance; to lift our neighbors from poverty. We may disagree about gay marriage, but surely we can agree that it is unconscionable totarget gays and lesbians for who they are -- whether it's here in the United States or, asHillary mentioned, more extremely in odious laws that are being proposed most recently inUganda. Surely we can agree to find common ground when possible, parting ways when necessary. Butin doing so, let us be guided by our faith, and by prayer. For while prayer can buck us upwhen we are down, keep us calm in a storm; while prayer can stiffen our spines to surmountan obstacle -- and I assure you I'm praying a lot these days -- prayer can also do somethingelse. It can touch our hearts with humility. It can fill us with a spirit of brotherhood. It canremind us that each of us are children of a awesome and loving God. Through faith, but not through faith alone, we can unite people to serve the commongood. And that's why my Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships has beenworking so hard since I announced it here last year. We've slashed red tape and built effectivepartnerships on a range of uses, from promoting fatherhood here at home to spearheadinginterfaith cooperation abroad. And through that office we've turned the faith-based initiativearound to find common ground among people of all beliefs, allowing them to make an impactin a way that's civil and respectful of difference and focused on what matters most. It is this spirit of civility that we are called to take up when we leave here today. That's whatI'm praying for. I know in difficult times like these -- when people are frustrated, whenpundits start shouting and politicians start calling each other names -- it can seem like areturn to civility is not possible, like the very idea is a relic of some bygone era. The worditself seems quaint -- civility. But let us remember those who came before; those who believed in the brotherhood of maneven when such a faith was tested. Remember Dr. Martin Luther King. Not long after anexplosion ripped through his front porch, his wife and infant daughter inside, he rose to thatpulpit in Montgomery and said, ""Love is the only force capable of transforming an enemy intoa friend."" In the eyes of those who denied his humanity, he saw the face of God. Remember Abraham Lincoln. On the eve of the Civil War, with states seceding and forcesgathering, with a nation divided half slave and half free, he rose to deliver his first Inauguraland said, ""We are not enemies, but friends   Though passion may have strained, it must notbreak our bonds of affection."" Even in the eyes of confederate soldiers, he saw the face of God. Remember William Wilberforce, whose Christian faith led him to seek slavery's abolition inBritain; he was vilified, derided, attacked; but he called for ""lessening prejudices [and]conciliating good-will, and thereby making way for the less obstructed progress of truth."" In the eyes of those who sought to silence a nation's conscience, he saw the face of God. Yes, there are crimes of conscience that call us to action. Yes, there are causes that move ourhearts and offenses that stir our souls. But progress doesn't come when we demonizeopponents. It's not born in righteous spite. Progress comes when we open our hearts, whenwe extend our hands, when we recognize our common humanity. Progress comes when welook into the eyes of another and see the face of God. That we might do so -- that we will doso all the time, not just some of the time -- is my fervent prayer for our nation and the world. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.",obama
"Hello, everybody. I am glad to see that all of you braved the weather to be here. A little while ago I had ameeting with the Democratic and Republican congressional leaders, and it went very well. In fact, Iunderstand that McConnell and Reid are out doing snow angels on the South Lawn together. Can youpicture that, Chuck? Not really? The meeting did go well, and I appreciate them making the trek. We had a good and frank conversation andit's one that I hope we can continue on a more regular basis. We all understand that there are legitimate and genuine differences between the parties, but despite thepolitical posturing that often paralyzes this town, there are many issues upon which we can and shouldagree. That's what the American people are demanding of us. I think they're tired of every day beingElection Day in Washington. And at this critical time in our country, the people sent us here expect aseriousness of purpose that transcends petty politics. That's why I'm going to continue to seek the best ideas from either party as we work to tackle the pressingchallenges ahead. I am confident, for example, that when one in 10 of our fellow citizens can't work, weshould be able to come together and help business create more jobs. We ought to be able to agree onproviding small businesses with additional tax credits and much needed lines of credit. We ought to agreeon investments in crumbling roads and bridges, and we should agree on tax breaks for making homes moreenergy-efficient -- all of which will put more Americans to work. Many of the job proposals that I've laid out have passed the House and are soon going to be debated in theSenate. We spent a lot of time in this meeting discussing a jobs package and how we could move forwardon that. And if there are additional ideas, I will consider them as well. What I won't consider is doingnothing in the face of a lot of hardship across the country. We also talked about restoring fiscal responsibility. There are few matters on which there is as muchvigorous bipartisan agreement, at least in public, but unfortunately there's also a lot of partisan wranglingbehind closed doors. This is what we know for sure: For us to solve this extraordinary problem that is somany years in the making, it's going to take the cooperation of both parties. It's not going to happen in anyother way. I'm pleased that Congress supported my request to restore the pay-as-you-go rule, which was instrumentalin turning deficits into surpluses during the 1990s. I've also called for a bipartisan fiscal commission. Unfortunately this measure, which originally had received the support of a bipartisan majority of the Senateand was cosponsored by Senators Conrad and Gregg, Democrats and Republicans, was blocked there. SoI'm going to be creating this commission by executive order. And during our meeting I asked the leadershipof both parties to join in this serious effort to address our long-term deficits, because when the politics is putaside, the reality of our fiscal challenge is not subject to interpretation. Math is not partisan. There ought tobe a debate about how to close our deficits. What we can't accept is business as usual, and we can't affordgrandstanding at the expense of actually getting something done. During our meeting we also touched briefly on how we can move forward on health reform. I've alreadyannounced that in two weeks I'll be holding a meeting with people from both parties, and as I told thecongressional leadership, I'm looking forward to a constructive debate with plans that need to be measuredagainst this test. Does it bring down costs for all Americans as well as for the federal government, whichspends a huge amount on health care? Does it provide adequate protection against abuses by theinsurance industry? Does it make coverage affordable and available to the tens of millions of workingAmericans who don't have it right now? And does it help us get on a path of fiscal sustainability? We also talked about why this is so urgent. Just this week, there was a report that Anthem Blue Cross,which is the largest insurer in the largest state, California, is planning on raising premiums for manyindividual policyholders by as much as 39 percent. If we don't act, this is just a preview of comingattractions. Premiums will continue to rise for folks with insurance; millions more will lose their coveragealtogether; our deficits will continue to grow larger. And we have an obligation -- both parties -- to tackle thisissue in a serious way. Now, bipartisanship depends on a willingness among both Democrats and Republicans to put aside mattersof party for the good of the country. I won't hesitate to embrace a good idea from my friends in the minorityparty, but I also won't hesitate to condemn what I consider to be obstinacy that's rooted not in substantivedisagreements but in political expedience. We talked about this as well, particularly when it comes to theconfirmation process. I respect the Senate's role to advise and consent, but for months, qualified, non-controversial nominees for critical positions in government, often positions related to our national security,have been held up despite having overwhelming support. My nominee for one important job, the head ofGeneral Services Administration, which helps run the government, was denied a vote for nine months. When she finally got a vote on her nomination, she was confirmed 96 to nothing. That's not advise andconsent; that's delay and obstruct. One senator, as you all are aware, had put a hold on every single nominee that we had put forward due to adispute over a couple of earmarks in his state. In our meeting, I asked the congressional leadership to put astop to these holds in which nominees for critical jobs are denied a vote for months. Surely we can setaside partisanship and do what's traditionally been done to confirm these nominations. If the Senate doesnot act -- and I made this very clear -- if the Senate does not act to confirm these nominees, I will considermaking several recess appointments during the upcoming recess, because we can't afford to allow politicsto stand in the way of a well-functioning government. My hope is that this will be the first of a series of meetings that I have with leadership of both parties inCongress. We've got to get past the tired debates that have plagued our politics and left behind nothing butsoaring debt and mounting challenges, greater hardships among the American people, and extraordinaryfrustrations among the American people. Those frustrations are what led me to run for President, and aslong as I'm here in Washington, I intend to try to make this government work on their behalf. So, you know, I'm going to take a couple of questions, guys. Major. Question: After meeting with you, John Boehner came out and told us, ""The House can't pass the healthcare bill it once passed; the Senate can't pass the health care bill it once passed. Why would we have aconversation about legislation that can't pass?"" As a part of that, he said you and your White House andcongressional Democrats should start over entirely from scratch on health care reform. How do yourespond? Are you willing to do that? President Obama: Well, here's how I responded to John in the meeting, and I've said this publicly before. There are some core goals that have to be met. We've got to control costs, both for families andbusinesses, but also for our government. Everybody out there who talks about deficits has to acknowledgethat the single biggest driver of our deficits is health care spending. We cannot deal with our deficits anddebt long term unless we get a handle on that. So that has to be part of a package. Number two, we've got to deal with insurance abuses that affect millions of Americans who've got healthinsurance. And number three, we've got to make health insurance more available to folks in the individualmarket, as I just mentioned, in California, who are suddenly seeing their premiums go up 39 percent. Thatapplies to the majority of small businesses, as well as sole proprietors. They are struggling. So I've got these goals. Now, we have a package, as we work through the differences between the Houseand the Senate, and we'll put it up on a Web site for all to see over a long period of time, that meets thosecriteria, meets those goals. But when I was in Baltimore talking to the House Republicans, they indicated,we can accomplish some of these goals at no cost. And I said, great, let me see it. And I have no interestin doing something that's more expensive and harder to accomplish if somebody else has an easier way todo it. So I'm going to be starting from scratch in the sense that I will be open to any ideas that help promote thesegoals. What I will not do, what I don't think makes sense and I don't think the American people want to see, wouldbe another year of partisan wrangling around these issues; another six months or eight months or ninemonths worth of hearings in every single committee in the House and the Senate in which there's a lot ofposturing. Let's get the relevant parties together; let's put the best ideas on the table. My hope is that wecan find enough overlap that we can say this is the right way to move forward, even if I don't get everysingle thing that I want. But here's the point that I made to John Boehner and Mitch McConnell: Bipartisanship can't be that I agreeto all the things that they believe in or want, and they agree to none of the things I believe in and want, andthat's the price of bipartisanship, right? But that's sometimes the way it gets presented. Mitch McConnellsaid something very nice in the meeting about how he supports our goals on nuclear energy and clean coaltechnology and more drilling to increase oil production. Well, of course he likes that; that's part of theRepublican agenda for energy, which I accept. And I'm willing to move off some of the preferences of myparty in order to meet them halfway. But there's got to be some give from their side as well. That's true onhealth care; that's true on energy; that's true on financial reform. That's what I'm hoping gets accomplishedat the summit. Question: Do you agree the House and Senate bill can't pass anymore? President Obama: What I agree with is that the public has soured on the process that they saw over thelast year. I think that actually contaminates how they view the substance of the bills. I think it is importantfor all of these issues to be aired so that people have confidence if we're moving forward on such asignificant part of the economy as health care, that there is complete transparency and all of these issueshave been adequately vetted and adequately debated. And this gives an opportunity not just for Democrats to say here's what we think we should do, but it alsogives Republicans a showcase before the entire country to say here's our plan; here's why we think this willwork. And one of the things that John Boehner and Mitch McConnell both said is they didn't think that thestatus quo was acceptable, and that's, right there, promising. That indicates that if all sides agree that wecan't just continue with business as usual then maybe we can actually get something done. Question: Mr. President, one of the reasons Anthem said -- Anthem Blue Cross says that it's raising itspremiums is because so many people are dropping out of individual coverage because the economy is sobad and that leaves the people in the pool who are people who need medical care driving up costs. One ofthe reasons why businesses are not expanding right now, in addition to some of the credit issues you'vetalked about, at least according to business leaders, is they say there's an uncertainty of what they need toplan for because of the energy bill, because of health care. That's what they say. I'm not saying it's true ornot, but that's what they say. What do you say when you hear that? President Obama: Well, I think that the biggest uncertainty has been we just went through the worstrecession since the Great Depression and people weren't sure whether the financial system was going tomelt down and whether we were going to tip into a endless recession. So let's be clear about the sources ofuncertainty in terms of business investment over the last several years: A huge contraction, trillions ofdollars of losses in people's 401(k)s; people have a lot of debt coming out of the previous decade that theystill haven't worked out; the housing market losing a whole bunch of value. So the good news is that where we were contracting by 6 percent the economy is now growing by 6percent. The CEOs I talked to are saying they are now making investments, and I anticipate that they'regoing to start hiring at a more rapid clip. What I've also heard is them saying that we would like to feel likeWashington is working and able to get some things done. There are two ways of interpreting the issue of uncertainty. One way would be to say, well, you know what,we'll just go back to what we were doing before on, let's say, the financial markets. We won't have theregulations that we need; we won't make any changes in terms of ""too big to fail."" That will provide certainty-- until the next financial crisis. That's not the kind of certainty I think that the financial markets need. The kind of certainty they need is forus to go ahead and agree on a bipartisan effort to put some rules of the road in place so that consumers areprotected in the financial markets; so that we don't have banks that are too big to fail; that we have ways ofwinding them down and protecting the overall system without taxpayer bailouts. That requires legislation. The sooner we can get that done, the better. The same would be true when it comes to health care. A lot of CEOs I hear from will say, boy, we'd like youto get health care settled one way or another, but they will acknowledge that when they open up their latestinvoice for their premiums and they find out that those premiums have gone up 20 percent or 25 percent,that's the kind of uncertainty that also tamps down business investment. So I guess my answer would be this: The sooner the business community has a sense that we've got ouract together here in Washington and can move forward on big, serious issues in a substantive way without alot of posturing and partisan wrangling, I think the better off the entire country is going to be. I absolutelyagree on that. What I think is important is not to buy into this notion that is perpetrated by some of the business intereststhat got a stake in this who are fighting financial reform, for example, to say, boy, we'd be doing fine if wejust didn't try to regulate the banks. That I think would be a mistake. Question: Just to play devil's advocate on that -- a small business, let's say, not somebody who's going tobe affected by the regulatory reform, small business -- you have proposed, you would acknowledge, a boldagenda. And a small business might wonder, I don't know how the energy bill is going to affect me, I don'tknow how the health care reform bill is going to affect me -- I'd better hold off on hiring. President Obama: The small businesses I talk to -- and I've been talking to a lot of them as I've beentraveling around the country over the last several months -- their biggest problem is right now they can't getcredit out of their banks so they're uncertain about that. And they're still uncertain about orders -- do theyjust have enough customers to justify them doing more. It's looking better at this point. But that's not the rationale for people saying, I'm not hiring. Let me put it thisway. Most small businesses right now, if they've got enough customers to make a profit and they can getthe bank loans required to boost their payroll, boost their inventory, and sell to those customers, they will doso. Okay? Let's see, let's get a print guy here. David. Question: You heard McConnell talk about nuclear power, offshore drilling, free trade -- that's a lot ofRepublican stuff. Is your party going to go for that if you decide to support that -- President Obama: You know, I think that on energy there should be a bipartisan agreement that we haveto take a both/and approach rather than an either/or approach. What do I mean by that? I am very firm inmy conviction that the country that leads the way in clean energy -- solar, wind, biodiesel, geothermal -- thatcountry is going to win the race in the 21st century global economy. So we have to move in that direction. What is also true is that given our energy needs in order to continue economic growth, produce jobs, makesure our businesses are competitive around the world, that we're going to need some of the old, traditionalenergy sources as we're developing these new ones and ramping them up. So we can't overnight convertto an all-solar or an all-wind economy. That just can't happen. We're going to have needs in thesetraditional sources. And so the question then is, are we going to be able to put together a package that includes safe, securenuclear power; that includes new technologies so that we can use coal -- which we have in abundance andis very cheap, but often is adding to our greenhouse gases -- can we find sequestration technologies thatclean that up; can we identify opportunities to increase our oil and natural gas production in a way that isenvironmentally sustainable? And that should be part of a package with our development of clean energy. And my hope is that my Republican friends, but also Democrats, say to themselves, let's be practical andlet's do both. Let's not just do one or the other; let's do both. Over time I think the transition is going to bemore and more clean energy and over time fossil fuels become less prominent in our overall energy mix. But we've got to do both. Question: How confident are you there will be that kind of consensus for that double-edged approach? President Obama: I am just a eternal optimist -- and so -- it's the right thing to do. And all I can do is justto keep on making the argument about what's right for the country and assume that over time people,regardless of party, regardless of their particular political positions, are going to gravitate towards the truth. Okay? I'm going to take two more. Let's see -- Question: How about the back? President Obama: Well, I just want to make sure that I was getting a balance here, so -- go ahead, Chuck. Question: Awwww -- President Obama: Why is everybody moaning about Todd? Question: He's too good. His questions are too precise. Question: Iran -- we got the news today that they're doing more of these -- trying to enhance this uraniumeven more. Obviously Secretary Gates today in Paris was quoted as saying basically the dialogue seems tobe over and now the question is sanctions. Where are we on sanctions? How close is this? I know youhad sort of an end-of-the-year deadline when you stood up there with Sarkozy and Brown. It's nowFebruary. How quickly is this moving along? President Obama: Well, it's moving along fairly quickly. I think that we have bent over backwards to say tothe Islamic Republic of Iran that we are willing to have a constructive conversation about how they can alignthemselves with international norms and rules and reenter as full members of the international community. The most obvious attempt was when we gave them an offer that said we are going to provide theconversion of some of the low-enriched uranium that they already have into the isotopes that they need fortheir medical research and for hospitals that would serve up to a million Iranian citizens. They rejected it --although one of the difficulties in dealing with Iran over the last several months is it's not always clear who'sspeaking on behalf of the government, and we get a lot of different, mixed signals. But what's clear is, isthat they have not said yes to an agreement that Russia, China, Germany, France, Great Britain and theUnited States all said was a good deal, and that the director of the IAEA said was the right thing to do andthat Iran should accept. That indicates to us that, despite their posturing that their nuclear power is only for civilian use, that they infact continue to pursue a course that would lead to weaponization. And that is not acceptable to theinternational community, not just to the United States. So what we've said from the start was we're movingon dual tracks. If you want to accept the kinds of agreements with the international community that lead youdown a path of being a member of good standing, then we welcome you. If not -- Question: Haven't they responded, though? I mean, by deciding to do what they did, with these -- President Obama: Well, I'm getting to that. Question: Okay. President Obama: And if not, then the next step is sanctions. They have made their choice so far,although the door is still open. And what we are going to be working on over the next several weeks isdeveloping a significant regime of sanctions that will indicate to them how isolated they are from theinternational community as a whole. Question: What do you mean by    regime of sanctions   ? President Obama: Well, meaning that there's going to be a -- Question: Some will be U.N. and some will be -- President Obama: We are going to be looking at a variety of ways in which countries indicate to Iran thattheir approach is unacceptable. And the U.N. will be one aspect of that broader effort. Question: China will be there? You're confident? President Obama: Well, the -- we are confident right now that the international community is unifiedaround Iran's misbehavior in this area. How China operates at the Security Council as we pursue sanctionsis something that we're going to have to see. One thing I'm pleased about is to see how forward-leaning theRussians have been on this issue. I think they clearly have seen that Iran hasn't been serious about solvingwhat is a solvable dispute between Iran and the international community. All right? I'm going to make this the last question. And I'll take somebody from the back -- yes. Question: Me? President Obama: Yes. Question: Thanks for doing this. It's been a while. On health care, the Republicans are asking whetherthe February 25th session will include economists and public interest groups and people supporting yourside, or will it just be the members of Congress? And on Anthem Blue Cross, do you have the authority togo in and tell a private company they can't charge that -- how will you stop them? President Obama: Well, I don't have the authority as I understand it -- I can't simply issue an executiveorder lowering everybody's rates. If I could I would have done that already and saved myself a lot of griefon Capitol Hill. That's why reform is so important. That's why the status quo is unacceptable. But there is no shortcut in dealing with this issue. I know the American people get frustrated in debatingsomething like health care because you get a whole bunch of different claims being made by differentgroups and different interests. It is a big, complicated, tough issue. But what is also true is that withoutsome action on the part of Congress, it is very unlikely that we see any improvement over the currenttrajectory. And the current trajectory is premiums keep on going up 10, 15, 20, 30 percent. The currenttrajectory is more and more people are losing health care. I don't know if people noted, because during the health care debate everybody was saying the President istrying to take over -- a government takeover of health care. I don't know if anybody noticed that for the firsttime this year you saw more people getting health care from government than you did from the privatesector -- not because of anything we did, but because more and more people are losing their health carefrom their employers. It's becoming unaffordable. That's what we're trying to prevent. We want people to be able to get health care from their employers. But we also understand that you've gotto fix the system so that people are able to get it at affordable rates and small businesses can afford to givetheir employees insurance at an affordable rate. And that's not happening right now. To your question about the 25th, my hope is that this doesn't end up being political theater, as I think someof you have phrased it. I want a substantive discussion. We haven't refined exactly how the agenda isgoing to go that day. We want to talk with both the Democratic and Republican leaders to find out what theythink would be most useful. I do want to make sure that there's some people like the Congressional BudgetOffice, for example, that are considered non-partisan, who can answer questions. In this whole health care debate I'm reminded of the story that was told about Senator Moynihan, who was Iguess in an argument with one of his colleagues, and his colleague was losing the argument so he got alittle flustered and said to Senator Moynihan, ""Well, I'm entitled to my own opinion."" And Senator Moynihansaid, ""Well, you're entitled to your own opinion, but you're not entitled to your own facts."" I think that's thekey to a successful dialogue on the 25th or on health care. Let's establish some common facts. Let's establish what the issues are, what the problems are, and let'stest out in front of the American people what ideas work and what ideas don't. And if we can establish thatfactual accuracy about how different approaches would work, then I think we can make some progress. And it may be that some of the facts that come up are ones that make my party a little bit uncomfortable. Soif it's established that by working seriously on medical malpractice and tort reform that we can reduce someof those costs, I've said from the beginning of this debate I'd be willing to work on that. On the other hand, ifI'm told that that is only a fraction of the problem and that is not the biggest driver of health care costs, thenI'm also going to insist, okay, let's look at that as one aspect of it, but what else are we willing to do? And this is where it gets back to the point I was making earlier. Bipartisanship cannot mean simply thatDemocrats give up everything that they believe in, find the handful of things that Republicans have beenadvocating for and we do those things, and then we have bipartisanship. That's not how it works in anyother realm of life. That's certainly not how it works in my marriage with Michelle, although I usually do givein most of the time. But the -- there's got to be some give and take, and that's what I'm hoping can beaccomplished. And I'm confident that's what the American people are looking for. So, all right? Question: Jobs question? President Obama: Okay, since there wasn't a jobs question -- Question: Well, I just -- President Obama: I'll make this the last one, jobs question. Question: At the stakeout, the Republicans were saying, well, the jobs package we've seen, it's not reallyready yet, we're a little worried about the cost. Are you satisfied that there is something that can be quicklymoved through Congress on jobs? President Obama: Well, my understanding is -- first of all, the House has moved forward a jobs packagethat has some good elements in it. My understanding is, is that there is bipartisan talks taking place as wespeak on the Senate side about some elements of a package. I think there are some things that a lot of people agree on. Just to give you an example, the idea ofeliminating capital gains for small businesses -- something we can all agree on. I talked about it at the Stateof the Union address. My hope would be that we would all agree on a mechanism to get community bankswho are lending to small businesses more capital, because that is something that I keep on hearing is oneof the biggest problems that small businesses have out there. So I think that it's realistic for us to get a package moving quickly that may not include all the things I thinkneed to be done, and it may be that that first package builds some trust and confidence that Democrats andRepublicans on Capitol Hill can work together and then we move on to the next aspect of the package andso forth. It may take a series of incremental steps, but the one thing I'm absolutely clear about is, is thatwe've got an economy that's growing right now, a huge boost in productivity -- that's the good news. Thebad news is, is that companies still haven't taken that final step in actually putting people on their payroll full- time. We're seeing an increase in temporary workers, but they haven't yet taken on that full-time worker. And soproviding some additional impetus to them, right as the economy is moving in a positive direction, I think canend up yielding some good results. All right? Thank you, guys. That was pretty good, thanks.",obama
"Thank you so much, all of you, for joining us today. And I want to thank Julie, Barbara, Roland, Stephen,Renee, and Christopher, standing behind me -- physicians, physicians assistants, and nurses whounderstand how important it is for us to make much needed changes in our health care system. I want to thank all of you who are here today. I want to specially recognize two people who have beenworking tirelessly on that -- on this effort, my Secretary of Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius --as well as our quarterback for health reform out of the White House, Nancy-Ann DeParle. We began our push to reform health insurance last March, in this room, with doctors and nurses who knowthe system best. And so it   s fitting to be joined by all of you as we bring this journey to a close. Last Thursday, I spent seven hours at a summit where Democrats and Republicans engaged in a public andvery substantive discussion about health care. This meeting capped off a debate that began with a similarsummit nearly one year ago. And since then, every idea has been put on the table. Every argument hasbeen made. Everything there is to say about health care has been said -- and just about everybody hassaid it. So now is the time to make a decision about how to finally reform health care so that it works, notjust for the insurance companies, but for America   s families and America   s businesses. Now, where both sides say they agree is that the status quo is not working for the American people. Healthinsurance is becoming more expensive by the day. Families can   t afford it. Businesses can   t afford it. Thefederal government can   t afford it. Smaller businesses and individuals who don   t get coverage at work aresqueezed especially hard. And insurance companies freely ration health care based on who   s sick andwho   s healthy; who can pay and who can   t. That's the status quo. That's the system we have right now. Democrats and Republicans agree that this is a serious problem for America. And we agree that if we donothing -- if we throw up our hands and walk away -- it   s a problem that will only grow worse. Nobodydisputes that. More Americans will lose their family's health insurance if they switch jobs or lose their job. More small businesses will be forced to choose between health care and hiring. More insurance companieswill deny people coverage who have preexisting conditions, or they'll drop people's coverage when they getsick and need it most. And the rising cost of Medicare and Medicaid will sink our government deeper anddeeper and deeper into debt. On all of this we agree. So the question is, what do we do about it? On one end of the spectrum, there are some who've suggested scrapping our system of private insuranceand replacing it with a government-run health care system. And though many other countries have such asystem, in America it would be neither practical nor realistic. On the other end of the spectrum, there are those, and this includes most Republicans in Congress, whobelieve the answer is to loosen regulations on the insurance industry -- whether it's state consumerprotections or minimum standards for the kind of insurance they can sell. The argument is, is that that willsomehow lower costs. I disagree with that approach. I'm concerned that this would only give the insuranceindustry even freer rein to raise premiums and deny care. So I don't believe we should give government bureaucrats or insurance company bureaucrats more controlover health care in America. I believe it's time to give the American people more control over their healthcare and their health insurance. I don't believe we can afford to leave life-and-death decisions about healthcare to the discretion of insurance company executives alone. I believe that doctors and nurses andphysician assistants like the ones in this room should be free to decide what's best for their patients. Now, the proposal I put forward gives Americans more control over their health insurance and their healthcare by holding insurance companies more accountable. It builds on the current system where mostAmericans get their health insurance from their employer. If you like your plan, you can keep your plan. Ifyou like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. I can tell you as the father of two young girls, I would notwant any plan that interferes with the relationship between a family and their doctor. Essentially, my proposal would change three things about the current health care system. First, it wouldend the worst practices of insurance companies. No longer would they be able to deny your coveragebecause of a preexisting condition. No longer would they be able to drop your coverage because you gotsick. No longer would they be able to force you to pay unlimited amounts of money out of your own pocket. No longer would they be able to arbitrarily and massively raise premiums like Anthem Blue Cross recentlytried to do in California -- up to 39 percent increases in one year in the individual market. Those practiceswould end. Second, my proposal would give uninsured individuals and small business owners the same kind of choiceof private health insurance that members of Congress get for themselves -- because if it   s good enough formembers of Congress, it   s good enough for the people who pay their salaries. The reason federal employees get a good deal on health insurance is that we all participate in an insurancemarket where insurance companies give better coverage and better rates, because they get morecustomers. It's an idea that many Republicans have embraced in the past, before politics intruded. And my proposal says that if you still can   t afford the insurance in this new marketplace, even though it'sgoing to provide better deals for people than they can get right now in the individual marketplace, then we'lloffer you tax credits to do so -- tax credits that add up to the largest middle-class tax cut for health care inhistory. After all, the wealthiest among us can already buy the best insurance there is, and the least well offare able to get coverage through Medicaid. So it's the middle class that gets squeezed, and that   s who wehave to help. Now, it is absolutely true that all of this will cost some money -- about $100 billion per year. But most of thiscomes from the nearly $2 trillion a year that America already spends on health care -- but a lot of it is notspent wisely. A lot of that money is being wasted or spent badly. So within this plan, we   re going to makesure the dollars we spend go towards making insurance more affordable and more secure. We   re going toeliminate wasteful taxpayer subsidies that currently go to insurance and pharmaceutical companies; set anew fee on insurance companies that stand to gain a lot of money and a lot of profits as millions ofAmericans are able to buy insurance; and we're going to make sure that the wealthiest Americans pay theirfair share on Medicare. The bottom line is our proposal is paid for. And all the new money generated in this plan goes back to smallbusinesses and middle-class families who can't afford health insurance. It would also lower prescriptiondrug prices for seniors. And it would help train new doctors and nurses and physician assistants to providecare for American families. Finally, my proposal would bring down the cost of health care for millions -- families, businesses, and thefederal government. We have now incorporated most of the serious ideas from across the politicalspectrum about how to contain the rising cost of health care -- ideas that go after the waste and abuse inour system, especially in programs like Medicare. But we do this while protecting Medicare benefits, andextending the financial stability of the program by nearly a decade. Our cost-cutting measures mirror most of the proposals in the current Senate bill, which reduces mostpeople's premiums and brings down our deficit by up to a trillion dollars over the next two decades -- bringsdown our deficit. Those aren't my numbers; those are the savings determined by the Congressional BudgetOffice, which is the Washington acronym for the nonpartisan, independent referee of Congress in terms ofhow much stuff costs. So that's our proposal. This is where we've ended up. It's an approach that has been debated andchanged and I believe improved over the last year. It incorporates the best ideas from Democrats andRepublicans -- including some of the ideas that Republicans offered during the health care summit, likefunding state grants on medical malpractice reform, and curbing waste and fraud and abuse in the healthcare system. My proposal also gets rid of many of the provisions that had no place in health care reform --provisions that were more about winning individual votes in Congress than improving health care for allAmericans. Now, despite all that we agree on and all the Republican ideas we've incorporated, many -- probably most --Republicans in Congress just have a fundamental disagreement over whether we should have more or lessoversight of insurance companies. And if they truly believe that less regulation would lead to higher quality,more affordable health insurance, then they should vote against the proposal I've put forward. Now, some also believe that we should, instead of doing what I'm proposing, pursue a piecemeal approachto health insurance reform, where we tinker around the edges of this challenge for the next few years. Eventhose who acknowledge the problem of the uninsured say we just can't afford to help them right now --which is why the Republican proposal only covers 3 million uninsured Americans while we cover over 31million. The problem with that approach is that unless everyone has access to affordable coverage, you can'tprevent insurance companies from denying coverage based on preexisting conditions; you can't limit theamount families are forced to pay out of their own pockets. The insurance reforms rest on everybodyhaving access to coverage. And you also don't do anything about the fact that taxpayers currently end upsubsidizing the uninsured when they're forced to go to the emergency room for care, to the tune of about athousand bucks per family. You can't get those savings if those people are still going to the emergencyroom. So the fact is, health reform only works if you take care of all of these problems at once. Now, both during and after last week's summit, Republicans in Congress insisted that the only acceptablecourse on health care reform is to start over. But given these honest and substantial differences betweenthe parties about the need to regulate the insurance industry and the need to help millions of middle-classfamilies get insurance, I don't see how another year of negotiations would help. Moreover, the insurance companies aren't starting over. They're continuing to raise premiums and denycoverage as we speak. For us to start over now could simply lead to delay that could last for anotherdecade, or even more. The American people, and the U.S. economy, just can't wait that long. So, nomatter which approach you favor, I believe the United States Congress owes the American people a finalvote on health care reform. We have debated this issue thoroughly, not just for the past year but for decades. Reform has alreadypassed the House with a majority. It has already passed the Senate with a supermajority of 60 votes. Andnow it deserves the same kind of up or down vote that was cast on welfare reform, that was cast on theChildren's Health Insurance Program, that was used for COBRA health coverage for the unemployed, and,by the way, for both Bush tax cuts -- all of which had to pass Congress with nothing more than a simplemajority. I, therefore, ask leaders in both houses of Congress to finish their work and schedule a vote in the next fewweeks. From now until then, I will do everything in my power to make the case for reform. And I urge everyAmerican who wants this reform to make their voice heard as well -- every family, every business, everypatient, every doctor, every nurse, every physician   s assistant. Make your voice heard. This has been a long and wrenching debate. It has stoked great passions among the American people andtheir representatives. And that's because health care is a difficult issue. It is a complicated issue. If it waseasy, it would have been solved long ago. As all of you know from experience, health care can literally bean issue of life or death. And as a result, it easily lends itself to demagoguery and political gamesmanship,and misrepresentation and misunderstanding. But that   s not an excuse for those of us who were sent here to lead. That's not an excuse for us to walkaway. We can   t just give up because the politics are hard. I know there   s been a fascination, bordering onobsession, in this media town about what passing health insurance reform would mean for the next electionand the one after that. How will this play? What will happen with the polls? I will leave it to others to siftthrough the politics, because that   s not what this is about. That   s not why we   re here. This is about what reform would mean for the mother with breast cancer whose insurance company willfinally have to pay for her chemotherapy. This is about what reform would mean for the small businessowner who will no longer have to choose between hiring more workers or offering coverage to theemployees she has. This is about what reform would mean for middle-class families who will be able toafford health insurance for the very first time in their lives and get a regular checkup once in a while, andhave some security about their children if they get sick. This is about what reform would mean for all those men and women I   ve met over the last few years who   vebeen brave enough to share their stories. When we started our push for reform last year, I talked to a youngmother in Wisconsin named Laura Klitzka. She has two young children. She thought she had beaten herbreast cancer but then later discovered it had spread to her bones. She and her husband were working andhad insurance, but their medical bills still landed them in debt. And now she spends time worrying aboutthat debt when all she wants to do is spend time with her children and focus on getting well. This should not happen in the United States of America. And it doesn   t have to. In the end, that's what this debate is about. It's about what kind of country we want to be. It's about themillions of lives that would be touched and, in some cases, saved by making private health insurance moresecure and more affordable. So at stake right now is not just our ability to solve this problem, but our ability to solve any problem. TheAmerican people want to know if it's still possible for Washington to look out for their interests and theirfuture. They are waiting for us to act. They are waiting for us to lead. And as long as I hold this office, Iintend to provide that leadership. I do not know how this plays politically, but I know it's right. And so I askCongress to finish its work, and I look forward to signing this reform into law. Thank you very much, everybody. Let's get it done.",obama
"Lost in the news of the week was a headline that ought to be a source of concern for everyAmerican. It said,    Many Nations Passing U.S. in Education.    Now, debates in Washingtontend to be consumed with the politics of the moment: who   s up in the daily polls; whose partystands to gain in November. But what matters to you -- what matters to our country -- is notwhat happens in the next election, but what we do to lift up the next generation. And the factis, there are few issues that speak more directly to our long term success as a nation thanissues concerning the education we provide to our children. Our prosperity in the 20th century was fueled by an education system that helped grow themiddle class and unleash the talents of our people more fully and widely than at any time inour history. We built schools and focused on the teaching of math and science. We helped ageneration of veterans go to college through the GI Bill. We led the globe in producing collegegraduates, and in turn we led in producing ground-breaking technologies and scientificdiscoveries that lifted living standards and set us apart as the world   s engine of innovation. Of course, other nations recognize this, and are looking to gain an edge in the globalmarketplace by investing in better schools, supporting teachers, and committing to clearstandards that will produce graduates with more skills. Our competitors understand that thenation that out-educates us today will out-compete us tomorrow. Yet, too often we havefailed to make inroads in reforming and strengthening our public education system -- thedebate mired in worn arguments hurled across entrenched divides. As a result, over the last few decades, we   ve lost ground. One assessment shows Americanfifteen year olds no longer even near the top in math and science when compared to theirpeers around the world. As referenced in the news report I mentioned, we   ve now fallenbehind most wealthy countries in our high school graduation rates. And while we once led theworld in the proportion of college graduates we produced, today we no longer do. Not only does that risk our leadership as a nation, it consigns millions of Americans to a lesserfuture. For we know that the level of education a person attains is increasingly a prerequisitefor success and a predictor of the income that person will earn throughout his or her life. Beyond the economic statistics is a less tangible but no less painful reality: unless we takeaction -- unless we step up -- there are countless children who will never realize their fulltalent and potential. I don   t accept that future for them. And I don   t accept that future for the United States ofAmerica. That   s why we   re engaged in a historic effort to redeem and improve our public schools: to raise the expectations for our students and for ourselves, to recognize and rewardexcellence, to improve performance in troubled schools, and to give our kids and our countrythe best chance to succeed in a changing world. Under the leadership of an outstanding Education Secretary, Arne Duncan, we launched aRace to the Top, through which states compete for funding by committing to reform andraising standards, by rewarding good teaching, by supporting the development of betterassessments to measure results, and by emphasizing math and science to help preparechildren for college and careers. And on Monday, my administration will send to Congress our blueprint for an updatedElementary and Secondary Education Act to overhaul No Child Left Behind. What this planrecognizes is that while the federal government can play a leading role in encouraging thereforms and high standards we need, the impetus for that change will come from states, andfrom local schools and school districts. So, yes, we set a high bar -- but we also provideeducators the flexibility to reach it. Under these guidelines, schools that achieve excellence or show real progress will berewarded, and local districts will be encouraged to commit to change in schools that areclearly letting their students down. For the majority of schools that fall in between -- schoolsthat do well but could do better -- we will encourage continuous improvement to help keepour young people on track for a bright future: prepared for the jobs of the 21st century. And because the most important factor in a child   s success is the person standing at the frontof the classroom, we will better prepare teachers, support teachers, and encourage teachersto stay in the field. In short, we   ll treat the people who educate our sons and daughters likethe professionals they are. Through this plan we are setting an ambitious goal: All students should graduate from highschool prepared for college and a career -- no matter who you are or where you come from. Achieving this goal will be difficult. It will take time. And it will require the skills, talents, anddedication of many: principals, teachers, parents, students. But this effort is essential for ourchildren and for our country. And while there will always be those cynics who claim it can   t bedone, at our best, we know that America has always risen to the challenges that we   ve faced. This challenge is no different. As a nation, we are engaged in many important endeavors: improving the economy,reforming the health care system, encouraging innovation in energy and other growthindustries of the 21st century. But our success in these efforts -- and our success in thefuture as a people -- will ultimately depend on what happens long before an entrepreneuropens his doors, or a nurse walks the rounds, or a scientist steps into her laboratory. Ourfuture is determined each and every day, when our children enter the classroom, ready tolearn and brimming with promise. It   s that promise we must help them fulfill. Thank you.",obama
"Mr. President, I rise, first, to offer strong words of support for the statement that was justoffered by the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts. I, as well, rise today to speak insupport of the Iraq resolution that the Senate will consider tomorrow. Mr. President, the news from Iraq is very bad. Last week, a suicide bomber stood outside abookstore and killed 20 people. Other attacks killed 118 Shia pilgrims. On Sunday, a car bombwent off in central Baghdad, and more than 30 people died. And the road from the airport intoBaghdad is littered with smoldering debris, craters from improvised explosive devices, and thememories of our sons and daughters. Mr. President, the civil war in Iraq rages on. The insurgents have started to change theirtactics. They hide in buildings and along the streets and wait for our helicopters. They've shotdown at least eight U.S. helicopters in the last month. More of our soldiers are dying andcoming home with their bodies broken and their nerves shattered at a VA system completelyunprepared for what they need to rebuild their lives. Mr. President, it is not enough for the President to tell us that victory in this war is simply amatter of American resolve. The American people have been extraordinarily resolved. They'veseen their sons and daughters killed or wounded in the streets of Fallujah. They've spenthundreds of billions of dollars on this effort -- money that they know could have been devotedto strengthening our homeland security and our competitive standing as a Nation. The failurehas not been a failure of resolve. That's not what's led us into chaos. It's been a failure ofstrategy; and it's time that the strategy change. There is no military solution, Mr. President, tothe civil war that rages on in Iraq; and it's time for us to redeploy so that a political solutionbecomes possible. The news from Iraq is very bad, and it's been that way for at least four years. We all wish the-- that the land the President and the Vice President speak of exists. We wish that there wasan Iraq where the insurgency was in the last throes, where the people work with security,where children play outside, where a vibrant new democracy lights up the nighttime sky. Wewish for those things, but there's no alternative reality to what we see and read about in thenews, to what we've experienced these long four years. I repeat, Mr. President, there is no military solution to this war. At this point, no amount ofsoldiers can solve the grievances at the heart of someone else's civil war. The Iraqi people --Shia, Sunni, and Kurd -- must come to the table and reach a political settlement themselves.If they want peace, they must do the hard work necessary to achieve it. Our failed strategy in Iraq has strengthened Iran's strategic position, reduced U.S. credibilityand influence around the world, placed Israel and other nations friendly to the United Statesin the region in greater peril. These are not the signs of a well-laid plan. It's time for aprofound change. This is what we're trying to do here today. We're saying it is time to start making plans toredeploy our troops so that they can focus on the wider struggle against terrorism, win thewar in Afghanistan, strengthen our position in the Middle East, and pressure the Iraqis toreach a political settlement. Even if this effort falls short, we will continue to try to accomplishwhat the American people asked for last November. I'm glad to see, though, that this new effort is gaining consensus. And I want to commendSenator Reid for his efforts. He took the time to listen -- so many of us from both Chambersof Congress could help develop this plan. The decision in particular to begin a phased redeployment, with the goal of redeploying all ourcombat forces by March 31st, 2008, is the right step. It's a measure the Iraq Study Groupspoke of, an idea I borrowed from them, an idea that, in a bill I introduced, now has morethan 60 cosponsors from House and Senate and from both sides of the aisle. They'vesupported this plan since I announced a similar plan in January. The decision allows some U.S. forces to remain in Iraq with a clear mission to protect U.S. andcoalition personnel, conduct counterterrorism operations, and to train and equip Iraqi forces;and that is a smart decision. President al-Maliki spoke at a conference and warned that theviolence in Iraq could spread throughout the region if it goes unchecked. By maintaining astrong presence in Iraq and the Middle East, as both my bill and the leadership bill does, wecan ensure that the chaos does not spread. I should also add that the decision to begin this phased redeployment within 120 days is apractical one. Our military options have been exhausted. It's time to seek a political solutionto this war, and with this decision we send a clear signal to the parties involved that they needto arrive at an accommodation. Mr. President, while I strongly believe that this war never should have been authorized, Ibelieve we must be as careful in ending the war as we were careless getting in. While I prefermy approach, as reflected in my bill, I believe that this new resolution does begin to pointU.S. policy in Iraq and the region in the right direction. An end to the war, and achieving apolitical solution to Iraq's civil war, will not happen unless we demand it. Peace with stability doesn't just happen because we wish for it. It comes when we never givein and never give up and never tire of working towards a life on Earth worthy of our humandignity. The decisions that have been made have led us to this crossroads -- a moment ofgreat peril, Mr. President. We have a choice. We can continue down the road that's weakened our credibility anddamaged our strategic interests in the region or we can turn toward the future. The roadwon't be smooth, and I have to say, Mr. President, that there will be risks with any approach.But this approach is our last best hope to end this war so we can begin to bring our troopshome and begin the hard work of securing our country and our world from the threats that weface. The President has said he will continue down the road towards more troops and more of thesame failed policies. The President sought and won authorization from Congress to wage thiswar from the start. But he is now dismissing and ignoring the will of the American people, thatis tired of years of watching the human and financial tolls mount. Mr. President, the news from Iraq is very bad, but it can change if we in this Chamber say""enough."" Let this day be the day that begins the painful and difficult work of moving fromthis crossroad. Let this be the day that we begin pulling towards the future with a responsibleconclusion to this painful chapter in our Nation's history. Mr. President, let this be the daywhen we finally send a message that is so clear and so emphatic that it cannot be ignored. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.",obama
