"Thank you very much.Good evening, my fellow Americans. I appreciate so very much the opportunity to speak withyou tonight.Mr. Speaker, Lieutenant Governor, friends, distinguished guests, our country has beenthrough a long and trying period, with the outcome of the presidential election not finalized forlonger than any of us could ever imagine.Vice President Gore and I put our hearts and hopes into our campaigns. We both gave it ourall. We shared similar emotions, so I understand how difficult this moment must be for VicePresident Gore and his family.He has a distinguished record of service to our country as a congressman, a senator and avice president.This evening I received a gracious call from the vice president. We agreed to meet early nextweek in Washington, and we agreed to do our best to heal our country after this hard-foughtcontest.Tonight I want to thank all the thousands of volunteers and campaign workers who worked sohard on my behalf.I also salute the vice president and his supports for waging a spirited campaign. And I thankhim for a call that I know was difficult to make. Laura and I wish the vice president andSenator Lieberman and their families the very best.I have a lot to be thankful for tonight. I'm thankful for America and thankful that we were ableto resolve our electoral differences in a peaceful way.I'm thankful to the American people for the great privilege of being able to serve as your nextpresident.I want to thank my wife and our daughters for their love. Laura's active involvement as firstlady has made Texas a better place, and she will be a wonderful first lady of America.I am proud to have Dick Cheney by my side, and America will be proud to have him as ournext vice president.Tonight, I chose to speak from the chamber of the Texas House of Representatives because ithas been a home to bipartisan cooperation. Here in a place where Democrats have themajority, Republicans and Democrats have worked together to do what is right for the peoplewe represent.We've had spirited disagreements. And in the end, we found constructive consensus. It is anexperience I will always carry with me, an example I will always follow.I want to thank my friend, House Speaker Pete Laney, a Democrat, who introduced me today.I want to thank the legislators from both political parties with whom I've worked.Across the hall in our Texas capitol is the state Senate. And I cannot help but think of ourmutual friend, the former Democrat lieutenant governor, Bob Bullock. His love for Texas andhis ability to work in a bipartisan way continue to be a model for all of us.The spirit of cooperation I have seen in this hall is what is needed in Washington, D.C. It isthe challenge of our moment. After a difficult election, we must put politics behind us andwork together to make the promise of America available for every one of our citizens.I'm optimistic that we can change the tone in Washington, D.C.I believe things happen for a reason, and I hope the long wait of the last five weeks willheighten a desire to move beyond the bitterness and partisanship of the recent past.Our nation must rise above a house divided. Americans share hopes and goals and values farmore important than any political disagreements.Republicans want the best for our nation, and so do Democrats. Our votes may differ, but notour hopes.I know America wants reconciliation and unity. I know Americans want progress. And we mustseize this moment and deliver.Together, guided by a spirit of common sense, common courtesy and common goals, we canunite and inspire the American citizens.Together, we will work to make all our public schools excellent, teaching every student ofevery background and every accent, so that no child is left behind.Together, we will save Social Security and renew its promise of a secure retirement forgenerations to come.Together, we will strengthen Medicare and offer prescription drug coverage to all of ourseniors.Together, we will give Americans the broad, fair, and fiscally responsible tax relief theydeserve.Together, we'll have a bipartisan foreign policy true to our values and true to our friends, andwe will have a military equal to every challenge and superior to every adversary.Together, we will address some of society's deepest problems one person at a time, byencouraging and empowering the good hearts and good works of the American people.This is the essence of compassionate conservatism and it will be a foundation of myadministration.These priorities are not merely Republican concerns or Democratic concerns; they areAmerican responsibilities.During the fall campaign, we differed about the details of these proposals, but there wasremarkable consensus about the important issues before us: excellent schools, retirement andhealth security, tax relief, a strong military, a more civil society.We have discussed our differences. Now it is time to find common ground and build consensusto make America a beacon of opportunity in the 21st century.I'm optimistic this can happen. Our future demands it and our history proves it. Two hundredyears ago, in the election of 1800, America faced another close presidential election. A tie inthe Electoral College put the outcome into the hands of Congress.After six days of voting and 36 ballots, the House of Representatives elected Thomas Jeffersonthe third president of the United States. That election brought the first transfer of power fromone party to another in our new democracy.Shortly after the election, Jefferson, in a letter titled ""Reconciliation and Reform,"" wrote this:""The steady character of our countrymen is a rock to which we may safely moor; unequivocalin principle, reasonable in manner. We should be able to hope to do a great deal of good tothe cause of freedom and harmony.""Two hundred years have only strengthened the steady character of America. And so as webegin the work of healing our nation, tonight I call upon that character: respect for eachother, respect for our differences, generosity of spirit, and a willingness to work hard andwork together to solve any problem.I have something else to ask you, to ask every American. I ask for you to pray for this greatnation. I ask for your prayers for leaders from both parties. I thank you for your prayers forme and my family, and I ask you to pray for Vice President Gore and his family.I have faith that with God's help we as a nation will move forward together as one nation,indivisible. And together we will create an America that is open, so every citizen has access tothe American dream; an America that is educated, so every child has the keys to realize thatdream; and an America that is united in our diversity and our shared American values that arelarger than race or party.I was not elected to serve one party, but to serve one nation.The president of the United States is the president of every single American, of every race andevery background.Whether you voted for me or not, I will do my best to serve your interests and I will work toearn your respect.I will be guided by President Jefferson's sense of purpose, to stand for principle, to bereasonable in manner, and above all, to do great good for the cause of freedom and harmony.The presidency is more than an honor. It is more than an office. It is a charge to keep, and Iwill give it my all.Thank you very much and God bless America.",bush

"We are here in the middle hour of our grief. So many have suffered so great a loss, and todaywe express our nation's sorrow. We come before God to pray for the missing and the dead,and for those who loved them. On Tuesday, our country was attacked with deliberate andmassive cruelty. We have seen the images of fire and ashes and bent steel.Now come the names, the list of casualties we are only beginning to read: They are the names of men and women who began their day at a desk or in an airport,busy with life.They are the names of people who faced death and in their last moments called hometo say, be brave and I love you.They are the names of passengers who defied their murderers and prevented themurder of others on the ground. They are the names of men and women who wore the uniform of the United States anddied at their posts. They are the names of rescuers -- the ones whom death found running up the stairsand into the fires to help others.We will read all these names. We will linger over them and learn their stories, and manyAmericans will weep.To the children and parents and spouses and families and friends of the lost, we offer thedeepest sympathy of the nation. And I assure you, you are not alone. Just three daysremoved from these events, Americans do not yet have the distance of history, but ourresponsibility to history is already clear: to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil.War has been waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder. This nation is peaceful, butfierce when stirred to anger. This conflict was begun on the timing and terms of others; it willend in a way and at an hour of our choosing. Our purpose as a nation is firm, yet our woundsas a people are recent and unhealed and lead us to pray. In many of our prayers this week,there's a searching and an honesty. At St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York, on Tuesday, awoman said, ""I pray to God to give us a sign that He's still here.""Others have prayed for the same, searching hospital to hospital, carrying pictures of those stillmissing. God's signs are not always the ones we look for. We learn in tragedy that Hispurposes are not always our own, yet the prayers of private suffering, whether in our homesor in this great cathedral are known and heard and understood. There are prayers that help uslast through the day or endure the night. There are prayers of friends and strangers that giveus strength for the journey, and there are prayers that yield our will to a Will greater than ourown.This world He created is of moral design. Grief and tragedy and hatred are only for a time.Goodness, remembrance and love have no end, and the Lord of life holds all who die and allwho mourn.It is said that adversity introduces us to ourselves. This is true of a nation as well. In this trial,we have been reminded and the world has seen that our fellow Americans are generous andkind, resourceful and brave.We see our national character in rescuers working past exhaustion, in long lines of blooddonors, in thousands of citizens who have asked to work and serve in any way possible. And we have seen our national character in eloquent acts of sacrifice: Inside the World Trade Center, one man who could have saved himself stayed until theend and at the side of his quadriplegic friend.A beloved priest died giving the last rites to a firefighter.Two office workers, finding a disabled stranger, carried her down 68 floors to safety.A group of men drove through the night from Dallas to Washington to bring skin graftsfor burned victims. In these acts and many others, Americans showed a deep commitment to one another and anabiding love for our country.Today, we feel what Franklin Roosevelt called, ""the warm courage of national unity."" This is aunity of every faith and every background. It has joined together political parties and bothhouses of Congress. It is evident in services of prayer and candlelight vigils and Americanflags, which are displayed in pride and waved in defiance. Our unity is a kinship of grief and asteadfast resolve to prevail against our enemies. And this unity against terror is nowextending across the world.America is a nation full of good fortune, with so much to be grateful for, but we are not sparedfrom suffering. In every generation, the world has produced enemies of human freedom. Theyhave attacked America because we are freedom's home and defender, and the commitment ofour Fathers is now the calling of our time.On this national day of prayer and remembrance, we ask Almighty God to watch over ournation and grant us patience and resolve in all that is to come. We pray that He will comfortand console those who now walk in sorrow. We thank Him for each life we now must mourn,and the promise of a life to come.As we've been assured, neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities, nor powers northings present nor things to come nor height nor depth can separate us from God's love.May He bless the souls of the departed. May He comfort our own. And may He always guideour country.  God bless America.",bush
"Good morning. This weekend I am engaged in extensive sessions with members of myNational Security Council, as we plan a comprehensive assault on terrorism. This will be adifferent kind of conflict against a different kind of enemy. This is a conflict without battlefields or beachheads, a conflict with opponents who believethey are invisible. Yet, they are mistaken. They will be exposed, and they will discover whatothers in the past have learned: Those who make war against the United States have chosentheir own destruction. Victory against terrorism will not take place in a single battle, but in aseries of decisive actions against terrorist organizations and those who harbor and supportthem. We are planning a broad and sustained campaign to secure our country and eradicate the evilof terrorism. And we are determined to see this conflict through. Americans of every faith andbackground are committed to this goal. Yesterday I visited the site of the destruction in New York City and saw an amazing spirit ofsacrifice and patriotism and defiance. I met with rescuers who have worked past exhaustion,who cheered for our country and the great cause we have entered.In Washington, D.C., the political parties and both Houses of Congress have shown aremarkable unity, and I'm deeply grateful. A terrorist attack designed to tear us apart hasinstead bound us together as a nation. Over the past few days, we have learned much aboutAmerican courage -- the courage of firefighters and police officers who suffered so great aloss, the courage of passengers aboard United 93 who may well have fought with thehijackers and saved many lives on the ground. Now we honor those who died, and prepare to respond to these attacks on our nation. I willnot settle for a token act. Our response must be sweeping, sustained, and effective. We havemuch do to, and much to ask of the American people. You will be asked for your patience -- for the conflict will not be short. You will be asked forresolve -- for the conflict will not be easy. You will be asked for your strength, because thecourse to victory may be long.In the past week, we have seen the American people at their very best everywhere inAmerica. Citizens have come together to pray, to give blood, to fly our country'sflag. Americans are coming together to share their grief and gain strength from one another. Great tragedy has come to us, and we are meeting it with the best that is in our country, withcourage and concern for others: because this is America. This is who we are. This is what ourenemies hate and have attacked. And this is why we will prevail. Thank you for listening.",bush

"Good afternoon. On my orders, the United States military has begun strikes against Al Qaedaterrorist training camps and military installations of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. Thesecarefully targeted actions are designed to disrupt the use of Afghanistan as a terrorist base ofoperations and to attack the military capability of the Taliban regime.We are joined in this operation by our staunch friend, Great Britain. Other close friends,including Canada, Australia, Germany and France, have pledged forces as the operationunfolds. More than 40 countries in the Middle East, Africa, Europe, and across Asia havegranted air transit or landing rights. Many more have shared intelligence. We are supportedby the collective will of the world.More than two weeks ago, I gave Taliban leaders a series of clear and specific demands: Closeterrorist training camps; hand over leaders of the Al Qaeda network; and return all foreignnationals, including American citizens, unjustly detained in your country. None of thesedemands was met. And now, the Taliban will pay a price.By destroying camps and disrupting communications, we will make it more difficult for theterror network to train new recruits and coordinate their evil plans. Initially the terrorists mayburrow deeper into caves and other entrenched hiding places. Our military action is alsodesigned to clear the way for sustained, comprehensive, and relentless operations to drivethem out and bring them to justice.At the same time, the oppressed people of Afghanistan will know the generosity of Americaand our allies. As we strike military targets, we will also drop food, medicine, and supplies tothe starving and suffering men and women and children of Afghanistan. The United States ofAmerica is a friend to the Afghan people, and we are the friends of almost a billion worldwidewho practice the Islamic faith. The United States of America is an enemy of those who aidterrorists and of the barbaric criminals who profane a great religion by committing murder inits name. This military action is a part of our campaign against terrorism, another front in awar that has already been joined through diplomacy, intelligence, the freezing of financialassets, and the arrests of known terrorists by law-enforcement agents in 38 countries.Given the nature and reach of our enemies, we will win this conflict by the patientaccumulation of successes, by meeting a series of challenges with determination, and will, andpurpose. Today we focus on Afghanistan, but the battle is broader. Every nation has a choiceto make. In this conflict, there is no neutral ground. If any government sponsors the outlawsand killers of innocence, they have become outlaws and murderers themselves. And they willtake that lonely path at their own peril.I'm speaking to you today from the Treaty Room of the White House, a place where Americanpresidents have worked for peace. We're a peaceful nation. Yet, as we have learned, sosuddenly and so tragically, there can be no peace in a world of sudden terror. In the face oftoday's new threat, the only way to pursue peace is to pursue those who threaten it. We didnot ask for this mission, but we will fulfill it.The name of today's military operation is Enduring Freedom. We defend not only our preciousfreedoms, but also the freedom of people everywhere to live and raise their children free fromfear. I know many Americans feel fear today. And our government is taking strong precautions. Alllaw enforcement and intelligence agencies are working aggressively around America, aroundthe world -- and around the clock. At my request, many governors have activated the NationalGuard to strengthen airport security. We have called up reserves to reinforce our militarycapability and strengthen the protection of our homeland.In the months ahead, our patience will be one of our strengths -- patience with the long waitsthat will result from tighter security, patience and understanding that it will take time toachieve our goals, patience in all the sacrifices that may come. Today, those sacrifices arebeing made by members of our armed forces who now defend us so far from home, and bytheir proud and worried families.A Commander-in-Chief sends America's sons and daughters into battle in a foreign land onlyafter the greatest care and a lot of prayer. We ask a lot of those who wear our uniform. Weask them to leave their loved ones, to travel great distances, to risk injury, even to beprepared to make the ultimate sacrifice of their lives. They are dedicated. They are honorable.They represent the best of our country, and we are grateful.To all the men and women in our military -- every sailor, every soldier, every airman, everyCoast Guardsman, every Marine -- I say this: Your mission is defined; your objectives areclear; your goal is just. You have my full confidence, and you will have every tool you need tocarry out your duty.I recently received a touching letter that says a lot about the state of America in these difficulttimes, a letter from a fourth-grade girl with a father in the military: ""As much as I don't wantmy dad to fight,"" she wrote, ""I'm willing to give him to you."" This is a precious gift. Thegreatest she could give. This young girl knows what America is all about. Since September 11,an entire generation of young Americans has gained new understanding of the value offreedom and its cost and duty and its sacrifice.The battle is now joined on many fronts. We will not waiver, we will not tire, we will not falter,and we will not fail. Peace and freedom will prevail. Thank you. May God continue to bless America.",bush
"Please be seated.  President and Senator Clinton, thank you all for being here.  We have comehere to pay our respects to 125 men and women who died in the service of America.  We alsoremember 64 passengers on a hijacked plane; those men and women, boys and girls who fellinto the hands of evildoers, and also died here exactly one month ago. On September 11th, great sorrow came to our country.  And from that sorrow has come greatresolve.  Today, we are a nation awakened to the evil of terrorism, and determined to destroyit.  That work began the moment we were attacked; and it will continue until justice isdelivered. Americans are returning, as we must, to the normal pursuits of life.  Americans are returning,as we must, to the normal pursuits of life.  But we know that if you lost a son or daughterhere, or a husband, or a wife, or a mom or dad, life will never again be as it was.  The losswas sudden, and hard, and permanent.  So difficult to explain.  So difficult to accept.Three schoolchildren traveling with their teacher.  An Army general. A budget analyst whoreported to work here for 30 years.  A lieutenant commander in the Naval Reserve who leftbehind a wife, a four-year-old son, and another child on the way. One life touches so many others.  One death can leave sorrow that seems almostunbearable.  But to all of you who lost someone here, I want to say:  You are not alone.  TheAmerican people will never forget the cruelty that was done here and in New York, and in thesky over Pennsylvania. We will never forget all the innocent people killed by the hatred of a few.  We know theloneliness you feel in your loss.  The entire nation, the entire nation shares in yoursadness.  And we pray for you and your loved ones.  And we will always honor their memory. The hijackers were instruments of evil who died in vain.  Behind them is a cult of evil whichseeks to harm the innocent and thrives on human suffering.  Theirs is the worst kind ofcruelty, the cruelty that is fed, not weakened, by tears.  Theirs is the worst kind of violence,pure malice, while daring to claim the authority of God.  We cannot fully understand thedesigns and power of evil.  It is enough to know that evil, like goodness, exists.  And in theterrorists, evil has found a willing servant. In New York, the terrorists chose as their target a symbol of America's freedom andconfidence.  Here, they struck a symbol of our strength in the world.  And the attack on thePentagon, on that day, was more symbolic than they knew.  It was on another September11th -- September 11th, 1941 -- that construction on this building first began. America wasjust then awakening to another menace:  The Nazi terror in Europe. And on that very night, President Franklin Roosevelt spoke to the nation.  ""The danger,"" hewarned, ""has long ceased to be a mere possibility. The danger is here now -- not only from amilitary enemy, but from an enemy of all law, all liberty, all morality, all religion.""For us too, in the year 2001, an enemy has emerged that rejects every limit of law, morality,and religion.  The terrorists have no true home in any country, or culture, or faith.  They dwellin dark corners of earth. And there, we will find them.This week, I have called -- This week, I have called the Armed Forces into action.  One byone, we are eliminating power centers of a regime that harbors al Qaeda terrorists.  We gavethat regime a choice: Turn over the terrorists, or face your ruin.  They chose unwisely.The Taliban regime has brought nothing but fear and misery to the people ofAfghanistan.  These rulers call themselves holy men, even with their record of drawing moneyfrom heroin trafficking.  They consider themselves pious and devout, while subjecting womento fierce brutality. The Taliban has allied itself with murderers and gave them shelter. But today, for al Qaedaand the Taliban, there is no shelter.  As Americans did 60 years ago, we have entered astruggle of uncertain duration.  But now, as then, we can be certain of the outcome, becausewe have a number of decisive assets. We have a unified country.  We have the patience to fight and win on many fronts:  Blockingterrorist plans, seizing their funds, arresting their networks, disrupting their communications,opposing their sponsors. And we have one more great asset in this cause:  The brave menand women of the United States military.From my first days in this office, I have felt and seen the strong spirit of the Armed Forces.I saw it at Fort Stewart, Georgia, when I first reviewed our troops as Commander-in-Chief,and looked into the faces of proud and determined soldiers.  I saw it in Annapolis on agraduation day; at Camp Pendleton in California; Camp Bondsteel in Kosovo. And I have seenthis spirit at the Pentagon, before and after the attack on this building. You've responded to a great emergency with calm and courage.  And for that, your countryhonors you.  A Commander-in-Chief must know -- must know -- that he can count on the skilland readiness of servicemen and women at every point in the chain of command.  You havegiven me that confidence. And I give you these commitments.  The wound to this building will not be forgotten, but itwill be repaired.  Brick by brick, we will quickly rebuild the Pentagon.  In the missions aheadfor the military, you will have everything you need, every resource, every weapon, everymeans to assure full victory for the United States and the cause of freedom.And I pledge to you that America will never relent on this war against terror.  There will betimes of swift, dramatic action.  There will be times of steady, quiet progress.  Over time, withpatience, and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.  They will be isolated, surrounded,cornered, until there is no place to run, or hide, or rest.As military and civilian personnel in the Pentagon, you are an important part of the strugglewe have entered.  You know the risks of your calling, and you have willingly acceptedthem.  You believe in our country, and our country believes in you.Within sight of this building is Arlington [National] Cemetery, the final resting place of manythousands who died for our country over the generations. Enemies of America have nowadded to these graves, and they wish to add more.  Unlike our enemies, we value every life,and we mourn every loss. Yet we're not afraid.  Our cause is just, and worthy of sacrifice. Our nation is strong of heart,firm of purpose.  Inspired by all the courage that has come before, we will meet our momentand we will prevail.May God bless you all, and may God bless America.",bush
"Good morning and welcome to the White House.  Today, we take an essential step indefeating terrorism, while protecting the constitutional rights of all Americans.  With mysignature, this law will give intelligence and law enforcement officials important new tools tofight a present danger. I commend the House and Senate for the hard work they put into this legislation.  Members ofCongress and their staffs spent long nights and weekends to get this important bill to mydesk.  I appreciate their efforts, and bipartisanship, in passing this new law. I want to thank the Vice President and his staff for working hard to make sure this law waspassed.  I want to thank the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Treasury for being here,both of whom lead important parts of our war against terrorism.  I want to thank AttorneyGeneral John Ashcroft for spending a lot of time on the Hill to make the case for a balancedpiece of legislation.  I want to thank the Director of the FBI and the Director of the CIA forwaging an incredibly important part on the two-front war -- one overseas, and a front here athome.I want to thank Governor Tom Ridge for his leadership.  I want to thank the members ofCongress who are here on the stage, the Leaders, on this impressive effort.  Senator Hatchand Senator Leahy and Senator Sarbanes and Senator Graham and Senator Reid. I also want to thank Representative Porter Goss, LaFalce, Oxley, and Sensenbrenner for theirhard work.  And I want to welcome the men and women of law enforcement who are here inthe White House with us today, as well. The changes, effective today, will help counter a threat like no other our nation has everfaced.  We've seen the enemy, and the murder of thousands of innocent, unsuspectingpeople.  They recognize no barrier of morality.  They have no conscience.  The terroristscannot be reasoned with.  Witness the recent anthrax attacks through our Postal Service. Our country is grateful for the courage the Postal Service has shown during these difficulttimes.  We mourn the loss of the lives of Thomas Morris and Joseph Curseen; postal workerswho died in the line of duty. And our prayers go to their loved ones. I want to assure postal workers that our government is testing more than 200 postal facilitiesalong the entire Eastern corridor that may have been impacted.  And we will move quickly totreat and protect workers where positive exposures are found. But one thing is for certain:  These terrorists must be pursued, they must be defeated, andthey must be brought to justice.  (Applause.)  And that is the purpose of thislegislation.  Since the 11th of September, the men and women of our intelligence and lawenforcement agencies have been relentless in their response to new and sudden challenges. We have seen the horrors terrorists can inflict.  We may never know what horrors our countrywas spared by the diligent and determined work of our police forces, the FBI, ATF agents,federal marshals, Custom officers, Secret Service, intelligence professionals and local lawenforcement officials, under the most trying conditions.  They are serving this country withexcellence, and often with bravery. They deserve our full support and every means of help that we can provide.  We're dealingwith terrorists who operate by highly sophisticated methods and technologies, some of whichwere not even available when our existing laws were written.  The bill before me takesaccount of the new realities and dangers posed by modern terrorists.  It will help lawenforcement to identify, to dismantle, to disrupt, and to punish terrorists before they strike.For example, this legislation gives law enforcement officials better tools to put an end tofinancial counterfeiting, smuggling and money-laundering.  Secondly, it gives intelligenceoperations and criminal operations the chance to operate not on separate tracks, but to sharevital information so necessary to disrupt a terrorist attack before it occurs. As of today, we're changing the laws governing information-sharing. And as importantly, we'rechanging the culture of our various agencies that fight terrorism.  Countering andinvestigating terrorist activity is the number one priority for both law enforcement andintelligence agencies. Surveillance of communications is another essential tool to pursue and stop terrorists.  Theexisting law was written in the era of rotary telephones.  This new law that I sign today willallow surveillance of all communications used by terrorists, including e-mails, the Internet,and cell phones. As of today, we'll be able to better meet the technological challenges posed by thisproliferation of communications technology.  Investigations are often slowed by limit on thereach of federal search warrants. Law enforcement agencies have to get a new warrant for each new district they investigate,even when they're after the same suspect.  Under this new law, warrants are valid across alldistricts and across all states.  And, finally, the new legislation greatly enhances the penaltiesthat will fall on terrorists or anyone who helps them. Current statutes deal more severely with drug-traffickers than with terrorists.  That changestoday.  We are enacting new and harsh penalties for possession of biological weapons.  We'remaking it easier to seize the assets of groups and individuals involved in terrorism. Thegovernment will have wider latitude in deporting known terrorists and their supporters. Thestatute of limitations on terrorist acts will be lengthened, as will prison sentences forterrorists. This bill was carefully drafted and considered.  Led by the members of Congress on this stage,and those seated in the audience, it was crafted with skill and care, determination and a spiritof bipartisanship for which the entire nation is grateful.  This bill met with an overwhelming --overwhelming agreement in Congress, because it upholds and respects the civil libertiesguaranteed by our Constitution.This legislation is essential not only to pursuing and punishing terrorists, but also preventingmore atrocities in the hands of the evil ones.  This government will enforce this law with allthe urgency of a nation at war.  The elected branches of our government, and both politicalparties, are united in our resolve to fight and stop and punish those who would do harm to theAmerican people. It is now my honor to sign into law the USA Patriot Act of 2001.",bush
"We meet in a hall devoted to peace, in a city scarred by violence, in a nation awakened todanger, in a world uniting for a long struggle.  Every civilized nation here today is resolved tokeep the most basic commitment of civilization: We will defend ourselves and our futureagainst terror and lawless violence.The United Nations was founded in this cause.  In a second world war, we learned there is noisolation from evil.  We affirmed that some crimes are so terrible they offend humanity,itself.  And we resolved that the aggressions and ambitions of the wicked must be opposedearly, decisively, and collectively, before they threaten us all.  That evil has returned, and thatcause is renewed.A few miles from here, many thousands still lie in a tomb of rubble. Tomorrow, the SecretaryGeneral, the President of the General Assembly, and I will visit that site, where the names of every nation and region that lost citizens will be read aloud.  If we were to read the names ofevery person who died, it would take more than three hours.Those names include a citizen of Gambia, whose wife spent their fourth wedding anniversary,September the 12th, searching in vain for her husband. Those names include a man whosupported his wife in Mexico, sending home money every week.  Those names include ayoung Pakistani who prayed toward Mecca five times a day, and died that day trying to saveothers.The suffering of September the 11th was inflicted on people of many faiths and manynations.  All of the victims, including Muslims, were killed with equal indifference and equalsatisfaction by the terrorist leaders.  The terrorists are violating the tenets of every religion,including the one they invoke.Last week, the Sheikh of Al-Azhar University, the world's oldest Islamic institution of higherlearning, declared that terrorism is a disease, and that Islam prohibits killing innocentcivilians.  The terrorists call their cause holy, yet, they fund it with drug dealing; theyencourage murder and suicide in the name of a great faith that forbids both.  They dare to askGod's blessing as they set out to kill innocent men, women and children.  But the God of Isaacand Ishmael would never answer such a prayer.  And a murderer is not a martyr; he is just amurderer.Time is passing.  Yet, for the United States of America, there will be no forgetting Septemberthe 11th.  We will remember every rescuer who died in honor.  We will remember every familythat lives in grief.  We will remember the fire and ash, the last phone calls, the funerals of thechildren.And the people of my country will remember those who have plotted against us.  We arelearning their names.  We are coming to know their faces.  There is no corner of the Earthdistant or dark enough to protect them.  However long it takes, their hour of justice will come.Every nation has a stake in this cause.  As we meet, the terrorists are planning more murder -- perhaps in my country, or perhaps in yours. They kill because they aspire todominate.  They seek to overthrow governments and destabilize entire regions.Last week, anticipating this meeting of the General Assembly, they denounced the UnitedNations.  They called our Secretary General a criminal and condemned all Arab nations hereas traitors to Islam.Few countries meet their exacting standards of brutality and oppression.  Every other countryis a potential target.  And all the world faces the most horrifying prospect of all:  These sameterrorists are searching for weapons of mass destruction, the tools to turn their hatred intoholocaust.  They can be expected to use chemical, biological and nuclear weapons themoment they are capable of doing so.  No hint of conscience would prevent it.This threat cannot be ignored.  This threat cannot be appeased. Civilization, itself, thecivilization we share, is threatened.  History will record our response, and judge or justifyevery nation in this hall.The civilized world is now responding.  We act to defend ourselves and deliver our childrenfrom a future of fear.  We choose the dignity of life over a culture of death.  We choose lawfulchange and civil disagreement over coercion, subversion, and chaos.  These commitments --hope and order, law and life -- unite people across cultures and continents.  Upon thesecommitments depend all peace and progress.  For these commitments, we are determined tofight.The United Nations has risen to this responsibility.  On the 12th of September, these buildingsopened for emergency meetings of the General Assembly and the Security Council.  Beforethe sun had set, these attacks on the world stood condemned by the world.  And I want tothank you for this strong and principled stand.I also thank the Arab Islamic countries that have condemned terrorist murder.  Many of youhave seen the destruction of terror in your own lands. The terrorists are increasingly isolatedby their own hatred and extremism. They cannot hide behind Islam.  The authors of massmurder and their allies have no place in any culture, and no home in any faith.The conspiracies of terror are being answered by an expanding global coalition.  Not everynation will be a part of every action against the enemy.  But every nation in our coalition hasduties.  These duties can be demanding, as we in America are learning.  We have already made adjustments in our laws and in our daily lives.  We're taking new measures toinvestigate terror and to protect against threats.The leaders of all nations must now carefully consider their responsibilities and theirfuture.  Terrorist groups like al Qaeda depend upon the aid or indifference ofgovernments.  They need the support of a financial infrastructure, and safe havens to trainand plan and hide.Some nations want to play their part in the fight against terror, but tell us they lack themeans to enforce their laws and control their borders.  We stand ready to help.  Somegovernments still turn a blind eye to the terrorists, hoping the threat will pass them by.  Theyare mistaken. And some governments, while pledging to uphold the principles of the U.N.,have cast their lot with the terrorists.  They support them and harbor them, and they will findthat their welcome guests are parasites that will weaken them, and eventually consume them.For every regime that sponsors terror, there is a price to be paid. And it will be paid.  Theallies of terror are equally guilty of murder and equally accountable to justice.The Taliban are now learning this lesson -- that regime and the terrorists who support it arenow virtually indistinguishable.  Together they promote terror abroad and impose a reign ofterror on the Afghan people.  Women are executed in Kabal's soccer stadium.  They can bebeaten for wearing socks that are too thin.  Men are jailed for missing prayer meetings.The United States, supported by many nations, is bringing justice to the terrorists inAfghanistan.  We're making progress against military targets, and that is our objective.  Unlikethe enemy, we seek to minimize, not maximize, the loss of innocent life.I'm proud of the honorable conduct of the American military.  And my country grieves for allthe suffering the Taliban have brought upon Afghanistan, including the terrible burden ofwar.  The Afghan people do not deserve their present rulers.  Years of Taliban misrule havebrought nothing but misery and starvation.Even before this current crisis, 4 million Afghans depended on food from the United Statesand other nations, and millions of Afghans were refugees from Taliban oppression.I make this promise to all the victims of that regime:  The Taliban's days of harboringterrorists and dealing in heroin and brutalizing women are drawing to a close.  And when thatregime is gone, the people of Afghanistan will say with the rest of the world: good riddance.I can promise, too, that America will join the world in helping the people of Afghanistanrebuild their country.  Many nations, including mine, are sending food and medicine to helpAfghans through the winter.  America has air-dropped over 1.3 million packages of rationsinto Afghanistan. Just this week, we air-lifted 20,000 blankets and over 200 tons of provisionsinto the region.  We continue to provide humanitarian aid, even while the Taliban tried to stealthe food we send.More help eventually will be needed.  The United States will work closely with the UnitedNations and development banks to reconstruct Afghanistan after hostilities there have ceasedand the Taliban are no longer in control.  And the United States will work with the U.N. tosupport a post-Taliban government that represents all of the Afghan people.In this war of terror, each of us must answer for what we have done or what we have leftundone.  After tragedy, there is a time for sympathy and condolence.  And my country hasbeen very grateful for both.  The memorials and vigils around the world will not beforgotten.  But the time for sympathy has now passed; the time for action has now arrived.The most basic obligations in this new conflict have already been defined by the UnitedNations.  On September the 28th, the Security Council adopted Resolution 1373.  Itsrequirements are clear:  Every United Nations member has a responsibility to crack down onterrorist financing.  We must pass all necessary laws in our own countries to allow theconfiscation of terrorist assets.  We must apply those laws to every financial institution inevery nation.We have a responsibility to share intelligence and coordinate the efforts of lawenforcement.  If you know something, tell us.  If we know something, we'll tell you.  Andwhen we find the terrorists, we must work together to bring them to justice.  We have aresponsibility to deny any sanctuary, safe haven or transit to terrorists.Every known terrorist camp must be shut down, its operators apprehended, and evidence oftheir arrest presented to the United Nations.  We have a responsibility to deny weapons toterrorists and to actively prevent private citizens from providing them.These obligations are urgent and they are binding on every nation with a place in thischamber.  Many governments are taking these obligations seriously, and my countryappreciates it.  Yet, even beyond Resolution 1373, more is required, and more is expected ofour coalition against terror.We're asking for a comprehensive commitment to this fight.  We must unite in opposing allterrorists, not just some of them.  In this world there are good causes and bad causes, andwe may disagree on where the line is drawn.  Yet, there is no such thing as a goodterrorist.  No national aspiration, no remembered wrong can ever justify the deliberate murderof the innocent.  Any government that rejects this principle, trying to pick and choose itsterrorist friends, will know the consequences.We must speak the truth about terror.  Let us never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theoriesconcerning the attacks of September the 11th; malicious lies that attempt to shift the blameaway from the terrorists, themselves, away from the guilty.  To inflame ethnic hatred is toadvance the cause of terror.The war against terror must not serve as an excuse to persecute ethnic and religiousminorities in any country. Innocent people must be allowed to live their own lives, by theirown customs, under their own religion. And every nation must have avenues for the peacefulexpression of opinion and dissent. When these avenues are closed, the temptation to speakthrough violence grows.We must press on with our agenda for peace and prosperity in every land.  My country ispledged to encouraging development and expanding trade.  My country is pledged to investingin education and combating AIDS and other infectious diseases around the world.  FollowingSeptember 11th, these pledges are even more important.  In our struggle against hatefulgroups that exploit poverty and despair, we must offer an alternative of opportunity and hope.The American government also stands by its commitment to a just peace in the MiddleEast.  We are working toward a day when two states, Israel and Palestine, live peacefullytogether within secure and recognize borders as called for by the Security Councilresolutions.  We will do all in our power to bring both parties back into negotiations.  Butpeace will only come when all have sworn off, forever, incitement, violence and terror.And, finally, this struggle is a defining moment for the United Nations, itself.  And the worldneeds its principled leadership.  It undermines the credibility of this great institution, forexample, when the Commission on Human Rights offers seats to the world's most persistentThe steps I described will not be easy.  For all nations, they will require effort.  For somenations, they will require great courage.  Yet, the cost of inaction is far greater.  The onlyalternative to victory is a nightmare world where every city is a potential killing field.As I've told the American people, freedom and fear are at war.  We face enemies that hate notour policies, but our existence; the tolerance of openness and creative culture that definesus.  But the outcome of this conflict is certain:  There is a current in history and it runs towardfreedom.  Our enemies resent it and dismiss it, but the dreams of mankind are defined byliberty -- the natural right to create and build and worship and live in dignity.  When men andwomen are released from oppression and isolation, they find fulfillment and hope, and theyleave poverty by the millions.These aspirations are lifting up the peoples of Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas, and theycan lift up all of the Islamic world.We stand for the permanent hopes of humanity, and those hopes will not be denied.  We'reconfident, too, that history has an author who fills time and eternity with his purpose.  Weknow that evil is real, but good will prevail against it.  This is the  teaching of many faiths, andin that assurance we gain strength for a long journey.It is our task -- the task of this generation -- to provide the response to aggression andterror.  We have no other choice, because there is no other peace.We did not ask for this mission, yet there is honor in history's call. We have a chance to writethe story of our times, a story of courage defeating cruelty and light overcomingdarkness.  This calling is worthy of any life, and worthy of every nation.  So let us go forward,confident, determined, and unafraid. Thank you very much.",bush
"Thank you, all. Chief Justice Rehnquist, President Carter, President Bush, President Clinton, distinguishedguests and my fellow citizens:The peaceful transfer of authority is rare in history, yet common in our country. With a simpleoath, we affirm old traditions and make new beginnings.As I begin, I thank President Clinton for his service to our nation.And I thank Vice President Gore for a contest conducted with spirit and ended with grace.I am honored and humbled to stand here, where so many of America's leaders have comebefore me, and so many will follow.We have a place, all of us, in a long story -- a story we continue, but whose end we will notsee. It is a story of a new world that became a friend and liberator of the old, a story of aslave-holding society that became a servant of freedom, the story of a power that went intothe world to protect but not possess, to defend but not to conquer.It is the American story -- a story of flawed and fallible people, united across the generationsby grand and enduring ideals. The grandest of these ideals is an unfolding American promisethat everyone belongs, that everyone deserves a chance, that no insignificant person wasever born. Americans are called to enact this promise in our lives and in our laws. And thoughour nation has sometimes halted, and sometimes delayed, we must follow no other course.Through much of the last century, America's faith in freedom and democracy was a rock in araging sea. Now it is a seed upon the wind, taking root in many nations. Our democratic faithis more than the creed of our country, it is the inborn hope of our humanity, an ideal we carrybut do not own, a trust we bear and pass along. And even after nearly 225 years, we have along way yet to travel.While many of our citizens prosper, others doubt the promise, even the justice, of our owncountry. The ambitions of some Americans are limited by failing schools and hidden prejudiceand the circumstances of their birth. And sometimes our differences run so deep, it seems weshare a continent, but not a country. We do not accept this, and we will not allow it. Ourunity, our union, is the serious work of leaders and citizens in every generation.And this is my solemn pledge: I will work to build a single nation of justice and opportunity.I know this is in our reach because we are guided by a Power larger than ourselves whocreates us equal in His image.And we are confident in principles that unite and lead us onward. America has never beenunited by blood or birth or soil. We are bound by ideals that move us beyond ourbackgrounds, lift us above our interests and teach us what it means to be citizens. Every childmust be taught these principles. Every citizen must uphold them. And every immigrant, byembracing these ideals, makes our country more, not less, American.Today -- Today we affirm a new commitment to live out our nation's promise through civility,courage, compassion, and character. America, at its best, matches a commitment to principlewith a concern for civility. A civil society demands from each of us good will and respect, fairdealing and forgiveness.Some seem to believe that our politics can afford to be petty because, in a time of peace, thestakes of our debates appear small. But the stakes for America are never small. If our countrydoes not lead the cause of freedom, it will not be led. If we do not turn the hearts of childrentoward knowledge and character, we will lose their gifts and undermine their idealism. If wepermit our economy to drift and decline, the vulnerable will suffer most.We must live up to the calling we share. Civility is not a tactic or a sentiment. It is thedetermined choice of trust over cynicism, of community over chaos. And this commitment, ifwe keep it, is a way to shared accomplishment.America, at its best, is also courageous. Our national courage has been clear in times ofdepression and war, when defeating common dangers defined our common good. Now wemust choose if the example of our fathers and mothers will inspire us or condemn us. Wemust show courage in a time of blessing by confronting problems instead of passing them onto future generations.Together, we will reclaim America's schools, before ignorance and apathy claim more younglives. We will reform Social Security and Medicare, sparing our children from struggles wehave the power to prevent. And we'll reduce taxes, to recover the momentum of our economyand reward the effort and enterprise of working Americans. We will build our defenses beyondchallenge, lest weakness invite challenge. We will confront weapons of mass destruction, sothat a new century is spared new horrors.The enemies of liberty and our country should make no mistake: America remains engaged inthe world by history and by choice, shaping a balance of power that favors freedom. We willdefend our allies and our interests. We will show purpose without arrogance. We will meetaggression and bad faith with resolve and strength. And to all nations, we will speak for thevalues that gave our nation birth.America, at its best, is compassionate. In the quiet of American conscience, we know thatdeep, persistent poverty is unworthy of our nation's promise. And whatever our views of itscause, we can agree that children at risk are not at fault. Abandonment and abuse are notacts of God, they are failures of love. And the proliferation of prisons, however necessary, isno substitute for hope and order in our souls. Where there is suffering, there is duty.Americans in need are not strangers, they are citizens, not problems, but priorities. And all ofus are diminished when any are hopeless.Government has great responsibilities for public safety and public health, for civil rights andcommon schools. Yet compassion is the work of a nation, not just a government. And someneeds and hurts are so deep they will only respond to a mentor's touch or a pastor's prayer.Church and charity, synagogue and mosque lend our communities their humanity, and theywill have an honored place in our plans and in our laws.Many in our country do not know the pain of poverty, but we can listen to those who do. And Ican pledge our nation to a goal: When we see that wounded traveler on the road to Jericho,we will not pass to the other side.America, at its best, is a place where personal responsibility is valued and expected.Encouraging responsibility is not a search for scapegoats, it is a call to conscience. And thoughit requires sacrifice, it brings a deeper fulfillment. We find the fullness of life not only inoptions, but in commitments. And we find that children and community are the commitmentsthat set us free.Our public interest depends on private character, on civic duty and family bonds and basicfairness, on -- on uncounted, unhonored acts of decency which give direction to our freedom.Sometimes in life we're called to do great things. But as a saint of our times has said, everyday we are called to ""do small things with great love."" The most important tasks of ademocracy are done by everyone.I will live and lead by these principles: to advance my convictions with civility, to pursue thepublic interest with courage, to speak for greater justice and compassion, to call forresponsibility and try to live it as well. In all these ways, I will bring the values of our historyto the care of our times.What you do is as important as anything government does. I ask you to seek a common goodbeyond your comfort; to defend needed reforms against easy attacks; to serve your nation,beginning with your neighbor. I ask you to be citizens: citizens, not spectators; citizens, notsubjects; responsible citizens, building communities of service and a nation of character.Americans are generous and strong and decent, not because we believe in ourselves, butbecause we hold beliefs beyond ourselves. When this spirit of citizenship is missing, nogovernment program can replace it. When this spirit is present, no wrong can stand against it.Much time has passed since Jefferson arrived for his inauguration. The years and changesaccumulate. But the themes of this day he would know: our nation's grand story of courageand its simple dream of dignity.We are not this story's Author, who fills time and eternity with His purpose. Yet His purpose isachieved in our duty, and our duty is fulfilled in service to one another.Never tiring, never yielding, never finishing, we renew that purpose today, to make ourcountry more just and generous, to affirm the dignity of our lives and every life.This work continues. The story goes on. And an angel still rides in the whirlwind and directsthis storm.God bless you all, and God bless America.",bush
"I'm glad to be back here at the Citadel.   I have come to talk about the future security of our country, in a place where I took up thissubject two years ago when I was candidate for President.  In September 1999, I said here atthe Citadel that America was entering a period of consequences that would be defined by thethreat of terror, and that we faced a challenge of military transformation.  That threat has nowrevealed itself, and that challenge is now the military and moral necessity of our time. So,today, I will set forth the commitments essential to victory in our war against terror.I want to thank Major General John Grinalds for his hospitality.  I want to thank the CitadelBoard of Visitors, the staff, and the faculty.  I understand the Governor is here.  And I knowmy friends, the Lt. Governor, the Speaker and the Attorney General are here, and it was greatto have seen them at the airport.  I thank my friend, Adjutant General Stan Spears for beinghere.I'm grateful that Senator Hollings and members of the South Carolina congressionaldelegation flew down on Air Force One.  I only wish that the senior Senator was on theairplane so I could have wished him a happy 99th birthday.But most of all, most of all, I want to say how much I appreciate being in the presence ofsome of America's finest, the South Carolina Corp of Cadets of Citadel.Four days ago, I joined the men and women of the USS Enterprise to mark the 60thanniversary of Pearl Harbor.  December 7th, 1941 was a decisive day that changed our nationforever.  In a single moment, America's ""splendid isolation"" was ended.  And the four yearsthat followed transformed the American way of war.The age of battleships gave way to the offensive capability of aircraft carriers.  The tank, onceused only to protect infantry, now served to cut through enemy lines.  At Guadalcanal, andNormandy, and Iwo Jima, amphibious warfare proved its worth.  And by war's end, no onewould ever again doubt the value of strategic air power.Even more importantly, an American President and his successors shaped a world beyond awar.  They rebuilt Europe with the Marshall Plan, formed a great alliance for freedom in NATO,and expressed the hope of collective security in the United Nations.  America took the lead,becoming freedom's defender and assuming responsibilities that only we could bear.September 11th, 2001 -- three months and a long time ago -- set another dividing line in ourlives and in the life of our nation.  An illusion of immunity was shattered.  A faraway evilbecame a present danger.  And a great cause became clear:  We will fight terror and thosewho sponsor it, to save our children from a future of fear.To win this war, we have to think differently.  The enemy who appeared on September 11thseeks to evade our strength and constantly searches for our weaknesses.  So America isrequired once again to change the way our military thinks and fights.  And starting on October7th, the enemy in Afghanistan got the first glimpses of a new American military that cannot,and will not, be evaded.When I committed U.S. forces to this battle, I had every confidence that they would be up tothe task.  And they have proven me right.  The Taliban and the terrorists set out to dominatea country and intimidate the world.  Today, from their caves, it's all looking a littledifferent.  And no cave is deep enough to escape the patient justice of the United States ofAmerica.We are also beginning to see the possibilities of a world beyond the war on terror.  We have achance, if we take it, to write a hopeful chapter in human history.  All at once, a new threat tocivilization is erasing old lines of rivalry and resentment between nations.  Russia and Americaare building a new cooperative relationship.  India and the United States are increasinglyaligned across a range of issues, even as we work closely with Pakistan.  Germany and Japanare assuming new military roles, appropriate to their status as great democracies.The vast majority of countries are now on the same side of a moral and ideologicaldivide.  We're making common cause with every nation that chooses lawful change overchaotic violence -- every nation that values peace and safety and innocent life.Staring across this divide are bands of murderers, supported by outlaw regimes.  They are amovement defined by their hatreds.  They hate progress, and freedom, and choice, andculture, and music, and laughter, and women, and Christians, and Jews, and all Muslims whoreject their distorted doctrines.  They love only one thing -- they love power.  And when theyhave it, they use it without mercy.The great threat to civilization is not that the terrorists will inspire millions.  Only the terroriststhemselves would want to live in their brutal and joyless world.  The great threat to civilizationis that a few evil men will multiply their murders, and gain the means to kill on a scale equalto their hatred.  We know they have this mad intent, and we're determined to stop them.Our lives, our way of life, and our every hope for the world depend on a singlecommitment:  The authors of mass murder must be defeated, and never allowed to gain oruse the weapons of mass destruction.America and our friends will meet this threat with every method at our disposal.  We willdiscover and destroy sleeper cells.  We will track terrorist movements, trace theircommunications, disrupt their funding, and take their network apart, piece by piece.Above all, we're acting to end the state sponsorship of terror.  Rogue states are clearly themost likely sources of chemical and biological and nuclear weapons for terrorists.  Everynation now knows that we cannot accept -- and we will not accept -- states that harbor,finance, train, or equip the agents of terror.  Those nations that violate this principle will beregarded as hostile regimes.  They have been warned, they are being watched, and they willbe held to account.Preventing mass terror will be the responsibilities of Presidents far into the future.  And thisobligation sets three urgent and enduring priorities for America.  The first priority is to speedthe transformation of our military.When the Cold War ended, some predicted that the era of direct threats to our nation wasover.  Some thought our military would be used overseas -- not to win wars, but mainly topolice and pacify, to control crowds and contain ethnic conflict.  They were wrong.While the threats to America have changed, the need for victory has not.  We are fightingshadowy, entrenched enemies -- enemies using the tools of terror and guerrilla war -- yet weare finding new tactics and new weapons to attack and defeat them.  This revolution in ourmilitary is only beginning, and it promises to change the face of battle.Afghanistan has been a proving ground for this new approach.  These past two months haveshown that an innovative doctrine and high-tech weaponry can shape and then dominate anunconventional conflict.  The brave men and women of our military are rewriting the rules ofwar with new technologies and old values like courage and honor.  And they have made thisnation proud.Our commanders are gaining a real-time picture of the entire battlefield, and are able to gettargeting information from sensor to shooter almost instantly.  Our intelligence professionalsand special forces have cooperated in battle-friendly -- with battle-friendly Afghan forces --fighters who know the terrain, who know the Taliban, and who understand the localculture.  And our special forces have the technology to call in precision air strikes -- along withthe flexibility to direct those strikes from horseback, in the first cavalry charge of the 21stcentury.This combination -- real-time intelligence, local allied forces, special forces, and precision airpower -- has really never been used before.  The conflict in Afghanistan has taught us moreabout the future of our military than a decade of blue ribbon panels and think-tanksymposiums.The Predator is a good example.  This unmanned aerial vehicle is able to circle over enemyforces, gather intelligence, transmit information instantly back to commanders, then fire ontargets with extreme accuracy.Before the war, the Predator had skeptics, because it did not fit the old ways.  Now it is clearthe military does not have enough unmanned vehicles.  We're entering an era in whichunmanned vehicles of all kinds will take on greater importance -- in space, on land, in the air,and at sea.Precision-guided munitions also offer great promise.  In the Gulf War, these weapons were theexception -- while in Afghanistan, they have been the majority of the munitions we haveused.  We're striking with greater effectiveness, at greater range, with fewer civiliancasualties.  More and more, our weapons can hit moving targets.  When all of our military cancontinuously locate and track moving targets -- with surveillance from air and space --warfare will be truly revolutionized.The need for military transformation was clear before the conflict in Afghanistan, and beforeSeptember the 11th.  Here at the Citadel in 1999, I spoke of keeping the peace by redefiningwar on our terms.  The same recommendation was made in the strategic review thatSecretary Rumsfeld briefed me on last August -- a review that I fully endorse.  What'sdifferent today is our sense of urgency -- the need to build this future force while fighting apresent war.  It's like overhauling an engine while you're going at 80 miles an hour.  Yet wehave no other choice.Our military has a new and essential mission.  For states that support terror, it's not enoughthat the consequences be costly -- they must be devastating.  The more credible this reality,the more likely that regimes will change their behavior -- making it less likely that Americaand our friends will need to use overwhelming force against them.To build our future force, the Armed Services must continue to attract America's best people,with good pay and good living conditions.  Our military culture must reward new thinking,innovation, and experimentation.  Congress must give defense leaders the freedom toinnovate, instead of micromanaging the Defense Department.  And every service and everyconstituency of our military must be willing to sacrifice some of their own pet projects.  Ourwar on terror cannot be used to justify obsolete bases, obsolete programs, or obsoleteweapon systems.  Every dollar of defense spending must meet a single test:  It must help usbuild the decisive power we will need to win the wars of the future.Our country is united in supporting a great cause -- and in supporting those who fight forit.  We will give our men and women in uniform every resource, every weapon, every toolthey need to win the long battle that lies ahead.America's next priority to prevent mass terror is to protect against the proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them.  I wish I could report to theAmerican people that this threat does not exist -- that our enemy is content with car bombsand box cutters -- but I cannot.One former al Qaeda member has testified in court that he was involved in an effort 10 yearsago to obtain nuclear materials.  And the leader of al Qaeda calls that effort ""a religiousduty.""  Abandoned al Qaeda houses in Kabul contained diagrams for crude weapons of massdestruction.  And as we all know, terrorists have put anthrax into the U.S. mail, and usedsarin gas in a Tokyo subway.And almost every state that actively sponsors terror is known to be seeking weapons of massdestruction and the missiles to deliver them at longer and longer ranges.  Their hope is toblackmail the United States into abandoning our war on terror, and forsaking our friends andallies and security commitments around the world.  Our enemies are bound fordisappointment.  America will never be blackmailed, and we will never forsake ourcommitment to liberty.To meet our new threats, I have directed my National Security Advisor and my HomelandSecurity Director to develop a comprehensive strategy on proliferation.  Working with othercountries, we will strengthen nonproliferation treaties and toughen export controls.Together, we must keep the world's most dangerous technologies out of the hands of theworld's most dangerous people.A crucial partner in this effort is Russia -- a nation we are helping to dismantle strategicweapons, reduce nuclear material, and increase security at nuclear sites.  Our two countrieswill expand efforts to provide peaceful employment for scientists who formerly worked inSoviet weapons facilities.  The United States will also work with Russia to build a facility todestroy tons of nerve agent.  I'll request an over-all increase in funding to support this vitalmission.Even as we fight to prevent proliferation, we must prepare for every possibility.  At home, wemust be better prepared to detect, protect against, and respond to the potential use ofweapons of mass destruction.  Abroad, our military forces must have the ability to fight andwin against enemies who would use such weapons against us.Biodefense has become a major initiative of ours.  This year we've already requested nearly$3 billion additional dollars for biodefense, more than doubling the level of funding prior toSeptember the 11th.The attacks on our nation made it even more clear that we need to build limited and effectivedefenses against a missile attack.  Our enemies seek every chance and every means to doharm to our country, our forces, and our friends.  And we will not permit it.Suppose the Taliban and the terrorists had been able to strike America or important allies witha ballistic missile.  Our coalition would have become fragile, the stakes in our war much, muchhigher.  We must protect Americans and our friends against all forms of terror, including theterror that could arrive on a missile.Last week we conducted another promising test of our missile defense technology.  For thegood of peace, we're moving forward with an active program to determine what works andwhat does not work.  In order to do so, we must move beyond the 1972 Anti-Ballistic MissileTreaty, a treaty that was written in a different era, for a different enemy.America and our allies must not be bound to the past.  We must be able to build the defenseswe need against the enemies of the 21st century.Our third and final priority in the fight against mass terror is to strengthen the advantage thatgood intelligence gives our country.  Every day I make decisions influenced by the intelligencebriefing of that morning.  To reach decisions, a President needs more than data andinformation.  A President needs real and current knowledge and analysis of the plans,intentions, and capabilities of our enemies.The last several months have shown that there is no substitute for good intelligence officers,people on the ground.  These are the people who find the targets, follow our enemies, andhelp us disrupt their evil plans.The United States must rebuild our network of human intelligence.  And we will apply the bestnew technology to gather intelligence on the new threats.  Sophisticated systems like GlobalHawk, an unmanned surveillance plane, are transforming our intelligence capabilities.  Ourtechnological strengths produce great advantages, and we will build on them.Our intelligence services and federal law enforcement agencies must work more closelytogether, and share timely information with our state and local authorities.  The more weknow, the more terrorist plans we can prevent and disrupt, and the better we'll be able toprotect the American people.And in all they do, our intelligence agencies must attract the best people -- the best collectors,the best analysts, the best linguists.  We will give them the training they need and thecompensation they deserve.There have been times here in America when our intelligence services were held in suspicion,and even contempt.  Now, when we face this new war, we know how much we needthem.  And for their dedication and for their service, America is grateful.We're also grateful to you, the students of the Citadel.  Your uniforms symbolize a tradition ofhonor and sacrifice, renewed in your own lives.  Many of you will enter our military -- takingyour place in the war against terror.  That struggle may continue for many years, and it maybring great costs.  But you will have chosen a great calling at a crucial hour for our nation.The course we follow is a matter of profound consequence to many nations.  If Americawavers, the world will lose heart.  If America leads, the world will show its courage.  Americawill never waver.  America will lead the world to peace.Our cause is necessary.  Our cause is just.  And no matter how long it takes, we will defeatthe enemies of freedom.In all that is to come, I know the graduates of the Citadel will bring credit to America, to themilitary, and to this great institution.  In the words of your school song, you will go whereyou've always gone -- ""in the Paths our fathers showed us...Peace and Honor, God andCountry, We will fight for thee.""God bless.",bush
"memory against forgetting. When we fight terror, we fight tyranny; and so we remember. Weremember the perfect blueness of the sky that Tuesday morning. We remember the childrentraveling without their mothers when their planes were hijacked.We remember the cruelty of the murderers and the pain and anguish of the murdered. Everyone of the innocents who died on September the 11th was the most important person onearth to somebody. Every death extinguished a world. We remember the courage of the rescue workers and the outpouring of friendship andsympathy from nations around the world. We remember how we felt that day: our sadness,the surge of love for our country, our anger, and our determination to right this huge wrong.Today, the wrong is being righted and justice is being done. We still have far to go. And manydangers lie ahead. Yet, there can be no doubt how this conflict will end. Our enemies havemade the mistake that America's enemies always make. They saw liberty and thought theysaw weakness. And now, they see defeat. In time, this war will end. But our remembrance never will. All around this beautiful city arestatues of our heroes, memorials, museums and archives that preserve our nationalexperience, our achievements and our failures, our defeats and our victories. This republic is young, but its memory is long. Now, we have inscribed a new memoryalongside those others. It's a memory of tragedy and shock, of loss and mourning. But notonly of loss and mourning. It's also a memory of bravery and self-sacrifice, and the love thatlays down its life for a friend -- even a friend whose name it never knew. We are privileged to have with us the families of many of the heroes on September the 11th,including the family of Jeremy Glick of Flight 93. His courage and self-sacrifice may havesaved the White House. It is right and fitting that it is here we pay our respects. In time, perhaps, we will mark the memory of September the 11th in stone and metal --something we can show children as yet unborn to help them understand what happened onthis minute and on this day. But for those of us who lived through these events, the only marker we'll ever need is the tickof a clock at the 46th minute of the eighth hour of the 11th day. We will remember where wewere and how we felt. We will remember the dead and what we owe them. We will rememberwhat we lost and what we found. And in our time, we will honor the memory of the 11th day by doing our duty as citizens ofthis great country, freedom's home and freedoms defender.God bless.",bush
"Okay!  I know you all are anxious to get back to class.  So please be seated.  Thank you forsuch a warm welcome.  It's great to be in the home of the Big Blue -- Hamilton High School.  Iwant to thank you all for coming.  I particularly want to thank my friend, the Governor of thegreat state of Ohio, Governor Taft, for being here.I want to thank Tracy Miller for being so hospitable.  I want to thank all who have come towitness this historic moment.  For those of you who have studied the history of ourgovernment, you know most bills are signed at the White House.  But I decided to sign thisbill in one of the most important places in America -- a public school.We've got large challenges here in America.  There's no greater challenge than to make surethat every child -- and all of us on this stage mean every child, not just a few children -- everysingle child, regardless of where they live, how they're raised, the income level of their family,every child receive a first-class education in America.And as you know, we've got another challenge, and that's to protect America from evilones.  And I want to assure the seniors and juniors and sophomores here at Hamilton HighSchool that the effort that this great country is engaged in, the effort to defend freedom andto defend our people, the effort to rout out terror wherever it exists, is noble and just andright, and your great country will prevail in this effort.I long for peace.  But I also understand that if we do not lead the world against terror, thatyour children and your grandchildren will not grow up in a society that is as free as the societywe have today.  Freedom is the precious gift that one generation can pass to the next.  It is agift and a promise that I intend to keep to the American children.And we owe the children of America a good education.  And today begins a new era, a newtime in public education in our country.  As of this hour, America's schools will be on a newpath of reform, and a new path of results. Our schools will have higher expectations.  We believe every child can learn.  Our schools willhave greater resources to help meet those goals. Parents will have more information aboutthe schools, and more say in how their children are educated.  From this day forward, allstudents will have a better chance to learn, to excel, and to live out their dreams.I want to thank the Secretary of Education, Rod Paige, for being here and for his leadership.  Iasked Rod to join my administration because I wanted somebody who understood what itmeant to run a school district in Washington, D.C.  I didn't need somebody that based hisknowledge on theory; I wanted somebody who based his knowledge on experience.  And Rodwas a teacher, a school board member, and the Superintendent of the Houston IndependentSchool District.  He did a fine job there, and he's doing a fine job in Washington.Reaching this moment has not been easy, as you could tell from Chairman Boehner'sdiscussion.  But we made it, because of the willingness of four fine leaders to do what wasright for America.  We made it because proud members of the House and the Senate, loyal totheir parties, decided to set partisan politics aside and focus on what was right for America.I want to thank George Miller.  I call him Big George, Jorge el Grande.  As John mentioned,George and I aren't from the same political ideology -- except when I met with George inAustin, I could tell he shares the same passion I share for making sure that every child getseducated.  And he, like me and others, realize that a system that simply shuffles childrenthrough the schools is a system that's going to leave people behind.  And so we made up ourminds right then and there to do something about it. I appreciate so very much my friend, Judd Gregg, from the state of New Hampshire, beinghere.  He was my campaign manager in the New Hampshire primary.  I still invited him tocome with me.  After here, we're going to New Hampshire.  I look forward to singing Judd'spraises because he is a solid, solid United States senator -- honest, full of integrity, and likethe others here, he buckled down to do what was right for the children. And then, of course, there's Senator Edward Kennedy.  And the folks at the Crawford CoffeeShop -- would be somewhat shocked when I told them I actually like the fellow.  He is afabulous United States senator.  When he's against you, it's tough.  When he's with you, it is agreat experience.And I'm signing this bill here because it's the home of the Chairman, John Boehner.  John dida really good job.  He shepherded the process.  He made sure people showed up for themeetings.  He was dogged in his determination to get this bill done.  It would not havehappened without his leadership.  And all four of these members up here need to be proud ofthe legacy they have left behind.  This is a good bill for the American children, and I'm proudto sign it in their presence.There are other members of the Congress who are here, as well, and I want to thank them forcoming.  Senator Evan Bayh from the state of Indiana, is here.  Evan, thank you for yourleadership on education reform. Senator Mike DeWine of your state of Ohio, who helpedauthor -- who helped to author the safe and drug-free schools part of this bill.  Thank you foryour leadership. Steve Chabot of Ohio, Van Hilleary of Tennessee -- thank you both for coming, as well.  Inthat box is the bill.  I don't intend to read it all.  It's not exactly light reading.  But if you wereto read it all, you would find that it contains some very important principles that will helpguide our public school system for the next decades. First principle is accountability.  Every school has a job to do.  And that's to teach the basicsand teach them well.  If we want to make sure no child is left behind, every child must learnto read.  And every child must learn to add and subtract.  So in return for federal dollars, weare asking states to design accountability systems to show parents and teachers whether ornot children can read and write and add and subtract in grades three through eight. The fundamental principle of this bill is that every child can learn, we expect every child tolearn, and you must show us whether or not every child is learning.  I read a quote one timefrom a young lady in New York.  She said, ""I don't ever remember taking an exam.  They justkept passing me along.  I ended up dropping out in the 7th grade.  I basically felt nobodycared."" The story of children being just shuffled through the system is one of the saddest stories ofAmerica.  Let's just move them through.  It's so much easier to move a child through thantrying to figure out how to solve a child's problems.  The first step to making sure that a childis not shuffled through is to test that child as to whether or not he or she can read and write,or add and subtract. The first way to solve a problem is to diagnose it.  And so, what this bill says, it says everychild can learn.  And we want to know early, before it's too late, whether or not a child has aproblem in learning.  I understand taking tests aren't fun.  Too bad.  We need to know inAmerica.  We need to know whether or not children have got the basic education.No longer is it acceptable to hide poor performance.  No longer is it acceptable to keep resultsaway from parents.  One of the interesting things about this bill, it says that we're never goingto give up on a school that's performing poorly; that when we find poor performance, a schoolwill be given time and incentives and resources to correct their problems.  A school will begiven time to try other methodologies, perhaps other leadership, to make sure that peoplecan succeed.  If, however, schools don't perform, if, however, given the new resources,focused resources, they are unable to solve the problem of not educating their children, theremust be real consequences.  There must be a moment in which parents can say, I've hadenough of this school.  Parents must be given real options in the face of failure in order tomake sure reform is meaningful. And so, therefore, this bill's second principle is, is that we trust parents to make the rightdecisions for their children.  Any school that doesn't perform, any school that cannot catch upand do its job, a parent will have these options -- a better public school, a tutor, or a charterschool.  We do not want children trapped in schools that will not change and will not teach.The third principle of this bill is that we have got to trust the local folks on how to achievestandards, to meet the standards.  In Washington, there's some smart people there, but thepeople who care most about the children in Hamilton are the citizens of Hamilton.  The peoplewho care most about the children in this school are the teachers and parents and school boardmembers. And therefore, schools not only have the responsibility to improve, they now havethe freedom to improve. The federal government will not micromanage how schools are run.  We believe strongly -- webelieve strongly the best path to education reform is to trust the local people.  And so the newrole of the federal government is to set high standards, provide resources, hold peopleaccountable, and liberate school districts to meet the standards.I can't think of any better way to say to teachers, we trust you. And, first of all, we've got tothank all the teachers who are here.  I thank you for teaching. Yours is indeed a nobleprofession. And our society is better off because you decided to teach.  And by saying we trustlocal folks, we're really saying we trust you.  We trust you.  We want you to have as muchflexibility as possible to see to it that every child that walks in your classroom cansucceed.  So thank you for what you do.And a fourth principle is that we're going to spend more money, more resources, but they'll bedirected at methods that work.  Not feel-good methods, not sound-good methods, butmethods that actually work. Particularly when it comes to reading.  We're going to spendmore on our schools, and we're going to spend it more wisely. If we've learned anything over the last generations, money alone doesn't make a goodschool.  It certainly helps.  But as John mentioned, we've spent billions of dollars with lousyresults.  So now it's time to spend billions of dollars and get good results.As John mentioned, too many of our kids can't read.  You know, a huge percentage of childrenin poverty can't read at grade level.  That's not right in America.  We're going to win the waroverseas, and we need to win the war against illiteracy here at home, as well.  And so this bill-- so this bill focuses on reading.  It sets a grand goal for the country.  Our children will bereading by the third grade. That's not an impossible goal.  It's a goal we must meet if we want every child tosucceed.  And so, therefore, we tripled the amount of federal funding for scientifically-basedearly reading programs.  We've got money in there to make sure teachers know how to teachwhat works.  We've got money in there to help promote proven methods of instruction. There are no more excuses, as far as I'm concerned, about not teaching children how toread.  We know what works.  The money is now available, and it's up to each local district tomake sure it happens.  It's up to you, the citizens of Hamilton, to make sure no child is leftbehind.  And the federal government can spend money and we can help set standards, and wecan assist upon accountability.  But the truth of the matter is our schools will flourish whencitizens join in the noble cause of making sure no child is left behind. This is the end of a legislative process.  Signing this bill is the end of a long, long time ofpeople sitting in rooms trying to hammer out differences.  It's a great symbol of what ispossible in Washington when good people come together to do what's right.  But it's just thebeginning of change.  And now it's up to you, the local citizens of our great land, thecompassionate, decent citizens of America, to stand up and demand high standards, and todemand that no child -- not one single child in America -- is left behind. Thank you for letting us come.  May God bless.",bush

"Well, thank you very much for that warm welcome. I am so grateful for the CommonwealthClub and the Churchill Club for inviting me here. I appreciate you all coming, and I appreciateyour hospitality. I want to thank Dr. Gloria Duffy for her generous introduction and for her invitation. I want tothank Silvia Fernandez, who's the President of the Churchill Club, for joining theCommonwealth Club to host this event. I want to thank all the elected officials who are here. Iwant to thank my fellow citizens for coming.Whenever I visit California, I'm impressed by the beauty of this state and by the spirit of thepeople. Because of its size, the health of the California economy influences every American.And California has got a culture of optimism and energy that touches all of us, as well. This isa vital and a vibrant place. And I'm glad to be back.The last time I visited San Jose, Silicon Valley was still in an economic boom, and Americawas at peace. For many in this valley, and across our country, those times are a world away.After a recession made worse by a national emergency, we have seen some good news. Oureconomy is beginning to grow. Just last week, we had the good news about strong growth inthe first quarter. Yet this vital region reminds us that a lot of work remains to be done. Business investment and job creation are not what they should be. We cannot be content withone quarter's news. We cannot be complacent. My attitude is that we'll let the statisticianstalk about the numbers. But so long as somebody who wants to work can't find work, that's aproblem for America. We have a great task ahead of us. We must turn our short-term recovery into long-lastingexpansion that reaches every part of our country. Our economy grows when trade barriersfall. I ask the Senate to join the United States House of Representatives in giving me what'scalled trade promotion authority. It's important to be a confident country. And I'm confident in the ability of Americanentrepreneurs and producers to compete in the world. I'm confident that our farmers andranchers can compete in the world. And I know American technology companies are the bestin the world. And we must open new markets so they can sell to the world. Our economy grows when the tax burden goes down, and stays down. Much of the growth wehave seen this quarter is the result of consumer spending, fueled by well-timed taxdeductions. (Laughter.) To encourage growth in job creation, we must protect the lower taxrates we've enacted, and we must make them permanent. And to make sure there iseconomic vitality around our country, our government must control its appetite for excessivespending. Our economy grows entrepreneurs are rewarded for their success, not hounded by regulationsand needless litigation. We must enact reforms that free entrepreneurs from pointlessregulation and endless litigation, and to restore trust in our economy. Corporate leaders mustbe held to the highest ethical standards. And, as your state knows, our economy grows whenwe have steady, stable and affordable sources of energy.In Washington, we must adopt -- finally adopt -- a comprehensive strategy to conserve more,to produce more, and to deliver the energy that keeps our economy running. Both Houseshave passed an energy -- passed energy legislation. I expect them to get a bill to my desksoon for the good of American economy and American jobs. By acting in the above way, weconfirm that the role of government is not to create wealth; the role of government is tocreate the conditions for economic growth. Since I was last here, America has also accepted a great challenge in the world: to wage arelentless and systematic campaign against global terror. The security of the American peopleis the central commitment of the American government. We are in for a long and difficult war.It will be conducted on many fronts. But as long as it takes, we will prevail. In the first phase of our military operation, American and coalition forces have liberated --have liberated -- the people of Afghanistan from a barbaric regime. Our Armed Forcesperformed with skill and success and honor. A regime has fallen. Terrorists in that country arenow scattered, and the children of Afghanistan have returned to school, boys and girls. Ourwork in that country is not over. We are helping the Afghan people to rebuild their nation. Andin every cave, in every dark corner of that country, we will hunt down the killers and bringthem to justice. We have entered the next phase of the war, with a sustained international effort, to rout outterrorists in other countries, and deny al Qaeda the chance to regroup in other places. Acrossthe world, governments have heard this message: You're either with us, or you're with theterrorists. And for the long-term security of America and civilization itself, we must confront the greatthreat of biological and chemical and nuclear weapons in the hands of terrorists or hostileregimes. We will not allow the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten America or ourfriends and allies with the world's most destructive weapons. History has called us to these responsibilities, and we accept them. America has always had aspecial mission to defend justice and advance freedom around the world. Whatever thedifficulties ahead, we are confident about the outcome of this struggle. Tyranny and terror andlawless violence will not decide the world's future. As Ronald Reagan said. and as everygeneration of Americans has believed, the future belongs to the free.In a time of war, we reassert the essential values and beliefs of our country. In the Civil War,Abraham Lincoln pointed toward a new birth of freedom. Leading America into global war,Franklin D. Roosevelt defined the four freedoms: freedom of speech and religion, freedomfrom fear and want. Whenever America fights for the security of our country, we also fight forthe values of our country. In our time, we will defend the land we love and we will act on theideals that gave it birth. In America, we've not always lived up to our ideals, yet we always reached for them. Webelieve that everyone deserves a chance, that everyone has value, that no insignificant personwas ever born. We believe that all are diminished when any are hopeless. We are one people,committed to building a single nation of justice and opportunity. America rejects bigotry. We reject every act of hatred against people of Arab background orMuslim faith. We reject the ancient evil of anti-Semitism, whether it is practiced by the killersof Daniel Pearl, or by those who burn synagogues in France. America values and welcomes peaceful people of all faiths -- Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Sikh,Hindu and many others. Every faith is practiced and protected here, because we are onecountry. Every immigrant can be fully and equally American because we're one country. Raceand color should not divide us, because America is one country. These American ideals of opportunity and equality come to us across the generations. Andthey have attracted millions from across the world. Yet there are young Americans growing uphere, under this flag, who doubt the promise and justice of our country. They live inneighborhoods occupied by gangs and ruled by fear. They are entitled by law to an education,yet do not receive an education. They hear talk of opportunity and see little evidence ofopportunity around them. Every American must believe in the promise of America. And to reach this noble, necessarygoal, there is a role for government. America doesn't need more big government, and we'velearned that more money is not always the answer. If a program is failing to serve people, itmakes little difference if we spend twice as much or half as much. The measure of truecompassion is results.Yet we cannot have an indifferent government either. We are a generous and caring people.We don't believe in a sink-or-swim society. The policies of our government must heed theuniversal call of all faiths to love a neighbor as we would want to be loved ourselves. We needa different approach than either big government or indifferent government. We need agovernment that is focused, effective, and close to the people; a government that does a fewthings, and does them well. Government cannot solve every problem, but it can encourage people and communities tohelp themselves and to help one another. Often the truest kind of compassion is to helpcitizens build lives of their own. I call my philosophy and approach ""compassionateconservatism."" It is compassionate to actively help our fellow citizens in need. It isconservative to insist on responsibility and on results. And with this hopeful approach, we canmake a real difference in people's lives. Compassionate conservatism places great hope and confidence in public education. Oureconomy depends on higher and higher skills, requiring every American to have the basictools of learning. Every public school should be the path of upward mobility. Yet, sadly enough, many are the dead-end of dreams. Public schools are some of the mostimportant institutions of democracy. They take children of every background, from every partof the world, and prepare them for the obligations and opportunities of a free society. Publicschools are Americans great hope, and making them work for every child is America's greatduty. The new education reforms we have passed in Washington give the federal government a newrole in public education. Schools must meet new and high standards of performance in readingand math that will be proven on tests and posted on the Internet for parents and everyone tosee. And we're giving local schools and teachers unprecedented freedom and resources andtraining to meet these goals. It is conservative to let local communities chart their own path to excellence. It iscompassionate to insist that every child learns, so that no child is left behind. By insisting onresults, and challenging failure where we find it, we'll make an incredible difference in thelives of every child in America.Compassionate conservatism offers a new vision for fighting poverty in America. For decades,our nation has devoted enormous resources to helping the poor, with some great successes toshow for it: basic medical care for those in need, a better life for elderly Americans. However,for millions of younger Americans, welfare became a static and destructive way of life. In 1996, we began transforming welfare with time limits and job training and workrequirements. And the nation's welfare rolls have been cut by more than half. But even moreimportantly, many lives have been dramatically improved. One former welfare recipient here in California, happened to be a mother of a chronically-illchild and the victim of domestic violence, describes her experience upon leaving welfare. Shesaid, ""I feel like an adult again. I have my dignity back."" We need to continue to fully transform welfare in America. As Congress takes up welfarereform again in the coming weeks, we must strengthen the work requirements that preventdependency and despair. Millions of Americans once on welfare are finding that a job is morethan a source of income. It is a source of dignity. And by helping people find work, by helpingthem prepare for work, we practice compassion. Welfare reform must also, wherever possible, encourage the commitments of family. Notevery child has two devoted parents at home -- I understand that. And not every marriagecan, or should be saved. But the evidence shows that strong marriages are good for children. When a couple on welfare wants to break bad patterns and start or strengthen a marriage, weshould help local groups give them counseling that teaches commitment and respect. Byencouraging family, we practice compassion. In overcoming poverty and dependence, we must also promote the work of charities andcommunity groups and faith-based institutions. These organizations, such as shelters forbattered women or mentoring programs for fatherless children or drug treatment centers,inspire hope in a way that government never can. Often, they inspire life-changing faith in away that government never should.Our government should view the good Americans that work in faith-based charities aspartners, not rivals. We must provide new incentives for charitable giving and, when it comesto providing federal resources to effective programs, we should not discriminate againstprivate and religious groups. I urge the Senate to pass the faith-based initiative for the good of America. It iscompassionate to aggressively fight poverty in America. It is conservative to encourage workand community spirit and responsibility and the values that often come from faith. And withthis approach, we can change lives one soul at a time, and make a real difference in the livesof our citizens. The same principles of compassion and responsibility apply when America offers assistance toother nations. Nearly half of the world's people still live on less than $2 a day. When we helpthem, we show our values, our belief in universal human dignity. We serve our interests andgain economic partners. And by helping the developing nations of the world, we offer analternative to resentment and conflict and terror. Yet the old way of pouring vast amounts of money into development aid without any concernfor results has failed, often leaving behind misery and poverty and corruption. America'soffering a new compact for global development. Greater aid contributions from America mustbe and will be linked to greater responsibility from developing nations. I have proposed a 50-percent increase in our core development assistance over the next threebudget years. Money that will be placed in a new Millennium Challenge Account. At the end ofthis three-year period, the level of our annual development assistance will be $5 billion higherthan current levels. This is a record amount of spending. And in return for these funds, we expect nations to routout corruption, to open their markets, to respect human rights, and to adhere to the rule oflaw. And these are the keys to progress in any nation, and they will be the conditions for anynew American aid. It is compassionate to increase our international aid. It is conservative to require the hardreforms that lead to prosperity and independence. And with this approach, we'll make a realdifference in the lives of people around the world.Compassionate conservatism guides my administration in many other areas. Our health carepolicies must help low-income Americans to buy health insurance they choose, they own andthey control. Our environmental policy set high standards for stewardship, while allowing localcooperation and innovation to meet those standards. Our housing programs moved beyondrental assistance to the pride and stability of home ownership. Our reforms in Social Securitymust allow and encourage and help working Americans to build up their own asset base andachieve independence for their retirement years. All of these policies and all of these areas serve the same vision. We are using an activegovernment to promote self-government. We're encouraging individuals and communities andfamilies to take more and more responsibility for themselves, for their neighbors, for ournation. The aim of these policies is not to spend more money or spend less money; it is tospend on what works. The measure of compassion is more than good intentions, it is good results. Sympathy is notenough. We need solutions in America, and we know where solutions are found. When schoolsare teaching, when families are strong, when neighbors look after their neighbors, when ourpeople have the tools and the skills and the resources they need to improve their lives, thereis no problem that cannot be solved in America. By being involved and by taking responsibility upon ourselves, we gain something else, aswell: We contribute to the life of our country. We become more than taxpayers and occasionalvoters, we become citizens. Citizens, not spectators. Citizens who hear the call of duty, whostand up for their beliefs, who care for their families, who control their lives, and who treattheir neighbors with respect and compassion. We discover a satisfaction that is only found inservice, and we show our gratitude to America and to those who came before us. In the last seven months, we've been tested, and the struggle of our time has revealed thespirit of our people. Since September the 11th, we have been the kind of nation our foundershad in mind, a nation of strong and confident and self-governing people. And we've been thekind of nation our fathers and mothers defended in World War II; a great and diverse country,united by common dangers and by common resolve.We in our time will defend our nation, and we will deliver our nation's promise to all who seekit.

"Yesterday we remembered the innocent lives taken that terrible morning. Today we turn tothe urgent duty of protecting other lives without illusion and without fear.We've accomplished much in the last year in Afghanistan and beyond. We have much yet todo in Afghanistan and beyond. Many nations represented here have joined in the fight againstglobal terror and the people of the United States are grateful.The United Nations was born in the hope that survived a world war, the hope of a worldmoving toward justice, escaping old patterns of conflict and fear. The founding membersresolved that the peace of the world must never again be destroyed by the will andwickedness of any man.We created a United Nations Security Council so that, unlike the League of Nations, ourdeliberations would be more than talk, our resolutions would be more than wishes. Aftergenerations of deceitful dictators and broken treaties and squandered lives, we've dedicatedourselves to standards of human dignity shared by all and to a system of security defended byall.Today, these standards and this security are challenged.Our commitment to human dignity is challenged by persistent poverty and raging disease. Thesuffering is great. And our responsibilities are clear. The United States is joining with theworld to supply aid where it reaches people and lifts up lives, to extend trade and theprosperity it brings, and to bring medical care where it is desperately needed. As a symbol ofour commitment to human dignity. The United States will return to UNESCO.This organization has been reformed, and America will participate fully in its mission toadvance human rights and tolerance and learning. Our common security is challenged byregional conflicts, ethnic and religious strife that is ancient, but not inevitable.In the Middle East there can be no peace for either side without freedom for both sides.America stands committed to an independent and democratic Palestine, living side-by-sidewith Israel in peace and security. Like all other people, Palestinians deserve a governmentthat serves their interests and listens to their voices. My nation will continue to encourage allparties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and comprehensive settlement tothe conflict.Above all, our principles and our security are challenged today by outlaw groups and regimesthat accept no law of morality and have no limit to their violent ambitions. In the attacks onAmerica a year ago, we saw the destructive intentions of our enemies. This threat hides withinmany nations, including my own.In cells, in camps, terrorists are plotting further destruction and building new bases for theirwar against civilization. And our greatest fear is that terrorists will find a shortcut to their madambitions when an outlaw regime supplies them with the technologies to kill on a massivescale. In one place and one regime, we find all these dangers in their most lethal andaggressive forms, exactly the kind of aggressive threat the United Nations was born toconfront.Twelve years ago, Iraq invaded Kuwait without provocation. And the regime's forces werepoised to continue their march to seize other countries and their resources. Had SaddamHussein been appeased instead of stopped, he would have endangered the peace and stabilityof the world. Yet this aggression was stopped by the might of coalition forces and the will ofthe United Nations.To suspend hostilities, to spare himself, Iraq's dictator accepted a series of commitments. Theterms were clear to him and to all, and he agreed to prove he is complying with every one ofthose obligations. He has proven instead only his contempt for the United Nations and for allhis pledges. By breaking every pledge, by his deceptions and by his cruelties, Saddam Husseinhas made the case against himself.In 1991, Security Council Resolution 688 demanded that the Iraqi regime cease at once therepression of its own people, including the systematic repression of minorities, which thecouncil said threatened international peace and security in the region. This demand goesignored.Last year, the U.N. Commission on Human Rights found that Iraq continues to commitextremely grave violations of human rights and that the regime's repression is all-pervasive.Tens of thousands of political opponents and ordinary citizens have been subjected toarbitrary arrest and imprisonment, summary execution and torture by beating and burning,electric shock, starvation, mutilation and rape. Wives are tortured in front of their husbands; children in the presence of their parents; and allof these horrors concealed from the world by the apparatus of a totalitarian state. In 1991, the U.N. Security Council, through Resolutions 686 and 687, demanded that Iraqreturn all prisoners from Kuwait and other lands. Iraq's regime agreed. It broke this promise. Last year, the Secretary General's high-level coordinator for this issue reported that Kuwaiti,Saudi, Indian, Syrian, Lebanese, Iranian, Egyptian, Bahraini and Armeni nationals remainunaccounted for; more than 600 people. One American pilot is among them. In 1991, the U.N. Security Council through Resolution 687 demanded that Iraq renounce allinvolvement with terrorism and permit no terrorist organizations to operate in Iraq. Iraq's regime agreed that broke this promise. In violation of Security Council Resolution 1373, Iraq continues to shelter and support terroristorganizations that direct violence against Iran, Israel and Western governments. Iraqidissidents abroad are targeted for murder. In 1993, Iraq attempted to assassinate the Amir of Kuwait and a former American president.Iraq's government openly praised the attacks of September 11. And Al Qaeda terroristsescaped from Afghanistan and are known to be in Iraq. In 1991, the Iraqi regime agreed destroy and stop developing all weapons of mass destructionand long range missiles and to prove to the world it has done so by complying with rigorousinspections. Iraq has broken every aspect of this fundamental pledge.From 1991 to 1995, the Iraqi regime said it had no biological weapons. After a senior officialin its weapons program defected and exposed this lie, the regime admitted to producing tensof thousands of liters of anthrax and other deadly biological agents for use with scudwarheads, aerial bombs and aircraft spray tanks. U.N. inspectors believe Iraq has produced two to four times the amount of biological agents itdeclared and has failed to account for more than three metric tons of material that could beused to produce biological weapons. Right now, Iraq is expanding and improving facilities thatwere used for the production of biological weapons. United Nations' inspections also reviewed that Iraq like maintains stockpiles of VX, mustardand other chemical agents, and that the regime is rebuilding and expanding facilities capableof producing chemical weapons. And in 1995, after four years of deception, Iraq finally admitted it had a crash nuclearweapons program prior to the Gulf War. We know now, were it not for that war, the regime in Iraq would likely have possessed anuclear weapon no later than 1993. Today, Iraq continues to withhold important information about its nuclear program, weaponsdesign, procurement logs, experiment data, and accounting of nuclear materials anddocumentation of foreign assistance. Iraq employs capable nuclear scientists and technicians.It retains physical infrastructure needed to build a nuclear weapon. Iraq has made several attempts to buy high-strength aluminum tubes used to enrich uraniumfor a nuclear weapon. Should Iraq acquire fissile material, it would be able to build a nuclearweapon within a year. And Iraq's state-controlled media has reported numerous meetings between Saddam Husseinand his nuclear scientists, leaving little doubt about his continued appetite for these weapons. Iraq also possesses a force of SCUD type missiles with ranges beyond the 150 kilometerspermitted by the U.N. Work at testing and production facilities shows that Iraq is buildingmore long range missiles that can inflict mass death throughout the region. In 1990, after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the world imposed economic sanctions on Iraq. Thosesanctions were maintained after the war to compel the regime's compliance with SecurityCouncil Resolutions.In time, Iraq was allowed to use oil revenues to buy food. Saddam Hussein has subverted thisprogram, working around the sanctions to buy missile technology and military materials. Heblames the suffering of Iraq's people on the United Nations, even as he uses his oil wealth tobuild lavish palaces for himself and to buy arms for his country. By refusing to comply with his own agreements, he bears full guilt for the hunger and miseryof innocent Iraqi citizens. In 1991, Iraq promised U.N. inspectors immediate and unrestrictedaccess to verify Iraq's commitment to rid itself of weapons of mass destruction and long rangemissiles. Iraq broke this promise, spending seven years deceiving, evading and harassing U.N.inspectors before ceasing cooperation entirely. Just months after the 1991 cease-fire, the Security Council twice renewed its demand that theIraqi regime cooperate fully with inspectors, condemning Iraq's serious violations of itsobligations. The Security Council again renewed that demand in 1994, and twice more in 1996, deploringIraq's clear violations of its obligations. The Security Council renewed its demand three moretimes in 1997, citing flagrant violations, and three more times in 1998, calling Iraq's behaviortotally unacceptable. And in 1999, the demand was renewed yet again. As we meet today, it's been almost four years since the last U.N. inspector set foot in Iraq --four years for the Iraqi regime to plan and to build and to test behind the cloak of secrecy. Weknow that Saddam Hussein pursued weapons of mass murder even when inspectors were inhis country. Are we to assume that he stopped when they left? The history, the logic and the facts lead to one conclusion: Saddam Hussein regime is a graveand gathering danger. To suggest otherwise is to hope against the evidence. To assume this regime's good faith is tobet the lives of millions and the peace of the world in a reckless gamble, and this is a risk wemust not take. Delegates to the General Assembly, we have been more than patient. We've tried sanctions.We've tried the carrot of oil for food and the stick of coalition military strikes. But SaddamHussein has defied all these efforts and continues to develop weapons of mass destruction. The first time we may be completely certain he has nuclear weapons is when, God forbid, heuses one. We owe it to all our citizens to do everything in our power to prevent that day fromcoming. The conduct of the Iraqi regime is a threat to the authority of the United Nations and a threatto peace. Iraq has answered a decade of U.N. demands with a decade of defiance. All theworld now faces a test, and the United Nations a difficult and defining moment.Are Security Council resolutions to be honored and enforced or cast aside withoutconsequence? Will the United Nations serve the purpose of its founding or will it be irrelevant? The United States help found the United Nations. We want the United Nations to be effectiveand respectful and successful. We want the resolutions of the world's most importantmultilateral body to be enforced. And right now those resolutions are being unilaterallysubverted by the Iraqi regime. Our partnership of nations can meet the test before us by making clear what we now expectof the Iraqi regime. If the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will immediately and unconditionally forswear, disclose andremove or destroy all weapons of mass destruction, long-range missiles and all relatedmaterial. If the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will immediately end all support for terrorism and act tosuppress it -- as all states are required to do by U.N. Security Council resolutions. If the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will cease persecution of its civilian population, includingShi'a, Sunnis, Kurds, Turkemens and others -- again, as required by Security Councilresolutions. If the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will release or account for all Gulf War personnel whosefate is still unknown. It will return the remains of any who are deceased, return stolen property, accept liability forlosses resulting from the invasion of Kuwait and fully cooperate with international efforts toresolve these issues as required by Security Council resolutions. If the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will immediately end all illicit trade outside the oil-for-foodprogram. It will accept U.N. administration of funds from that program to ensure that themoney is used fairly and promptly for the benefit of the Iraqi people. If all these steps are taken, it will signal a new openness and accountability in Iraq and itcould open the prospect of the United Nations helping to build a government that representsall Iraqis, a government based on respect for human rights, economic liberty andinternationally supervised elections. The United States has no quarrel with the Iraqi people. They've suffered too long in silentcaptivity. Liberty for the Iraqi people is a great moral cause and a great strategic goal.The people of Iraq deserve it. The security of all nations requires it. Free societies do notintimidate through cruelty and conquest. And open societies do not threaten the world withmass murder. The United States supports political and economic liberty in a unified Iraq. We can harbor no illusions, and that's important today to remember. Saddam Husseinattacked Iran in 1980 and Kuwait in 1990. He's fired ballistic missiles at Iran and SaudiArabia, Bahrain and Israel. His regime once ordered the killing of every person between theages of 15 and 70 in certain Kurdish villages in northern Iraq. He has gassed many Iraniansand 40 Iraqi villages. My nation will work with the U.N. Security Council to meet our common challenge. If Iraq'sregime defies us again, the world must move deliberately, decisively to hold Iraq to account.We will work with the U.N. Security Council for the necessary resolutions. But the purposes of the United States should not be doubted. The Security Council resolutionswill be enforced, the just demands of peace and security will be met or action will beunavoidable and a regime that has lost its legitimacy will also lose its power. Events can turn in one of two ways. If we fail to act in the face of danger, the people of Iraqwill continue to live in brutal submission. The regime will have new power to bully anddominate and conquer its neighbors, condemning the Middle East to more years of bloodshedand fear. The regime will remain unstable -- the region will remain unstable, with little hope offreedom and isolated from the progress of our times. With every step the Iraqi regime takes toward gaining and deploying the most terribleweapons, our own options to confront that regime will narrow. And if an emboldened regimewere to supply these weapons to terrorists allies, then the attacks of September 11 would bea prelude to far greater horrors. If we meet our responsibilities, if we overcome this danger, we can arrive at a very differentfuture. The people of Iraq can shake off their captivity. They can one day join a democraticAfghanistan and a democratic Palestine inspiring reforms throughout the Muslim world. Thesenations can show by their example that honest government and respect for women and thegreat Islamic tradition of learning can triumph in the Middle East and beyond. And we willshow that the promise of the United Nations can be fulfilled in our time. Neither of these outcomes is certain. Both have been set before us. We must choose betweena world of fear and a world of progress. We cannot stand by and do nothing while dangersgather. We must stand up for our security and for the permanent rights and the hopes ofmankind. By heritage and by choice, the United States of America will make that stand. And, delegatesto the United Nations, you have the power to make that stand, as well. Thank you very much.",bush
"Thank you for that very gracious and warm Cincinnati welcome. I'm honored to be heretonight; I appreciate you all coming. Tonight I want to take a few minutes to discuss a grave threat to peace, and America'sdetermination to lead the world in confronting that threat. The threat comes from Iraq. It arises directly from the Iraqi regime's own actions -- its historyof aggression, and its drive toward an arsenal of terror. Eleven years ago, as a condition forending the Persian Gulf War, the Iraqi regime was required to destroy its weapons of massdestruction, to cease all development of such weapons, and to stop all support for terroristgroups. The Iraqi regime has violated all of those obligations. It possesses and produceschemical and biological weapons. It is seeking nuclear weapons. It has given shelter andsupport to terrorism, and practices terror against its own people. The entire world haswitnessed Iraq's eleven-year history of defiance, deception and bad faith.We also must never forget the most vivid events of recent history. On September the 11th,2001, America felt its vulnerability -- even to threats that gather on the other side of theearth. We resolved then, and we are resolved today, to confront every threat, from anysource, that could bring sudden terror and suffering to America. Members of the Congress of both political parties, and members of the United Nations SecurityCouncil, agree that Saddam Hussein is a threat to peace and must disarm. We agree that theIraqi dictator must not be permitted to threaten America and the world with horrible poisonsand diseases and gases and atomic weapons. Since we all agree on this goal, the issues is :how can we best achieve it? Many Americans have raised legitimate questions: about the nature of the threat; about theurgency of action -- why be concerned now; about the link between Iraq developing weaponsof terror, and the wider war on terror. These are all issues we've discussed broadly and fullywithin my administration. And tonight, I want to share those discussions with you.  First, some ask why Iraq is different from other countries or regimes that also have terribleweapons. While there are many dangers in the world, the threat from Iraq stands alone --because it gathers the most serious dangers of our age in one place. Iraq's weapons of massdestruction are controlled by a murderous tyrant who has already used chemical weapons tokill thousands of people. This same tyrant has tried to dominate the Middle East, has invadedand brutally occupied a small neighbor, has struck other nations without warning, and holdsan unrelenting hostility toward the United States. By its past and present actions, by its technological capabilities, by the merciless nature of itsregime, Iraq is unique. As a former chief weapons inspector of the U.N. has said, ""Thefundamental problem with Iraq remains the nature of the regime, itself. Saddam Hussein is ahomicidal dictator who is addicted to weapons of mass destruction."" Some ask how urgent this danger is to America and the world. The danger is alreadysignificant, and it only grows worse with time. If we know Saddam Hussein has dangerousweapons today -- and we do -- does it make any sense for the world to wait to confront himas he grows even stronger and develops even more dangerous weapons? In 1995, after several years of deceit by the Iraqi regime, the head of Iraq's militaryindustries defected. It was then that the regime was forced to admit that it had producedmore than 30,000 liters of anthrax and other deadly biological agents.The inspectors, however, concluded that Iraq had likely produced two to four times thatamount. This is a massive stockpile of biological weapons that has never been accounted for,and capable of killing millions. We know that the regime has produced thousands of tons of chemical agents, includingmustard gas, sarin nerve gas, VX nerve gas. Saddam Hussein also has experience in usingchemical weapons. He has ordered chemical attacks on Iran, and on more than forty villagesin his own country. These actions killed or injured at least 20,000 people, more than six timesthe number of people who died in the attacks of September the 11th. And surveillance photos reveal that the regime is rebuilding facilities that it had used toproduce chemical and biological weapons. Every chemical and biological weapon that Iraq hasor makes is a direct violation of the truce that ended the Persian Gulf War in 1991. Yet,Saddam Hussein has chosen to build and keep these weapons despite international sanctions,U.N. demands, and isolation from the civilized world. Iraq possesses ballistic missiles with a likely range of hundreds of miles -- far enough to strikeSaudi Arabia, Israel, Turkey, and other nations -- in a region where more than 135,000American civilians and service members live and work. We've also discovered throughintelligence that Iraq has a growing fleet of manned and unmanned aerial vehicles that couldbe used to disperse chemical or biological weapons across broad areas. We're concerned thatIraq is exploring ways of using these UAVS for missions targeting the United States. And, ofcourse, sophisticated delivery systems aren't required for a chemical or biological attack; allthat might be required are a small container and one terrorist or Iraqi intelligence operative todeliver it. And that is the source of our urgent concern about Saddam Hussein's links to internationalterrorist groups. Over the years, Iraq has provided safe haven to terrorists such as Abu Nidal,whose terror organization carried out more than 90 terrorist attacks in 20 countries that killedor injured nearly 900 people, including 12 Americans. Iraq has also provided safe haven toAbu Abbas, who was responsible for seizing the Achille Lauro and killing an Americanpassenger. And we know that Iraq is continuing to finance terror and gives assistance togroups that use terrorism to undermine Middle East peace. We know that Iraq and the al Qaeda terrorist network share a common enemy -- the UnitedStates of America. We know that Iraq and al Qaeda have had high-level contacts that go backa decade. Some al Qaeda leaders who fled Afghanistan went to Iraq.These include one very senior al Qaeda leader who received medical treatment in Baghdadthis year, and who has been associated with planning for chemical and biological attacks.We've learned that Iraq has trained al Qaeda members in bomb-making and poisons anddeadly gases. And we know that after September the 11th, Saddam Hussein's regime gleefullycelebrated the terrorist attacks on America. Iraq could decide on any given day to provide a biological or chemical weapon to a terroristgroup or individual terrorists. Alliance with terrorists could allow the Iraqi regime to attackAmerica without leaving any fingerprints. Some have argued that confronting the threat from Iraq could detract from the war againstterror. To the contrary; confronting the threat posed by Iraq is crucial to winning the war onterror. When I spoke to Congress more than a year ago, I said that those who harborterrorists are as guilty as the terrorists themselves. Saddam Hussein is harboring terroristsand the instruments of terror, the instruments of mass death and destruction. And he cannotbe trusted. The risk is simply too great that he will use them, or provide them to a terrornetwork. Terror cells and outlaw regimes building weapons of mass destruction are different faces ofthe same evil. Our security requires that we confront both. And the United States military iscapable of confronting both. Many people have asked how close Saddam Hussein is to developing a nuclear weapon. Well,we don't know exactly, and that's the problem. Before the Gulf War, the best intelligenceindicated that Iraq was eight to ten years away from developing a nuclear weapon. After thewar, international inspectors learned that the regime has been much closer -- the regime inIraq would likely have possessed a nuclear weapon no later than 1993. The inspectorsdiscovered that Iraq had an advanced nuclear weapons development program, had a designfor a workable nuclear weapon, and was pursuing several different methods of enrichinguranium for a bomb. Before being barred from Iraq in 1998, the International Atomic Energy Agency dismantledextensive nuclear weapons-related facilities, including three uranium enrichment sites. Thatsame year, information from a high-ranking Iraqi nuclear engineer who had defected revealedthat despite his public promises, Saddam Hussein had ordered his nuclear program tocontinue.The evidence indicates that Iraq is reconstituting its nuclear weapons program. SaddamHussein has held numerous meetings with Iraqi nuclear scientists, a group he calls his""nuclear mujahideen"" -- his nuclear holy warriors. Satellite photographs reveal that Iraq isrebuilding facilities at sites that have been part of its nuclear program in the past. Iraq hasattempted to purchase high-strength aluminum tubes and other equipment needed for gascentrifuges, which are used to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons. If the Iraqi regime is able to produce, buy, or steal an amount of highly enriched uranium alittle larger than a single softball, it could have a nuclear weapon in less than a year. And if weallow that to happen, a terrible line would be crossed. Saddam Hussein would be in a positionto blackmail anyone who opposes his aggression. He would be in a position to dominate theMiddle East. He would be in a position to threaten America. And Saddam Hussein would be ina position to pass nuclear technology to terrorists. Some citizens wonder, after 11 years of living with this problem, why do we need to confrontit now? And there's a reason. We've experienced the horror of September the 11th. We haveseen that those who hate America are willing to crash airplanes into buildings full of innocentpeople. Our enemies would be no less willing, in fact, they would be eager, to use biological orchemical, or a nuclear weapon. Knowing these realities, America must not ignore the threat gathering against us. Facing clearevidence of peril, we cannot wait for the final proof -- the smoking gun -- that could come inthe form of a mushroom cloud. As President Kennedy said in October of 1962, ""Neither theUnited States of America, nor the world community of nations can tolerate deliberatedeception and offensive threats on the part of any nation, large or small. We no longer live ina world,"" he said, ""where only the actual firing of weapons represents a sufficient challenge toa nations security to constitute maximum peril."" Understanding the threats of our time, knowing the designs and deceptions of the Iraqiregime, we have every reason to assume the worst, and we have an urgent duty to preventthe worst from occurring. Some believe we can address this danger by simply resuming the old approach to inspections,and applying diplomatic and economic pressure. Yet this is precisely what the world has triedto do since 1991. The U.N. inspections program was met with systematic deception. The Iraqiregime bugged hotel rooms and offices of inspectors to find where they were going next; theyforged documents, destroyed evidence, and developed mobile weapons facilities to keep astep ahead of inspectors.Eight so-called presidential palaces were declared off-limits to unfettered inspections. Thesesites actually encompass twelve square miles, with hundreds of structures, both above andbelow the ground, where sensitive materials could be hidden. The world has also tried economic sanctions -- and watched Iraq use billions of dollars inillegal oil revenues to fund more weapons purchases, rather than providing for the needs ofthe Iraqi people. The world has tried limited military strikes to destroy Iraq's weapons of mass destructioncapabilities -- only to see them openly rebuilt, while the regime again denies they even exist. The world has tried no-fly zones to keep Saddam from terrorizing his own people -- and in thelast year alone, the Iraqi military has fired upon American and British pilots more than 750times. After eleven years during which we have tried containment, sanctions, inspections, evenselected military action, the end result is that Saddam Hussein still has chemical and biologicalweapons and is increasing his capabilities to make more. And he is moving ever closer todeveloping a nuclear weapon. Clearly, to actually work, any new inspections, sanctions or enforcement mechanisms willhave to be very different. America wants the U.N. to be an effective organization that helpskeep the peace. And that is why we are urging the Security Council to adopt a new resolutionsetting out tough, immediate requirements. Among those requirements: the Iraqi regimemust reveal and destroy, under U.N. supervision, all existing weapons of mass destruction. Toensure that we learn the truth, the regime must allow witnesses to its illegal activities to beinterviewed outside the country -- and these witnesses must be free to bring their familieswith them so they all beyond the reach of Saddam Hussein's terror and murder. Andinspectors must have access to any site, at any time, without pre-clearance, without delay,without exceptions. The time for denying, deceiving, and delaying has come to an end. Saddam Hussein mustdisarm himself -- or, for the sake of peace, we will lead a coalition to disarm him. Many nations are joining us in insisting that Saddam Hussein's regime be held accountable.They are committed to defending the international security that protects the lives of both ourcitizens and theirs. And that's why America is challenging all nations to take the resolutions ofthe U.N. Security Council seriously.And these resolutions are clear. In addition to declaring and destroying all of its weapons ofmass destruction, Iraq must end its support for terrorism. It must cease the persecution of itscivilian population. It must stop all illicit trade outside the Oil For Food program. It mustrelease or account for all Gulf War personnel, including an American pilot, whose fate is stillunknown. By taking these steps, and by only taking these steps, the Iraqi regime has an opportunity toavoid conflict. Taking these steps would also change the nature of the Iraqi regime itself.America hopes the regime will make that choice. Unfortunately, at least so far, we have littlereason to expect it. And that's why two administrations -- mine and President Clinton's --have stated that regime change in Iraq is the only certain means of removing a great dangerto our nation. I hope this will not require military action, but it may. And military conflict could be difficult.An Iraqi regime faced with its own demise may attempt cruel and desperate measures. IfSaddam Hussein orders such measures, his generals would be well advised to refuse thoseorders. If they do not refuse, they must understand that all war criminals will be pursued andpunished. If we have to act, we will take every precaution that is possible. We will plancarefully; we will act with the full power of the United States military; we will act with allies atour side, and we will prevail. There is no easy or risk-free course of action. Some have argued we should wait -- and that'san option. In my view, it's the riskiest of all options, because the longer we wait, the strongerand bolder Saddam Hussein will become. We could wait and hope that Saddam does not giveweapons to terrorists, or develop a nuclear weapon to blackmail the world. But I'm convincedthat is a hope against all evidence. As Americans, we want peace -- we work and sacrifice forpeace. But there can be no peace if our security depends on the will and whims of a ruthlessand aggressive dictator. I'm not willing to stake one American life on trusting SaddamHussein. Failure to act would embolden other tyrants, allow terrorists access to new weapons and newresources, and make blackmail a permanent feature of world events. The United Nationswould betray the purpose of its founding, and prove irrelevant to the problems of our time.And through its inaction, the United States would resign itself to a future of fear.That is not the America I know. That is not the America I serve. We refuse to live in fear. Thisnation, in world war and in Cold War, has never permitted the brutal and lawless to sethistory's course. Now, as before, we will secure our nation, protect our freedom, and helpothers to find freedom of their own. Some worry that a change of leadership in Iraq could create instability and make the situationworse. The situation could hardly get worse, for world security and for the people of Iraq. Thelives of Iraqi citizens would improve dramatically if Saddam Hussein were no longer in power,just as the lives of Afghanistan's citizens improved after the Taliban. The dictator of Iraq is astudent of Stalin, using murder as a tool of terror and control, within his own cabinet, withinhis own army, and even within his own family. On Saddam Hussein's orders, opponents have been decapitated, wives and mothers ofpolitical opponents have been systematically raped as a method of intimidation, and politicalprisoners have been forced to watch their own children being tortured. America believes that all people are entitled to hope and human rights, to the non-negotiabledemands of human dignity. People everywhere prefer freedom to slavery; prosperity tosqualor; self-government to the rule of terror and torture. America is a friend to the people ofIraq. Our demands are directed only at the regime that enslaves them and threatens us.When these demands are met, the first and greatest benefit will come to Iraqi men, womenand children. The oppression of Kurds, Assyrians, Turkomans, Shi'a, Sunnis and others will belifted. The long captivity of Iraq will end, and an era of new hope will begin. Iraq is a land rich in culture, resources, and talent. Freed from the weight of oppression,Iraq's people will be able to share in the progress and prosperity of our time. If military actionis necessary, the United States and our allies will help the Iraqi people rebuild their economy,and create the institutions of liberty in a unified Iraq at peace with its neighbors. Later this week, the United States Congress will vote on this matter. I have asked Congress toauthorize the use of America's military, if it proves necessary, to enforce U.N. Security Councildemands. Approving this resolution does not mean that military action is imminent orunavoidable. The resolution will tell the United Nations, and all nations, that America speakswith one voice and is determined to make the demands of the civilized world mean something.Congress will also be sending a message to the dictator in Iraq: that his only chance -- hisonly choice is full compliance, and the time remaining for that choice is limited.Members of Congress are nearing an historic vote. I'm confident they will fully consider thefacts, and their duties. The attacks of September the 11th showed our country that vast oceans no longer protect usfrom danger. Before that tragic date, we had only hints of al Qaeda's plans and designs.Today in Iraq, we see a threat whose outlines are far more clearly defined, and whoseconsequences could be far more deadly. Saddam Hussein's actions have put us on notice, andthere is no refuge from our responsibilities. We did not ask for this present challenge, but we accept it. Like other generations ofAmericans, we will meet the responsibility of defending human liberty against violence andaggression. By our resolve, we will give strength to others. By our courage, we will give hopeto others. And by our actions, we will secure the peace, and lead the world to a better day. May God bless America.",bush
"Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, distinguished citizens, and fellowcitizens: Every year, by law and by custom, we meet here to consider the state of the union.This year, we gather in this chamber deeply aware of decisive days that lie ahead.You and I serve our country in a time of great consequence. During this session of Congress,we have the duty to reform domestic programs vital to our country and we have theopportunity to save millions of lives abroad from a terrible disease. We will work for aprosperity that is broadly shared and we will answer every danger and every enemy thatthreatens the American people. In all these days of promise and days of reckoning, we can beconfident. In a whirlwind of change, and hope, and peril, our faith is sure, our resolve is firm,and our union is strong.This country has many challenges. We will not deny, we will not ignore, we will not pass alongour problems to other Congresses, other presidents, and other generations. We will confrontthem with focus, and clarity, and courage. During the last two years, we have seen what canbe accomplished when we work together.To lift the standards of our public schools, we achieved historic education reform -- whichmust now be carried out in every school, and every classroom, so that every child in Americacan read, and learn, and succeed in life. To protect our country, we reorganized ourgovernment and created the Department of Homeland Security -- which is mobilizing againstthe threats of a new era. To bring our economy out of recession, we delivered the largest taxrelief in a generation. To insist on integrity in American business, we passed tough reforms,and we are holding corporate criminals to account.Some might call this a good record. I call it a good start. Tonight I ask the House and Senateto join me in the next bold steps to serve our fellow citizens. Our first goal is clear: We musthave an economy that grows fast enough to employ every man and woman who seeks a job.After recession, terrorist attacks, corporate scandals, and stock market declines, our economyis recovering -- yet it is not growing fast enough, or strongly enough. With unemploymentrising, our Nation needs more small businesses to open, more companies to invest andexpand, more employers to put up the sign that says, ""Help Wanted."" Jobs are created whenthe economy grows; the economy grows when Americans have more money to spend andinvest; and the best, fairest way to make sure Americans have that money is not to tax itaway in the first place.I am proposing that all the income tax reductions set for 2004 and 2006 be made permanentand effective this year. And under my plan, as soon as I have signed the bill, this extra moneywill start showing up in workers' paychecks. Instead of gradually reducing the marriagepenalty, we should do it now. Instead of slowly raising the child credit to a thousand dollars,we should send the checks to American families now. This tax relief is for everyone who paysincome taxes -- and it will help our economy immediately. Ninety-two million Americans willkeep -- this year -- an average of almost 1,100 dollars more of their own money. A family offour with an income of 40,000 dollars would see their federal income taxes fall from 1,178dollars to 45 dollars per year. And our plan will improve the bottom line for more than 23million small businesses.You, the Congress, have already passed all these reductions, and promised them for futureyears. If this tax relief is good for Americans three, or five, or seven years from now, it iseven better for Americans today. We also strengthen the economy by treating investorsequally in our tax laws. It is fair to tax a company's profits. It is not fair to again tax theshareholder on the same profits.To boost investor confidence, and to help the nearly 10 million seniors who receive dividendincome, I ask you to end the unfair double taxation of dividends. Lower taxes and greaterinvestment will help this economy expand. More jobs mean more taxpayers -- and higherrevenues to our government. The best way to address the deficit and move toward a balancedbudget is to encourage economic growth -- and to show some spending discipline inWashington, D.C. We must work together to fund only our most important priorities. I willsend you a budget that increases discretionary spending by four percent next year -- about asmuch as the average family's income is expected to grow. And that is a good benchmark forus: Federal spending should not rise any faster than the paychecks of American families. Agrowing economy, and a focus on essential priorities, will also be crucial to the future of SocialSecurity. As we continue to work together to keep Social Security sound and reliable, we mustoffer younger workers a chance to invest in retirement accounts that they will control and theywill own.Our second goal is high quality, affordable health care for all Americans. The American systemof medicine is a model of skill and innovation -- with a pace of discovery that is adding goodyears to our lives. Yet for many people, medical care costs too much -- and many have nocoverage at all. These problems will not be solved with a nationalized health care system thatdictates coverage and rations care. Instead, we must work toward a system in which allAmericans have a good insurance policy, choose their own doctors, and seniors and low-income Americans receive the help they need. Instead of bureaucrats, and trial lawyers, andHMOs, we must put doctors, and nurses, and patients back in charge of American medicine.Health care reform must begin with Medicare, because Medicare is the binding commitment ofa caring society. We must renew that commitment by giving seniors access to the preventivemedicine and new drugs that are transforming health care in America. Seniors happy with thecurrent Medicare system should be able to keep their coverage just the way it is. And just likeyou, the members of Congress, members of your staffs, and other federal employees, allseniors should have the choice of a health care plan that provides prescription drugs. Mybudget will commit an additional 400 billion dollars over the next decade to reform andstrengthen Medicare. Leaders of both political parties have talked for years aboutstrengthening Medicare -- I urge the members of this new Congress to act this year.To improve our health care system, we must address one of the prime causes of higher costs-- the constant threat that physicians and hospitals will be unfairly sued. Because of excessivelitigation, everybody pays more for health care -- and many parts of America are losing finedoctors. No one has ever been healed by a frivolous lawsuit -- and I urge the Congress topass medical liability reform.Our third goal is to promote energy independence for our country, while dramaticallyimproving the environment. I have sent you a comprehensive energy plan to promote energyefficiency and conservation, to develop cleaner technology, and to produce more energy athome. I have sent you Clear Skies legislation that mandates a 70 percent cut in air pollutionfrom power plants over the next 15 years. I have sent you a Healthy Forests Initiative, to helpprevent the catastrophic fires that devastate communities, kill wildlife, and burn away millionsof acres of treasured forest.I urge you to pass these measures, for the good of both our environment and our economy.Even more, I ask you to take a crucial step, and protect our environment in ways thatgenerations before us could not have imagined. In this century, the greatest environmentalprogress will come about, not through endless lawsuits or command and control regulations,but through technology and innovation. Tonight I am proposing 1.2 billion dollars in researchfunding so that America can lead the world in developing clean, hydrogen-poweredautomobiles. A simple chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen generates energy,which can be used to power a car -- producing only water, not exhaust fumes. With a newnational commitment, our scientists and engineers will overcome obstacles to taking thesecars from laboratory to showroom -- so that the first car driven by a child born today could bepowered by hydrogen, and pollution-free. Join me in this important innovation -- to make ourair significantly cleaner, and our country much less dependent on foreign sources of energy.Our fourth goal is to apply the compassion of America to the deepest problems of America.For so many in our country -- the homeless, the fatherless, the addicted -- the need is great.Yet there is power -- wonder-working power -- in the goodness, and idealism, and faith of theAmerican people.Americans are doing the work of compassion every day -- visiting prisoners, providing shelterto battered women, bringing companionship to lonely seniors. These good works deserve ourpraise; they deserve our personal support; and, when appropriate, they deserve theassistance of our government.I urge you to pass both my faith-based initiative and the Citizen Service Act -- to encourageacts of compassion that can transform America, one heart and one soul at a time.Last year, I called on my fellow citizens to participate in USA Freedom Corps, which isenlisting tens of thousands of new volunteers across America. Tonight I ask Congress and theAmerican people to focus the spirit of service and the resources of government on the needsof some of our most vulnerable citizens -- boys and girls trying to grow up without guidanceand attention, and children who have to go through a prison gate to be hugged by their momor dad. I propose a 450 million dollar initiative to bring mentors to more than a milliondisadvantaged junior high students and children of prisoners. Government will support thetraining and recruiting of mentors, yet it is the men and women of America who will fill theneed. One mentor, one person, can change a life forever -- and I urge you to be that oneperson.Another cause of hopelessness is addiction to drugs. Addiction crowds out friendship,ambition, moral conviction, and reduces all the richness of life to a single destructive desire.As a government, we are fighting illegal drugs by cutting off supplies, and reducing demandthrough anti-drug education programs. Yet for those already addicted, the fight against drugsis a fight for their own lives. Too many Americans in search of treatment cannot get it. Sotonight I propose a new 600 million dollar program to help an additional 300,000 Americansreceive treatment over the next three years.Our Nation is blessed with recovery programs that do amazing work. One of them is found atthe Healing Place Church in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. A man in the program said, ""God doesmiracles in people's lives, and you never think it could be you."" Tonight, let us bring to allAmericans who struggle with drug addiction this message of hope: The miracle of recovery ispossible, and it could be you. By caring for children who need mentors, and for addicted menand women who need treatment, we are building a more welcoming society -- a culture thatvalues every life. And in this work we must not overlook the weakest among us. I ask you toprotect infants at the very hour of birth, and end the practice of partial-birth abortion. Andbecause no human life should be started or ended as the object of an experiment, I ask you toset a high standard for humanity and pass a law against all human cloning.The qualities of courage and compassion that we strive for in America also determine ourconduct abroad. The American flag stands for more than our power and our interests. OurFounders dedicated this country to the cause of human dignity -- the rights of every personand the possibilities of every life. This conviction leads us into the world to help the afflicted,and defend the peace, and confound the designs of evil men. In Afghanistan, we helped toliberate an oppressed people, and we will continue helping them secure their country, rebuildtheir society, and educate all their children -- boys and girls. In the Middle East, we willcontinue to seek peace between a secure Israel and a democratic Palestine. Across the earth,America is feeding the hungry; more than 60 percent of international food aid comes as a giftfrom the people of the United States.As our Nation moves troops and builds alliances to make our world safer, we must alsoremember our calling, as a blessed country, to make this world better. Today, on thecontinent of Africa, nearly 30 million people have the AIDS virus -- including three millionchildren under the age of 15. There are whole countries in Africa where more than one-third ofthe adult population carries the infection. More than four million require immediate drugtreatment. Yet across that continent, only 50,000 AIDS victims -- only 50,000 -- are receivingthe medicine they need.Because the AIDS diagnosis is considered a death sentence, many do not seek treatment.Almost all who do are turned away. A doctor in rural South Africa describes his frustration. Hesays, ""We have no medicines. Wany hospitals tell [people], 'You've got AIDS. We can't helpyou. Go home and die.'"" In an age of miraculous medicines, no person should have to hearthose words. AIDS can be prevented. Anti-retroviral drugs can extend life for many years. Andthe cost of those drugs has dropped from 12,000 dollars a year to under 300 dollars a year --which places a tremendous possibility within our grasp.Ladies and gentlemen, seldom has history offered a greater opportunity to do so much for somany. We have confronted, and will continue to confront, HIV/AIDS in our own country. Andto meet a severe and urgent crisis abroad, tonight I propose the Emergency Plan for AIDSRelief -- a work of mercy beyond all current international efforts to help the people of Africa.This comprehensive plan will prevent seven million new AIDS infections, treat at least twomillion people with life-extending drugs, and provide humane care for millions of peoplesuffering from AIDS, and for children orphaned by AIDS.I ask the Congress to commit 15 billion dollars over the next five years, including nearly tenbillion dollars in new money, to turn the tide against AIDS in the most afflicted nations ofAfrica and the Caribbean.This Nation can lead the world in sparing innocent people from a plague of nature. And thisNation is leading the world in confronting and defeating the man-made evil of internationalterrorism. There are days when the American people do not hear news about the war onterror. There is never a day when I do not learn of another threat, or receive reports ofoperations in progress, or give an order in this global war against a scattered network ofkillers. The war goes on, and we are winning. To date we have arrested, or otherwise dealtwith, many key commanders of al-Qaida. They include a man who directed logistics andfunding for the September 11th attacks, the chief of al-Qaida operations in the Persian Gulfwho planned the bombings of our embassies in East Africa and the USS Cole, an al-Qaidaoperations chief from Southeast Asia, a former director of al-Qaida's training camps inAfghanistan, a key al-Qaida operative in Europe, and a major al-Qaida leader in Yemen. Alltold, more than 3,000 suspected terrorists have been arrested in many countries. And manyothers have met a different fate. They are no longer a problem for the United States and ourfriends and allies.We are working closely with other nations to prevent further attacks. America and coalitioncountries have uncovered and stopped terrorist conspiracies targeting the American embassyin Yemen, the American embassy in Singapore, a Saudi military base, and ships in the straitsof Hormuz, and the straits of Gibraltar. We have broken al-Qaida cells in Hamburg, and Milan,and Madrid, and London, and Paris -- as well as Buffalo, New York. We have the terrorists onthe run, and we are keeping them on the run. One by one, the terrorists are learning themeaning of American justice. As we fight this war, we will remember where it began -- here,in our own country. This government is taking unprecedented measures to protect our peopleand defend our homeland. We have intensified security at the borders and ports of entry,posted more than 50,000 newly trained federal screeners in airports, begun inoculating troopsand first responders against smallpox, and are deploying the Nation's first early warningnetwork of sensors to detect biological attack. And this year, for the first time, we arebeginning to field a defense to protect this Nation against ballistic missiles.I thank the Congress for supporting these measures. I ask you tonight to add to our futuresecurity with a major research and production effort to guard our people against bio-terrorism, called Project Bioshield. The budget I send you will propose almost six billion dollarsto quickly make available effective vaccines and treatments against agents like anthrax,botulinum toxin, Ebola, and plague. We must assume that our enemies would use thesediseases as weapons, and we must act before the dangers are upon us.Since September 11th, our intelligence and law enforcement agencies have worked moreclosely than ever to track and disrupt the terrorists. The FBI is improving its ability to analyzeintelligence, and transforming itself to meet new threats. And tonight, I am instructing theleaders of the FBI, Central Intelligence, Homeland Security, and the Department of Defense todevelop a Terrorist Threat Integration Center, to merge and analyze all threat information in asingle location. Our government must have the very best information possible, and we will useit to make sure the right people are in the right places to protect our citizens. Our war against terror is a contest of will, in which perseverance is power. In the ruins of twotowers, at the western wall of the Pentagon, on a field in Pennsylvania, this Nation made apledge, and we renew that pledge tonight: Whatever the duration of this struggle, andwhatever the difficulties, we will not permit the triumph of violence in the affairs of men  freepeople will set the course of history.Today, the gravest danger in the war on terror, the gravest danger facing America and theworld, is outlaw regimes that seek and possess nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons.These regimes could use such weapons for blackmail, terror, and mass murder. They couldalso give or sell those weapons to their terrorist allies, who would use them without the leasthesitation. This threat is new; America's duty is familiar. Throughout the 20th century, smallgroups of men seized control of great nations, built armies and arsenals, and set out todominate the weak and intimidate the world. In each case, their ambitions of cruelty andmurder had no limit. In each case, the ambitions of Hitlerism, militarism, and communismwere defeated by the will of free peoples, by the strength of great alliances, and by the mightof the United States of America. Now, in this century, the ideology of power and dominationhas appeared again, and seeks to gain the ultimate weapons of terror. Once again, this Nationand our friends are all that stand between a world at peace, and a world of chaos andconstant alarm. Once again, we are called to defend the safety of our people, and the hopesof all mankind. And we accept this responsibility.America is making a broad and determined effort to confront these dangers. We have calledon the United Nations to fulfill its charter, and stand by its demand that Iraq disarm. We arestrongly supporting the International Atomic Energy Agency in its mission to track and controlnuclear materials around the world. We are working with other governments to secure nuclearmaterials in the former Soviet Union, and to strengthen global treaties banning the productionand shipment of missile technologies and weapons of mass destruction.In all of these efforts, however, America's purpose is more than to follow a process -- it is toachieve a result: the end of terrible threats to the civilized world. All free nations have a stakein preventing sudden and catastrophic attack. We are asking them to join us, and many aredoing so. Yet the course of this Nation does not depend on the decisions of others. Whateveraction is required, whenever action is necessary, I will defend the freedom and security of theAmerican people. Different threats require different strategies. In Iran, we continue to see agovernment that represses its people, pursues weapons of mass destruction, and supportsterror. We also see Iranian citizens risking intimidation and death as they speak out forliberty, human rights, and democracy. Iranians, like all people, have a right to choose theirown government, and determine their own destiny -- and the United States supports theiraspirations to live in freedom.On the Korean peninsula, an oppressive regime rules a people living in fear and starvation.Throughout the 1990s, the United States relied on a negotiated framework to keep NorthKorea from gaining nuclear weapons. We now know that the regime was deceiving the world,and developing those weapons all along. And today the North Korean regime is using itsnuclear program to incite fear and seek concessions. America and the world will not beblackmailed. America is working with the countries of the region -- South Korea, Japan, China,and Russia -- to find a peaceful solution, and to show the North Korean government thatnuclear weapons will bring only isolation, economic stagnation, and continued hardship. TheNorth Korean regime will find respect in the world, and revival for its people, only when itturns away from its nuclear ambitions.Our Nation and the world must learn the lessons of the Korean peninsula, and not allow aneven greater threat to rise up in Iraq. A brutal dictator, with a history of reckless aggression,with ties to terrorism, with great potential wealth, will not be permitted to dominate a vitalregion and threaten the United States. Twelve years ago, Saddam Hussein faced the prospectof being the last casualty in a war he had started and lost.To spare himself, he agreed to disarm of all weapons of mass destruction. For the next 12years, he systematically violated that agreement. He pursued chemical, biological, and nuclearweapons even while inspectors were in his country. Nothing to date has restrained him fromhis pursuit of these weapons -- not economic sanctions, not isolation from the civilized world,not even cruise missile strikes on his military facilities. Almost three months ago, the UnitedNations Security Council gave Saddam Hussein his final chance to disarm. He has showninstead his utter contempt for the United Nations, and for the opinion of the world.The 108 UN weapons inspectors were not sent to conduct a scavenger hunt for hiddenmaterials across a country the size of California. The job of the inspectors is to verify thatIraq's regime is disarming. It is up to Iraq to show exactly where it is hiding its bannedweapons, lay those weapons out for the world to see, and destroy them as directed. Nothinglike this has happened.The United Nations concluded in 1999 that Saddam Hussein had biological weapons materialssufficient to produce over 25,000 liters of anthrax -- enough doses to kill several millionpeople. He has not accounted for that material. He has given no evidence that he hasdestroyed it. The United Nations concluded that Saddam Hussein had materials sufficient toproduce more than 38,000 liters of botulinum toxin -- enough to subject millions of people todeath by respiratory failure. He has not accounted for that material. He has given no evidencethat he has destroyed it.Our intelligence officials estimate that Saddam Hussein had the materials to produce as muchas 500 tons of sarin, mustard, and VX nerve agent. In such quantities, these chemical agentsalso could kill untold thousands. He has not accounted for these materials. He has given noevidence that he has destroyed them. U.S. intelligence indicates that Saddam Hussein hadupwards of 30,000 munitions capable of delivering chemical agents. Inspectors recentlyturned up 16 of them, despite Iraq's recent declaration denying their existence. SaddamHussein has not accounted for the remaining 29,984 of these prohibited munitions. He hasgiven no evidence that he has destroyed them. From three Iraqi defectors we know that Iraq,in the late 1990s, had several mobile biological weapons labs. These are designed to producegerm warfare agents, and can be moved from place to place to evade inspectors. SaddamHussein has not disclosed these facilities. He has given no evidence that he has destroyedthem.The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed in the 1990s that Saddam Hussein had anadvanced nuclear weapons development program, had a design for a nuclear weapon, andwas working on five different methods of enriching uranium for a bomb. The Britishgovernment has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities ofuranium from Africa. Our intelligence sources tell us that he has attempted to purchase highstrength aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production. Saddam Hussein has notcredibly explained these activities. He clearly has much to hide.The dictator of Iraq is not disarming. To the contrary, he is deceiving. From intelligencesources, we know, for instance, that thousands of Iraqi security personnel are at work hidingdocuments and materials from the UN inspectors -- sanitizing inspection sites, and monitoringthe inspectors themselves. Iraqi officials accompany the inspectors in order to intimidatewitnesses. Iraq is blocking U-2 surveillance flights requested by the United Nations. Iraqiintelligence officers are posing as the scientists inspectors are supposed to interview. Realscientists have been coached by Iraqi officials on what to say. And intelligence sourcesindicate that Saddam Hussein has ordered that scientists who cooperate with UN inspectors indisarming Iraq will be killed, along with their families.Year after year, Saddam Hussein has gone to elaborate lengths, spent enormous sums, takengreat risks, to build and keep weapons of mass destruction -- but why? The only possibleexplanation, the only possible use he could have for those weapons, is to dominate,intimidate, or attack. With nuclear arms or a full arsenal of chemical and biological weapons,Saddam Hussein could resume his ambitions of conquest in the Middle East, and create deadlyhavoc in the region. And this Congress and the American people must recognize anotherthreat. Evidence from intelligence sources, secret communications, and statements by peoplenow in custody, reveal that Saddam Hussein aids and protects terrorists, including membersof al-Qaida. Secretly, and without fingerprints, he could provide one of his hidden weapons toterrorists, or help them develop their own.Before September 11, 2001, many in the world believed that Saddam Hussein could becontained. But chemical agents and lethal viruses and shadowy terrorist networks are noteasily contained. Imagine those 19 hijackers with other weapons, and other plans -- this timearmed by Saddam Hussein. It would take just one vial, one canister, one crate slipped intothis country to bring a day of horror like none we have ever known. We will do everything inour power to make sure that day never comes.Some have said we must not act until the threat is imminent. Since when have terrorists andtyrants announced their intentions, politely putting us on notice before they strike? If thisthreat is permitted to fully and suddenly emerge, all actions, all words, and all recriminationswould come too late. Trusting in the sanity and restraint of Saddam Hussein is not a strategy,and it is not an option.This dictator, who is assembling the world's most dangerous weapons, has already used themon whole villages -- leaving thousands of his own citizens dead, blind, or disfigured. Iraqirefugees tell us how forced confessions are obtained -- by torturing children while theirparents are made to watch. International human rights groups have catalogued othermethods used in the torture chambers of Iraq: electric shock, burning with hot irons, drippingacid on the skin, mutilation with electric drills, cutting out tongues, and rape.If this is not evil, then evil has no meaning.And tonight I have a message for the brave and oppressed people of Iraq: Your enemy is notsurrounding your country -- your enemy is ruling your country. And the day he and his regimeare removed from power will be the day of your liberation.The world has waited 12 years for Iraq to disarm. America will not accept a serious andmounting threat to our country, our friends, and our allies. The United States will ask the UNSecurity Council to convene on February 5th to consider the facts of Iraq's ongoing defiance ofthe world. Secretary of State Powell will present information and intelligence about Iraq'sillegal weapons programs; its attempts to hide those weapons from inspectors; and its links toterrorist groups. We will consult, but let there be no misunderstanding: If Saddam Husseindoes not fully disarm, for the safety of our people, and for the peace of the world, we will leada coalition to disarm him.Tonight I also have a message for the men and women who will keep the peace, members ofthe American Armed Forces: Many of you are assembling in and near the Middle East, andsome crucial hours may lie ahead. In those hours, the success of our cause will depend onyou. Your training has prepared you. Your honor will guide you. You believe in America, andAmerica believes in you. Sending Americans into battle is the most profound decision apresident can make.The technologies of war have changed. The risks and suffering of war have not. For the braveAmericans who bear the risk, no victory is free from sorrow. This Nation fights reluctantly,because we know the cost, and we dread the days of mourning that always come.We seek peace. We strive for peace. And sometimes peace must be defended. A future livedat the mercy of terrible threats is no peace at all. If war is forced upon us, we will fight in ajust cause and by just means -- sparing, in every way we can, the innocent. And if war isforced upon us, we will fight with the full force and might of the United States military -- andwe will prevail. And as we and our coalition partners are doing in Afghanistan, we will bring tothe Iraqi people food, and medicines, and supplies and freedom.Many challenges, abroad and at home, have arrived in a single season. In two years, Americahas gone from a sense of invulnerability to an awareness of peril, from bitter division in smallmatters to calm unity in great causes. And we go forward with confidence, because this call ofhistory has come to the right country. Americans are a resolute people, who have risen toevery test of our time. Adversity has revealed the character of our country, to the world, andto ourselves. America is a strong Nation, and honorable in the use of our strength. Weexercise power without conquest, and sacrifice for the liberty of strangers. Americans are afree people, who know that freedom is the right of every person and the future of everynation. The liberty we prize is not America's gift to the world, it is God's gift to humanity.We Americans have faith in ourselves -- but not in ourselves alone. We do not claim to knowall the ways of Providence, yet we can trust in them, placing our confidence in the loving Godbehind all of life, and all of history. May He guide us now, and may God continue to bless theUnited States of America.Thank you.",bush

"Thank you. Don't go overboard. Sit down, please -- no place to sit. Okay, don't sit down. Thank you all for coming. Mr. Vice President, thank you very much. Chief of Staff Card, I'mhonored to have you by my side. I started work this morning and there he was, smiling andready to go on behalf of the American people. The First Lady and I have -- are honored to be living here and we're honored to be hostingthis event, the first we've done in this glorious room since -- since the Inauguration. I want to thank the family members who are here; thank you for your sacrifice; thank you forthe long hours, accepting the long hours that your loved one is about to put in on behalf ofthe American people. Some of the folks that are here have worked in past Administrations.Some of us, this is a new experience. But for all of us, it is an honor of a lifetime and it is ourprivilege to share this together.I am here to lead the Executive Branch of government. You all are here because you have myfull confidence. And we are here with the same basic purpose: to serve the American people.We have all taken an oath, and from this moment on it is our jobs to honor it. Today, everything is so promising and new. My hope is that the day will never come when anyof us take[s] this place for granted, and this honor for granted. As we serve, we must alwaysremember three things:First, we must remember the high standards that come with high office. This begins withcareful adherence to the rules. I expect every member of this Administration to stay wellwithin the boundaries that define legal and ethical conduct. This means avoiding even theappearance of problems. This means checking and, if need be, double-checking that the ruleshave been obeyed. This means never compromising those rules. No one in the White Houseshould be afraid to confront the people they work for, for ethical concerns. And no one shouldhesitate to confront me, as well. We're all accountable to one another. And above all, we're allaccountable to the law and to the American people. My White House Counsel, Al Gonzalez, ismy point man on these issues. If you have even a hint of ethical doubt, I urge you to talk toAl. Second, we must remember that high standards of conduct involve not only obeying the law,but showing civility. As we go about our work there is no excuse for arrogance, and never areason for disrespect toward others. People who work here are highly visible throughout thegovernment. In many way -- In many of your dealings, you'll be the face and voice of theWhite House staff. You'll be my representative. I expect each of you, as an official of thisAdministration, to be an example of humility and decency and fairness. And, finally, we must all remember that we are here for a reason. You and I and the VicePresident share the same goals for our country and the same commitment to achieving them.We are here to make progress. We are not here just to mark time. The next few weeks we'llaffirm the central policy goals of this Administration, beginning this week with educationreform. Everyone will know where we stand. Everyone will know where we're headed. Everymorning I want you to remember these goals. Every evening I want you to review theprogress we have made. I want it said of us, at the end of our service, that ""promises madewere promises kept.""On a mantle piece in this Great House is inscribed the prayer of John Adams, that only the""wise"" and ""honest"" may ""rule under this roof."" He was speaking of those who live here. Butwisdom and honesty are also required of those who work here. I know each of you is capableof meeting that charge. This is only our second day, but times [sic] moves fast around here.So let us begin the work we were hired to do and leave this a better place than we found it. God bless.",bush
"Their mission was almost complete, and we lost them so close to home. The men and womenof the Columbia had journeyed more than 6 million miles and were minutes away from arrivaland reunion.The loss was sudden and terrible, and for their families, the grief is heavy. Our nation sharesin your sorrow and in your pride. And today we remember not only one moment of tragedy,but seven lives of great purpose and achievement.To leave behind Earth and air and gravity is an ancient dream of humanity. For these seven, itwas a dream fulfilled. Each of these astronauts had the daring and discipline required of theircalling. Each of them knew that great endeavors are inseparable from great risks. And each ofthem accepted those risks willingly, even joyfully, in the cause of discovery. Rick Husband was a boy of four when he first thought of being an astronaut. Asa man, and having become an astronaut, he found it was even more important to love hisfamily and serve his Lord. One of Rick's favorite hymns was, ""How Great Thou Art,"" whichoffers these words of praise: ""I see the stars. I hear the mighty thunder. Thy powerthroughout the universe displayed.""David Brown was first drawn to the stars as a little boy with a telescope in hisback yard. He admired astronauts, but, as he said, ""I thought they were movie stars. Ithought I was kind of a normal kid."" David grew up to be a physician, an aviator who couldland on the deck of a carrier in the middle of the night, and a shuttle astronaut. His brotherasked him several weeks ago what would happen if something went wrong on their mission.David replied, ""This program will go on.""  Michael Anderson always wanted to fly planes, and rose to the rank ofLieutenant Colonel in the Air Force. Along the way, he became a role model -- especially forhis two daughters and for the many children he spoke to in schools. He said to them,""Whatever you want to be in life, you're training for it now."" He also told his minister, ""If thisthing doesn't come out right, don't worry about me. I'm just going on higher.""  Laurel Salton Clark was a physician and a flight surgeon who loved adventure,loved her work, loved her husband, and her son. A friend who heard Laurel speaking toMission Control said, ""There was a smile in her voice."" Laurel conducted some of theexperiments as Columbia orbited the Earth, and described seeing new life emerge from a tinycocoon. ""Life,"" she said, ""continues in a lot of places, and life is a magical thing.""None of our astronauts traveled a longer path to space than Kalpana Chawla.She left India as a student, but she would see the nation of her birth -- all of it -- fromhundreds of miles above. When the sad news reached her home town, an administrator at herhigh school recalled, ""She always said she wanted to reach the stars. She went there -- andbeyond."" Kalpana's native country mourns her today, and so does her adopted land.  Ilan Ramon also flew above his home, the land of Israel. He said, ""The quietthat envelopes space makes the beauty even more powerful. And I only hope that the quietcan one day spread to my country."" Ilan was a patriot -- the devoted son of a holocaustsurvivor, served his country in two wars. ""Ilan,"" said his wife, Rona, ""left us at his peakmoment, in his favorite place, with people he loved."" The Columbia's pilot was Commander Willie McCool, whom friends knew asthe most steady and dependable of men. In Lubbock today, they're thinking back to the EagleScout who became a distinguished Naval officer, and a fearless test pilot. One friendremembers Willie this way: ""He was blessed; and we were blessed to know him."" Our whole nation was blessed to have such men and women serving in our space program.Their loss is deeply felt, especially in this place, where so many of you called them friends.The people in NASA are being tested once again. In your grief, you are responding as yourfriends would have wished -- with focus, professionalism, and unbroken faith in the mission ofthis agency.Captain Brown was correct: America's space program will go on.This cause of exploration and discovery is not an option we choose; it is a desire written in thehuman heart. We are that part of creation which seeks to understand all creation. We find thebest among us, send them forth into unmapped darkness, and pray they will return. They goin peace for all mankind, and all mankind is in their debt.Yet, some explorers do not return. And the loss settles unfairly on a few. The families heretoday shared in the courage of those they loved. But now they must face life and grief withoutthem. The sorrow is lonely; but you are not alone. In time, you will find comfort and the graceto see you through. And in God's own time, we can pray that the day of your reunion willcome.And to the children who miss your Mom or Dad so much today, you need to know they loveyou, and that love will always be with you. They were proud of you. And you can be proud ofthem for the rest of your life. The final days of their own lives were spent looking down upon this Earth. And now, on everycontinent, in every land they could see, the names of these astronauts are known andremembered. They will always have an honored place in the memory of this country. Andtoday I offer the respect and gratitude of the people of the United States.May God bless you all.",bush
"Thanks for the warm welcome. I'm proud to be with the scholars, and the friends, and thesupporters of the American Enterprise Institute. I want to thank you for overlooking my dresscode violation.  They were about to stop me at the door, but Irving Kristol said, ""I know thisguy, let him in.""  Chris, thank you for your very kind introduction, and thank you for your leadership. I seemany distinguished guests here tonight -- members of my Cabinet, members of Congress,Justice Scalia, Justice Thomas, and so many respected writers and policy experts. I'm alwayshappy to see your Senior Fellow, Dr. Lynne Cheney.  Lynne is a wise and thoughtfulcommentator on history and culture, and a dear friend to Laura and me. I'm also familiar withthe good work of her husband --  You may remember him, the former director of my vicepresidential search committee.  Thank God Dick Cheney said yes.  Thanks for fitting me into the program tonight. I know I'm not the featured speaker. I'm justa warm-up act for Allan Meltzer. But I want to congratulate Dr. Meltzer for a lifetime ofachievement, and for tonight's well-deserved honor. Congratulations.At the American Enterprise Institute, some of the finest minds in our nation are at work onsome of the greatest challenges to our nation. You do such good work that my administrationhas borrowed 20 such minds. I want to thank them for their service, but I also want to remindpeople that for 60 years, AEI scholars have made vital contributions to our country and to ourgovernment, and we are grateful for those contributions. We meet here during a crucial period in the history of our nation, and of the civilized world.Part of that history was written by others; the rest will be written by us.  On a Septembermorning, threats that had gathered for years, in secret and far away, led to murder in ourcountry on a massive scale. As a result, we must look at security in a new way, because ourcountry is a battlefield in the first war of the 21st century. We learned a lesson: The dangers of our time must be confronted actively and forcefully,before we see them again in our skies and in our cities. And we set a goal: we will not allowthe triumph of hatred and violence in the affairs of men.  Our coalition of more than 90 countries is pursuing the networks of terror with every tool oflaw enforcement and with military power. We have arrested, or otherwise dealt with, manykey commanders of al Qaeda.  Across the world, we are hunting down the killers one by one.We are winning. And we're showing them the definition of American justice.  And we areopposing the greatest danger in the war on terror: outlaw regimes arming with weapons ofmass destruction. In Iraq, a dictator is building and hiding weapons that could enable him to dominate theMiddle East and intimidate the civilized world -- and we will not allow it.  This same tyrant hasclose ties to terrorist organizations, and could supply them with the terrible means to strikethis country -- and America will not permit it. The danger posed by Saddam Hussein and hisweapons cannot be ignored or wished away. The danger must be confronted. We hope thatthe Iraqi regime will meet the demands of the United Nations and disarm, fully and peacefully.If it does not, we are prepared to disarm Iraq by force. Either way, this danger will beremoved.The safety of the American people depends on ending this direct and growing threat. Actingagainst the danger will also contribute greatly to the long-term safety and stability of ourworld. The current Iraqi regime has shown the power of tyranny to spread discord andviolence in the Middle East. A liberated Iraq can show the power of freedom to transform thatvital region, by bringing hope and progress into the lives of millions. America's interests insecurity, and America's belief in liberty, both lead in the same direction: to a free and peacefulIraq.  The first to benefit from a free Iraq would be the Iraqi people, themselves. Today they live inscarcity and fear, under a dictator who has brought them nothing but war, and misery, andtorture. Their lives and their freedom matter little to Saddam Hussein -- but Iraqi lives andfreedom matter greatly to us.  Bringing stability and unity to a free Iraq will not be easy. Yet that is no excuse to leave theIraqi regime's torture chambers and poison labs in operation. Any future the Iraqi peoplechoose for themselves will be better than the nightmare world that Saddam Hussein haschosen for them.  If we must use force, the United States and our coalition stand ready to help the citizens of aliberated Iraq. We will deliver medicine to the sick, and we are now moving into place nearly 3million emergency rations to feed the hungry. We'll make sure that Iraq's 55,000 food distribution sites, operating under the Oil For Foodprogram, are stocked and open as soon as possible. The United States and Great Britain areproviding tens of millions of dollars to the U.N. High Commission on Refugees, and to suchgroups as the World Food Program and UNICEF, to provide emergency aid to the Iraqi people. We will also lead in carrying out the urgent and dangerous work of destroying chemical andbiological weapons. We will provide security against those who try to spread chaos, or settlescores, or threaten the territorial integrity of Iraq. We will seek to protect Iraq's naturalresources from sabotage by a dying regime, and ensure those resources are used for thebenefit of the owners -- the Iraqi people.The United States has no intention of determining the precise form of Iraq's new government.That choice belongs to the Iraqi people. Yet, we will ensure that one brutal dictator is notreplaced by another. All Iraqis must have a voice in the new government, and all citizens musthave their rights protected.  Rebuilding Iraq will require a sustained commitment from many nations, including our own:we will remain in Iraq as long as necessary, and not a day more. America has made and keptthis kind of commitment before -- in the peace that followed a world war. After defeatingenemies, we did not leave behind occupying armies, we left constitutions and parliaments. Weestablished an atmosphere of safety, in which responsible, reform-minded local leaders couldbuild lasting institutions of freedom. In societies that once bred fascism and militarism, libertyfound a permanent home. There was a time when many said that the cultures of Japan and Germany were incapable ofsustaining democratic values. Well, they were wrong. Some say the same of Iraq today. Theyare mistaken.  The nation of Iraq -- with its proud heritage, abundant resources and skilledand educated people -- is fully capable of moving toward democracy and living in freedom.  The world has a clear interest in the spread of democratic values, because stable and freenations do not breed the ideologies of murder. They encourage the peaceful pursuit of a betterlife. And there are hopeful signs of a desire for freedom in the Middle East. Arab intellectualshave called on Arab governments to address the ""freedom gap"" so their peoples can fullyshare in the progress of our times. Leaders in the region speak of a new Arab charter thatchampions internal reform, greater politics participation, economic openness, and free trade.And from Morocco to Bahrain and beyond, nations are taking genuine steps toward politicsreform. A new regime in Iraq would serve as a dramatic and inspiring example of freedom forother nations in the region.  It is presumptuous and insulting to suggest that a whole region of the world -- or the one-fifthof humanity that is Muslim -- is somehow untouched by the most basic aspirations of life.Human cultures can be vastly different. Yet the human heart desires the same good things,everywhere on Earth. In our desire to be safe from brutal and bullying oppression, humanbeings are the same. In our desire to care for our children and give them a better life, we arethe same. For these fundamental reasons, freedom and democracy will always andeverywhere have greater appeal than the slogans of hatred and the tactics of terror.Success in Iraq could also begin a new stage for Middle Eastern peace, and set in motionprogress towards a truly democratic Palestinian state.  The passing of Saddam Hussein'sregime will deprive terrorist networks of a wealthy patron that pays for terrorist training, andoffers rewards to families of suicide bombers. And other regimes will be given a clear warningthat support for terror will not be tolerated.  Without this outside support for terrorism, Palestinians who are working for reform and longfor democracy will be in a better position to choose new leaders.  True leaders who strive forpeace; true leaders who faithfully serve the people. A Palestinian state must be a reformedand peaceful state that abandons forever the use of terror.  For its part, the new government of Israel -- as the terror threat is removed and securityimproves -- will be expected to support the creation of a viable Palestinian state and to workas quickly as possible toward a final status agreement. As progress is made toward peace,settlement activity in the occupied territories must end.  And the Arab states will be expectedto meet their responsibilities to oppose terrorism, to support the emergence of a peaceful anddemocratic Palestine, and state clearly they will live in peace with Israel.  The United States and other nations are working on a road map for peace. We are setting outthe necessary conditions for progress toward the goal of two states, Israel and Palestine,living side by side in peace and security. It is the commitment of our government -- and mypersonal commitment -- to implement the road map and to reach that goal. Old patterns ofconflict in the Middle East can be broken, if all concerned will let go of bitterness, hatred, andviolence, and get on with the serious work of economic development, and political reform, andreconciliation. America will seize every opportunity in pursuit of peace. And the end of thepresent regime in Iraq would create such an opportunity.  In confronting Iraq, the United States is also showing our commitment to effectiveinternational institutions. We are a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.We helped to create the Security Council. We believe in the Security Council -- so much thatwe want its words to have meaning.The global threat of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction cannot be confronted by onenation alone. The world needs today and will need tomorrow international bodies with theauthority and the will to stop the spread of terror and chemical and biological and nuclearweapons. A threat to all must be answered by all. High-minded pronouncements againstproliferation mean little unless the strongest nations are willing to stand behind them -- anduse force if necessary. After all, the United Nations was created, as Winston Churchill said, to""make sure that the force of right will, in the ultimate issue, be protected by the right offorce."" Another resolution is now before the Security Council. If the council responds to Iraq'sdefiance with more excuses and delays, if all its authority proves to be empty, the UnitedNations will be severely weakened as a source of stability and order. If the members rise tothis moment, then the Council will fulfill its founding purpose. I've listened carefully, as people and leaders around the world have made known their desirefor peace. All of us want peace. The threat to peace does not come from those who seek toenforce the just demands of the civilized world; the threat to peace comes from those whoflout those demands. If we have to act, we will act to restrain the violent, and defend thecause of peace. And by acting, we will signal to outlaw regimes that in this new century, theboundaries of civilized behavior will be respected.  Protecting those boundaries carries a cost. If war is forced upon us by Iraq's refusal to disarm,we will meet an enemy who hides his military forces behind civilians, who has terribleweapons, who is capable of any crime. The dangers are real, as our soldiers, and sailors,airmen, and Marines fully understand. Yet, no military has ever been better prepared to meetthese challenges. Members of our Armed Forces also understand why they may be called to fight. They knowthat retreat before a dictator guarantees even greater sacrifices in the future. They know thatAmerica's cause is right and just: liberty for an oppressed people, and security for theAmerican people. And I know something about these men and women who wear our uniform:they will complete every mission they are given with skill, and honor, and courage.Much is asked of America in this year 2003. The work ahead is demanding. It will be difficultto help freedom take hold in a country that has known three decades of dictatorship, secretpolice, internal divisions, and war. It will be difficult to cultivate liberty and peace in the MiddleEast, after so many generations of strife. Yet, the security of our nation and the hope ofmillions depend on us, and Americans do not turn away from duties because they are hard.We have met great tests in other times, and we will meet the tests of our time.  We go forward with confidence, because we trust in the power of human freedom to changelives and nations. By the resolve and purpose of America, and of our friends and allies, we willmake this an age of progress and liberty. Free people will set the course of history, and freepeople will keep the peace of the world. Thank you all, very much.",bush
"My fellow citizens, events in Iraq have now reached the final days of decision. For more than adecade, the United States and other nations have pursued patient and honorable efforts todisarm the Iraqi regime without war. That regime pledged to reveal and destroy all itsweapons of mass destruction as a condition for ending the Persian Gulf War in 1991.Since then, the world has engaged in 12 years of diplomacy. We have passed more than adozen resolutions in the United Nations Security Council. We have sent hundreds of weaponsinspectors to oversee the disarmament of Iraq. Our good faith has not been returned.The Iraqi regime has used diplomacy as a ploy to gain time and advantage. It has uniformlydefied Security Council resolutions demanding full disarmament. Over the years, U.N. weaponinspectors have been threatened by Iraqi officials, electronically bugged, and systematicallydeceived. Peaceful efforts to disarm the Iraqi regime have failed again and again -- becausewe are not dealing with peaceful men.Intelligence gathered by this and other governments leaves no doubt that the Iraq regimecontinues to possess and conceal some of the most lethal weapons ever devised. This regimehas already used weapons of mass destruction against Iraq's neighbors and against Iraq'speople.The regime has a history of reckless aggression in the Middle East. It has a deep hatred ofAmerica and our friends. And it has aided, trained, and harbored terrorists, includingoperatives of al Qaeda.The danger is clear: using chemical, biological, or, one day, nuclear weapons, obtained withthe help of Iraq, the terrorists could fulfill their stated ambitions and kill thousands orhundreds of thousands of innocent people in our country, or any other.The United States and other nations did nothing to deserve or invite this threat. But we will doeverything to defeat it. Instead of drifting along toward tragedy, we will set a course towardsafety. Before the day of horror can come, before it is too late to act, this danger will beremoved.The United States of America has the sovereign authority to use force in assuring its ownnational security. That duty falls to me, as Commander-in-Chief, by the oath I have sworn, bythe oath I will keep.Recognizing the threat to our country, the United States Congress voted overwhelmingly lastyear to support the use of force against Iraq. America tried to work with the United Nations toaddress this threat because we wanted to resolve the issue peacefully. We believe in themission of the United Nations. One reason the U.N. was founded after the second world warwas to confront aggressive dictators, actively and early, before they can attack the innocentand destroy the peace.In the case of Iraq, the Security Council did act, in the early 1990s. Under Resolutions 678and 687 -- both still in effect -- the United States and our allies are authorized to use force inridding Iraq of weapons of mass destruction. This is not a question of authority; it is aquestion of will.Last September, I went to the U.N. General Assembly and urged the nations of the world tounite and bring an end to this danger. On November 8th, the Security Council unanimouslypassed Resolution 1441, finding Iraq in material breach of its obligations, and vowing seriousconsequences if Iraq did not fully and immediately disarm.Today, no nation can possibly claim that Iraq has disarmed. And it will not disarm so long asSaddam Hussein holds power. For the last four-and-a-half months, the United States and ourallies have worked within the Security Council to enforce that Council's long-standingdemands. Yet, some permanent members of the Security Council have publicly announcedthey will veto any resolution that compels the disarmament of Iraq. These governments shareour assessment of the danger, but not our resolve to meet it. Many nations, however, do havethe resolve and fortitude to act against this threat to peace, and a broad coalition is nowgathering to enforce the just demands of the world. The United Nations Security Council hasnot lived up to its responsibilities, so we will rise to ours.In recent days, some governments in the Middle East have been doing their part. They havedelivered public and private messages urging the dictator to leave Iraq, so that disarmamentcan proceed peacefully. He has thus far refused. All the decades of deceit and cruelty havenow reached an end. Saddam Hussein and his sons must leave Iraq within 48 hours. Theirrefusal to do so will result in military conflict, commenced at a time of our choosing. For theirown safety, all foreign nationals -- including journalists and inspectors -- should leave Iraqimmediately.Many Iraqis can hear me tonight in a translated radio broadcast, and I have a message forthem. If we must begin a military campaign, it will be directed against the lawless men whorule your country and not against you. As our coalition takes away their power, we will deliverthe food and medicine you need. We will tear down the apparatus of terror and we will helpyou to build a new Iraq that is prosperous and free. In a free Iraq, there will be no more warsof aggression against your neighbors, no more poison factories, no more executions ofdissidents, no more torture chambers and rape rooms. The tyrant will soon be gone. The dayof your liberation is near.It is too late for Saddam Hussein to remain in power. It is not too late for the Iraqi military toact with honor and protect your country by permitting the peaceful entry of coalition forces toeliminate weapons of mass destruction. Our forces will give Iraqi military units clearinstructions on actions they can take to avoid being attacked and destroyed. I urge everymember of the Iraqi military and intelligence services, if war comes, do not fight for a dyingregime that is not worth your own life.And all Iraqi military and civilian personnel should listen carefully to this warning: In anyconflict, your fate will depend on your actions. Do not destroy oil wells, a source of wealth thatbelongs to the Iraqi people. Do not obey any command to use weapons of mass destructionagainst anyone, including the Iraqi people. War crimes will be prosecuted. War criminals willbe punished. And it will be no defense to say, ""I was just following orders.""Should Saddam Hussein choose confrontation, the American people can know that everymeasure has been taken to avoid war, and every measure will be taken to win it. Americansunderstand the costs of conflict because we have paid them in the past. War has no certainty,except the certainty of sacrifice.Yet, the only way to reduce the harm and duration of war is to apply the full force and mightof our military, and we are prepared to do so. If Saddam Hussein attempts to cling to power,he will remain a deadly foe until the end. In desperation, he and terrorists groups might try toconduct terrorist operations against the American people and our friends. These attacks arenot inevitable. They are, however, possible. And this very fact underscores the reason wecannot live under the threat of blackmail. The terrorist threat to America and the world will bediminished the moment that Saddam Hussein is disarmed.Our government is on heightened watch against these dangers. Just as we are preparing toensure victory in Iraq, we are taking further actions to protect our homeland. In recent days,American authorities have expelled from the country certain individuals with ties to Iraqiintelligence services. Among other measures, I have directed additional security of ourairports, and increased Coast Guard patrols of major seaports. The Department of HomelandSecurity is working closely with the nation's governors to increase armed security at criticalfacilities across America.Should enemies strike our country, they would be attempting to shift our attention with panicand weaken our morale with fear. In this, they would fail. No act of theirs can alter the courseor shake the resolve of this country. We are a peaceful people -- yet we're not a fragilepeople, and we will not be intimidated by thugs and killers. If our enemies dare to strike us,they and all who have aided them, will face fearful consequences.We are now acting because the risks of inaction would be far greater. In one year, or fiveyears, the power of Iraq to inflict harm on all free nations would be multiplied many timesover. With these capabilities, Saddam Hussein and his terrorist allies could choose themoment of deadly conflict when they are strongest. We choose to meet that threat now,where it arises, before it can appear suddenly in our skies and cities.The cause of peace requires all free nations to recognize new and undeniable realities. In the20th century, some chose to appease murderous dictators, whose threats were allowed togrow into genocide and global war. In this century, when evil men plot chemical, biological,and nuclear terror, a policy of appeasement could bring destruction of a kind never beforeseen on this earth.Terrorists and terror states do not reveal these threats with fair notice, in formal declarations-- and responding to such enemies only after they have struck first is not self-defense; it issuicide. The security of the world requires disarming Saddam Hussein now.As we enforce the just demands of the world, we will also honor the deepest commitments ofour country. Unlike Saddam Hussein, we believe the Iraqi people are deserving and capable ofhuman liberty. And when the dictator has departed, they can set an example to all the MiddleEast of a vital and peaceful and self-governing nation.The United States, with other countries, will work to advance liberty and peace in that region.Our goal will not be achieved overnight, but it can come over time. The power and appeal ofhuman liberty is felt in every life and every land. And the greatest power of freedom is toovercome hatred and violence, and turn the creative gifts of men and women to the pursuitsof peace.That is the future we choose. Free nations have a duty to defend our people by uniting againstthe violent. And tonight, as we have done before, America and our allies accept thatresponsibility.Good night, and may God continue to bless America.",bush

"Admiral Kelly, Captain Card, officers and sailors of the USS Abraham Lincoln, my fellowAmericans: Major combat operations in Iraq have ended. In the battle of Iraq, the UnitedStates and our allies have prevailed. And now our coalition is engaged in securing andreconstructing that country.In this battle, we have fought for the cause of liberty, and for the peace of the world. Ournation and our coalition are proud of this accomplishment -- yet, it is you, the members of theUnited States military, who achieved it. Your courage, your willingness to face danger for yourcountry and for each other, made this day possible. Because of you, our nation is moresecure. Because of you, the tyrant has fallen, and Iraq is free.Operation Iraqi Freedom was carried out with a combination of precision and speed andboldness the enemy did not expect, and the world had not seen before. From distant bases orships at sea, we sent planes and missiles that could destroy an enemy division, or strike asingle bunker. Marines and soldiers charged to Baghdad across 350 miles of hostile ground, inone of the swiftest advances of heavy arms in history. You have shown the world the skill andthe might of the American Armed Forces. This nation thanks all the members of our coalition who joined in a noble cause. We thank theArmed Forces of the United Kingdom, Australia, and Poland, who shared in the hardships ofwar. We thank all the citizens of Iraq who welcomed our troops and joined in the liberation oftheir own country. And tonight, I have a special word for Secretary Rumsfeld, for GeneralFranks, and for all the men and women who wear the uniform of the United States: America isgrateful for a job well done.The character of our military through history -- the daring of Normandy, the fierce courage ofIwo Jima, the decency and idealism that turned enemies into allies -- is fully present in thisgeneration. When Iraqi civilians looked into the faces of our servicemen and women, they sawstrength and kindness and goodwill. When I look at the members of the United Statesmilitary, I see the best of our country, and I'm honored to be your Commander-in-Chief.  In the images of falling statues, we have witnessed the arrival of a new era. For a hundred ofyears of war, culminating in the nuclear age, military technology was designed and deployedto inflict casualties on an ever-growing scale. In defeating Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan,Allied forces destroyed entire cities, while enemy leaders who started the conflict were safeuntil the final days. Military power was used to end a regime by breaking a nation. Today, we have the greater power to free a nation by breaking a dangerous and aggressiveregime. With new tactics and precision weapons, we can achieve military objectives withoutdirecting violence against civilians. No device of man can remove the tragedy from war; yet itis a great moral advance when the guilty have far more to fear from war than the innocent.In the images of celebrating Iraqis, we have also seen the ageless appeal of human freedom.Decades of lies and intimidation could not make the Iraqi people love their oppressors ordesire their own enslavement.Men and women in every culture need liberty like they need food and water and air.Everywhere that freedom arrives, humanity rejoices; and everywhere that freedom stirs, lettyrants fear.We have difficult work to do in Iraq. We're bringing order to parts of that country that remaindangerous. We're pursuing and finding leaders of the old regime, who will be held to accountfor their crimes. We've begun the search for hidden chemical and biological weapons andalready know of hundreds of sites that will be investigated. We're helping to rebuild Iraq,where the dictator built palaces for himself, instead of hospitals and schools. And we will standwith the new leaders of Iraq as they establish a government of, by, and for the Iraqi people.The transition from dictatorship to democracy will take time, but it is worth every effort. Ourcoalition will stay until our work is done. Then we will leave, and we will leave behind a freeIraq. The battle of Iraq is one victory in a war on terror that began on September the 11, 2001 --and still goes on. That terrible morning, 19 evil men -- the shock troops of a hateful ideology -- gave America and the civilized world a glimpse of their ambitions. They imagined, in thewords of one terrorist, that September the 11th would be the ""beginning of the end ofAmerica."" By seeking to turn our cities into killing fields, terrorists and their allies believedthat they could destroy this nation's resolve, and force our retreat from the world. They havefailed.In the battle of Afghanistan, we destroyed the Taliban, many terrorists, and the camps wherethey trained. We continue to help the Afghan people lay roads, restore hospitals, and educateall of their children. Yet we also have dangerous work to complete. As I speak, a SpecialOperations task force, led by the 82nd Airborne, is on the trail of the terrorists and those whoseek to undermine the free government of Afghanistan. America and our coalition will finishwhat we have begun.From Pakistan to the Philippines to the Horn of Africa, we are hunting down al Qaeda killers.Nineteen months ago, I pledged that the terrorists would not escape the patient justice of theUnited States. And as of tonight, nearly one-half of al Qaeda's senior operatives have beencaptured or killed.The liberation of Iraq is a crucial advance in the campaign against terror. We've removed anally of al Qaeda, and cut off a source of terrorist funding. And this much is certain: Noterrorist network will gain weapons of mass destruction from the Iraqi regime, because theregime is no more.In these 19 months that changed the world, our actions have been focused and deliberate andproportionate to the offense. We have not forgotten the victims of September the 11th -- thelast phone calls, the cold murder of children, the searches in the rubble. With those attacks,the terrorists and their supporters declared war on the United States. And war is what theygot.Our war against terror is proceeding according to principles that I have made clear to all: Anyperson involved in committing or planning terrorist attacks against the American peoplebecomes an enemy of this country, and a target of American justice. Any person,organization, or government that supports, protects, or harbors terrorists is complicit in themurder of the innocent, and equally guilty of terrorist crimes. Any outlaw regime that has tiesto terrorist groups and seeks or possesses weapons of mass destruction is a grave danger tothe civilized world -- and will be confronted. And anyone in the world, including the Arabworld, who works and sacrifices for freedom has a loyal friend in the United States of America. Our commitment to liberty is America's tradition -- declared at our founding; affirmed inFranklin Roosevelt's Four Freedoms; asserted in the Truman Doctrine and in Ronald Reagan'schallenge to an evil empire. We are committed to freedom in Afghanistan, in Iraq, and in apeaceful Palestine. The advance of freedom is the surest strategy to undermine the appeal ofterror in the world. Where freedom takes hold, hatred gives way to hope. When freedom takeshold, men and women turn to the peaceful pursuit of a better life. American values andAmerican interests lead in the same direction: We stand for human liberty.The United States upholds these principles of security and freedom in many ways -- with allthe tools of diplomacy, law enforcement, intelligence, and finance. We're working with a broadcoalition of nations that understand the threat and our shared responsibility to meet it. Theuse of force has been -- and remains -- our last resort. Yet all can know, friend and foe alike,that our nation has a mission: We will answer threats to our security, and we will defend thepeace.Our mission continues. Al Qaeda is wounded, not destroyed. The scattered cells of theterrorist network still operate in many nations, and we know from daily intelligence that theycontinue to plot against free people. The proliferation of deadly weapons remains a seriousdanger. The enemies of freedom are not idle, and neither are we. Our government has takenunprecedented measures to defend the homeland. And we will continue to hunt down theenemy before he can strike.The war on terror is not over; yet it is not endless. We do not know the day of final victory,but we have seen the turning of the tide. No act of the terrorists will change our purpose, orweaken our resolve, or alter their fate. Their cause is lost. Free nations will press on tovictory.Other nations in history have fought in foreign lands and remained to occupy and exploit.Americans, following a battle, want nothing more than to return home. And that is yourdirection tonight. After service in the Afghan -- and Iraqi theaters of war -- after 100,000miles, on the longest carrier deployment in recent history, you are homeward bound. Some ofyou will see new family members for the first time -- 150 babies were born while their fatherswere on the Lincoln. Your families are proud of you, and your nation will welcome you.We are mindful, as well, that some good men and women are not making the journey home.One of those who fell, Corporal Jason Mileo, spoke to his parents five days before his death.Jason's father said, ""He called us from the center of Baghdad, not to brag, but to tell us heloved us. Our son was a soldier."" Every name, every life is a loss to our military, to our nation,and to the loved ones who grieve. There's no homecoming for these families. Yet we pray, inGod's time, their reunion will come. Those we lost were last seen on duty. Their final act on this Earth was to fight a great evil andbring liberty to others. All of you -- all in this generation of our military -- have taken up thehighest calling of history. You're defending your country, and protecting the innocent fromharm. And wherever you go, you carry a message of hope -- a message that is ancient andever new. In the words of the prophet Isaiah, ""To the captives, 'come out,' -- and to those indarkness, 'be free.'"" Thank you for serving our country and our cause. May God bless you all, and may Godcontinue to bless America.",bush
"Mr. Secretary General; Mr. President; distinguished delegates; ladies and gentlemen: Twenty-four months ago -- and yesterday in the memory of America -- the center of New York Citybecame a battlefield, and a graveyard, and the symbol of an unfinished war. Since that day,terrorists have struck in Bali, Mombassa, in Casablanca, in Riyadh, in Jakarta, in Jerusalem --measuring the advance of their cause in the chaos and innocent suffering they leave behind. Last month, terrorists brought their war to the United Nations itself. The U.N. headquarters inBaghdad stood for order and compassion -- and for that reason, the terrorists decided it mustbe destroyed. Among the 22 people who were murdered was Sergio Vieira de Mello. Over thedecades, this good and brave man from Brazil gave help to the afflicted in Bangladesh,Cyprus, Mozambique, Lebanon, Cambodia, Central Africa, Kosovo, and East Timor, and wasaiding the people of Iraq in their time of need. America joins you, his colleagues, in honoringthe memory of Senor Vieira de Mello, and the memory of all who died with him in the serviceto the United Nations.By the victims they choose, and by the means they use, the terrorists have clarified thestruggle we are in. Those who target relief workers for death have set themselves against allhumanity. Those who incite murder and celebrate suicide reveal their contempt for life, itself.They have no place in any religious faith; they have no claim on the world's sympathy; andthey should have no friend in this chamber. Events during the past two years have set before us the clearest of divides: between thosewho seek order, and those who spread chaos; between those who work for peaceful change,and those who adopt the methods of gangsters; between those who honor the rights of man,and those who deliberately take the lives of men and women and children without mercy orshame. Between these alternatives there is no neutral ground. All governments that support terror arecomplicit in a war against civilization. No government should ignore the threat of terror,because to look the other way gives terrorists the chance to regroup and recruit and prepare.And all nations that fight terror, as if the lives of their own people depend on it, will earn thefavorable judgment of history. The former regimes of Afghanistan and Iraq knew these alternatives, and made their choices.The Taliban was a sponsor and servant of terrorism. When confronted, that regime chosedefiance, and that regime is no more. Afghanistan's President, who is here today, nowrepresents a free people who are building a decent and just society; they're building a nationfully joined in the war against terror. The regime of Saddam Hussein cultivated ties to terror while it built weapons of massdestruction. It used those weapons in acts of mass murder, and refused to account for themwhen confronted by the world. The Security Council was right to be alarmed. The SecurityCouncil was right to demand that Iraq destroy its illegal weapons and prove that it had doneso. The Security Council was right to vow serious consequences if Iraq refused to comply. Andbecause there were consequences, because a coalition of nations acted to defend the peace,and the credibility of the United Nations, Iraq is free, and today we are joined byrepresentatives of a liberated country.Saddam Hussein's monuments have been removed and not only his statues. The truemonuments of his rule and his character -- the torture chambers, and the rape rooms, and theprison cells for innocent children -- are closed. And as we discover the killing fields and massgraves of Iraq, the true scale of Saddam's cruelty is being revealed. The Iraqi people are meeting hardships and challenges, like every nation that has set out onthe path of democracy. Yet their future promises lives of dignity and freedom, and that is aworld away from the squalid, vicious tyranny they have known. Across Iraq, life is beingimproved by liberty. Across the Middle East, people are safer because an unstable aggressorhas been removed from power. Across the world, nations are more secure because an ally ofterror has fallen. Our actions in Afghanistan and Iraq were supported by many governments, and America isgrateful to each one. I also recognize that some of the sovereign nations of this assemblydisagreed with our actions. Yet there was, and there remains, unity among us on thefundamental principles and objectives of the United Nations. We are dedicated to the defenseof our collective security, and to the advance of human rights. These permanent commitmentscall us to great work in the world, work we must do together. So let us move forward. First, we must stand with the people of Afghanistan and Iraq as they build free and stablecountries. The terrorists and their allies fear and fight this progress above all, because freepeople embrace hope over resentment, and choose peace over violence. The United Nations has been a friend of the Afghan people, distributing food and medicine,helping refugees return home, advising on a new constitution, and helping to prepare the wayfor nationwide elections. NATO has taken over the U.N.-mandated security force in Kabul.American and coalition forces continue to track and defeat al Qaeda terrorists and remnants ofthe Taliban. Our efforts to rebuild that country go on. I have recently proposed to spend anadditional $1.2 billion for the Afghan reconstruction effort, and I urge other nations tocontinue contributing to this important cause. In the nation of Iraq, the United Nations is carrying out vital and effective work every day. Bythe end of 2004, more than 90 percent of Iraqi children under age five will have beenimmunized against preventable diseases such as polio, tuberculosis and measles, thanks tothe hard work and high ideals of UNICEF.Iraq's food distribution system is operational, delivering nearly a half-million tons of food permonth, thanks to the skill and expertise of the World Food Program. Our international coalition in Iraq is meeting it responsibilities. We are conducting precisionraids against terrorists and holdouts of the former regime. These killers are at war with theIraqi people. They have made Iraq the central front in the war on terror, and they will bedefeated. Our coalition has made sure that Iraq's former dictator will never again useweapons of mass destruction. We are interviewing Iraqi citizens and analyzing records of theold regime to reveal the full extent of its weapons programs and its long campaign ofdeception. We're training Iraqi police and border guards and a new army, so the Iraqi peoplecan assume full responsibility for their own security. And at the same time, our coalition is helping to improve the daily lives of the Iraqi people.The old regime built palaces while letting schools decay, so we are rebuilding more than athousand schools. The old regime starved hospitals of resources, so we have helped to supplyand reopen hospitals across Iraq. The old regime built up armies and weapons, while allowingthe nation's infrastructure to crumble, so we are rehabilitating power plants, water andsanitation facilities, bridges and airports. I proposed to Congress that the United Statesprovide additional funding for our work in Iraq, the greatest financial commitment of its kindsince the Marshall Plan. Having helped to liberate Iraq, we will honor our pledges to Iraq, andby helping the Iraqi people build a stable and peaceful country, we will make our owncountries more secure. The primary goal of our coalition in Iraq is self-government for the people of Iraq, reached byorderly and democratic process. This process must unfold according to the needs of Iraqis,neither hurried, nor delayed by the wishes of other parties. And the United Nations cancontribute greatly to the cause of Iraq self-government. America is working with friends andallies on a new Security Council resolution, which will expand the U.N.'s role in Iraq. As in theaftermath of other conflicts, the United Nations should assist in developing a constitution, intraining civil servants, and conducting free and fair elections. Iraq now has a Governing Council, the first truly representative institution in that country.Iraq's new leaders are showing the openness and tolerance that democracy requires, andthey're also showing courage.Yet every young democracy needs the help of friends. Now the nation of Iraq needs anddeserves our aid, and all nations of goodwill should step forward and provide that support. The success of a free Iraq will be watched and noted throughout the region. Millions will seethat freedom, equality, and material progress are possible at the heart of the Middle East.Leaders in the region will face the clearest evidence that free institutions and open societiesare the only path to long-term national success and dignity. And a transformed Middle Eastwould benefit the entire world, by undermining the ideologies that export violence to otherlands. Iraq as a dictatorship had great power to destabilize the Middle East; Iraq as a democracy willhave great power to inspire the Middle East. The advance of democratic institutions in Iraq issetting an example that others, including the Palestinian people, would be wise to follow. ThePalestinian cause is betrayed by leaders who cling to power by feeding old hatreds anddestroying the good work of others. The Palestinian people deserve their own state, and theywill gain that state by embracing new leaders committed to reform, to fighting terror, and tobuilding peace. All parties in the Middle East must meet their responsibilities and carry out thecommitments they made at Aqaba. Israel must work to create the conditions that will allow apeaceful Palestinian state to emerge. And Arab nations must cut off funding and other supportfor terrorist organizations. America will work with every nation in the region that acts boldlyfor the sake of peace. A second challenge we must confront together is the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction. Outlaw regimes that possess nuclear, chemical and biological weapons -- and themeans to deliver them -- would be able to use blackmail and create chaos in entire regions.These weapons could be used by terrorists to bring sudden disaster and suffering on a scalewe can scarcely imagine. The deadly combination of outlaw regimes and terror networks andweapons of mass murder is a peril that cannot be ignored or wished away. If such a danger isallowed to fully materialize, all words, all protests, will come too late. Nations of the worldmust have the wisdom and the will to stop grave threats before they arrive. One crucial step is to secure the most dangerous materials at their source. For more than adecade, the United States has worked with Russia and other states of the former Soviet Unionto dismantle, destroy, or secure weapons and dangerous materials left over from another era.Last year in Canada, the G8 nations agreed to provide up to $20 billion -- half of it from theUnited States -- to fight this proliferation risk over the next 10 years. Since then, sixadditional countries have joined the effort. More are needed, and I urge other nations to helpus meet this danger. We're also improving our capability to interdict lethal materials in transit. Through ourProliferation Security Initiative, 11 nations are preparing to search planes and ships, trainsand trucks carrying suspect cargo, and to seize weapons or missile shipments that raiseproliferation concerns. These nations have agreed on a set of interdiction principles, consistentwith legal -- current legal authorities. And we're working to expand the Proliferation SecurityInitiative to other countries. We're determined to keep the world's most destructive weaponsaway from all our shores, and out of the hands of our common enemies. Because proliferators will use any route or channel that is open to them, we need the broadestpossible cooperation to stop them. Today, I ask the U.N. Security Council to adopt a new anti-proliferation resolution. This resolution should call on all members of the U.N. to criminalizethe proliferation of weapons -- weapons of mass destruction, to enact strict export controlsconsistent with international standards, and to secure any and all sensitive materials withintheir own borders. The United States stands ready to help any nation draft these new laws,and to assist in their enforcement. A third challenge we share is a challenge to our conscience. We must act decisively to meetthe humanitarian crises of our time. The United States has begun to carry out the EmergencyPlan for AIDS Relief, aimed at preventing AIDS on a massive scale, and treating millions whohave the disease already. We have pledged $15 billion over five years to fight AIDS aroundthe world. My country is acting to save lives from famine, as well. We're providing more than $1.4 billionin global emergency food aid, and I've asked our United States Congress for $200 million for anew famine fund, so we can act quickly when the first signs of famine appear. Every nation onevery continent should generously add their resources to the fight against disease anddesperate hunger.There's another humanitarian crisis spreading, yet hidden from view. Each year, an estimated800,000 to 900,000 human beings are bought, sold or forced across the world's borders.Among them are hundreds of thousands of teenage girls, and others as young as five, who fallvictim to the sex trade. This commerce in human life generates billions of dollars each year --much of which is used to finance organized crime. There's a special evil in the abuse and exploitation of the most innocent and vulnerable. Thevictims of sex trade see little of life before they see the very worst of life -- an underground ofbrutality and lonely fear. Those who create these victims and profit from their suffering mustbe severely punished. Those who patronize this industry debase themselves and deepen themisery of others. And governments that tolerate this trade are tolerating a form of slavery. This problem has appeared in my own country, and we are working to stop it. The PROTECTAct, which I signed into law this year, makes it a crime for any person to enter the UnitedStates, or for any citizen to travel abroad, for the purpose of sex tourism involving children.The Department of Justice is actively investigating sex tour operators and patrons, who canface up to 30 years in prison. Under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, the United States isusing sanctions against governments to discourage human trafficking. The victims of this industry also need help from members of the United Nations. And thisbegins with clear standards and the certainty of punishment under laws of every country.Today, some nations make it a crime to sexually abuse children abroad. Such conduct shouldbe a crime in all nations. Governments should inform travelers of the harm this industry does,and the severe punishments that will fall on its patrons. The American government iscommitting $50 million to support the good work of organizations that are rescuing womenand children from exploitation, and giving them shelter and medical treatment and the hopeof a new life. I urge other governments to do their part. We must show new energy in fighting back an old evil. Nearly two centuries after the abolitionof the transatlantic slave trade, and more than a century after slavery was officially ended inits last strongholds, the trade in human beings for any purpose must not be allowed to thrivein our time.All the challenges I have spoken of this morning require urgent attention and moral clarity.Helping Afghanistan and Iraq to succeed as free nations in a transformed region, cutting offthe avenues of proliferation, abolishing modern forms of slavery -- these are the kinds ofgreat tasks for which the United Nations was founded. In each case, careful discussion isneeded, and also decisive action. Our good intentions will be credited only if we achieve goodoutcomes. As an original signer of the U.N. Charter, the United States of America is committed to theUnited Nations. And we show that commitment by working to fulfill the U.N.'s statedpurposes, and give meaning to its ideals. The founding documents of the United Nations andthe founding documents of America stand in the same tradition. Both assert that humanbeings should never be reduced to objects of power or commerce, because their dignity isinherent. Both require -- both recognize a moral law that stands above men and nations,which must be defended and enforced by men and nations. And both point the way to peace,the peace that comes when all are free. We secure that peace with our courage, and we mustshow that courage together. May God bless you all.",bush

By speaking for and standing for freedom, you'velifted the hopes of people around the world, and you've brought great credit to America.  I appreciate Vin for the short introduction. I'm a man who likes short introductions. And hedidn't let me down. But more importantly, I appreciate the invitation. I appreciate themembers of Congress who are here, senators from both political parties, members of theHouse of Representatives from both political parties. I appreciate the ambassadors who arehere. I appreciate the guests who have come. I appreciate the bipartisan spirit, thenonpartisan spirit of the National Endowment for Democracy. I'm glad that Republicans andDemocrats and independents are working together to advance human liberty. The roots of our democracy can be traced to England, and to its Parliament -- and so can theroots of this organization. In June of 1982, President Ronald Reagan spoke at WestminsterPalace and declared, the turning point had arrived in history. He argued that Sovietcommunism had failed, precisely because it did not respect its own people -- their creativity,their genius and their rights.President Reagan said that the day of Soviet tyranny was passing, that freedom had amomentum which would not be halted. He gave this organization its mandate: to add to themomentum of freedom across the world. Your mandate was important 20 years ago; it isequally important today. A number of critics were dismissive of that speech by the President. According to one editorialof the time, ""It seems hard to be a sophisticated European and also an admirer of RonaldReagan."" Some observers on both sides of the Atlantic pronounced the speech simplistic andnaive, and even dangerous. In fact, Ronald Reagan's words were courageous and optimisticand entirely correct. The great democratic movement President Reagan described was already well underway. Inthe early 1970s, there were about 40 democracies in the world. By the middle of that decade,Portugal and Spain and Greece held free elections. Soon there were new democracies in LatinAmerica, and free institutions were spreading in Korea, in Taiwan, and in East Asia. This veryweek in 1989, there were protests in East Berlin and in Leipzig. By the end of that year, everycommunist dictatorship in Central America* had collapsed. Within another year, the SouthAfrican government released Nelson Mandela. Four years later, he was elected president of hiscountry -- ascending, like Walesa and Havel, from prisoner of state to head of state. As the 20th century ended, there were around 120 democracies in the world -- and I canassure you more are on the way. Ronald Reagan would be pleased, and he would not besurprised. We've witnessed, in little over a generation, the swiftest advance of freedom in the 2,500 yearstory of democracy. Historians in the future will offer their own explanations for why thishappened. Yet we already know some of the reasons they will cite. It is no accident that therise of so many democracies took place in a time when the world's most influential nation wasitself a democracy. The United States made military and moral commitments in Europe and Asia, which protectedfree nations from aggression, and created the conditions in which new democracies couldflourish. As we provided security for whole nations, we also provided inspiration for oppressedpeoples. In prison camps, in banned union meetings, in clandestine churches, men andwomen knew that the whole world was not sharing their own nightmare. They knew of at leastone place -- a bright and hopeful land -- where freedom was valued and secure. And theyprayed that America would not forget them, or forget the mission to promote liberty aroundthe world. Historians will note that in many nations, the advance of markets and free enterprise helpedto create a middle class that was confident enough to demand their own rights. They will pointto the role of technology in frustrating censorship and central control -- and marvel at thepower of instant communications to spread the truth, the news, and courage across borders.Historians in the future will reflect on an extraordinary, undeniable fact: Over time, freenations grow stronger and dictatorships grow weaker. In the middle of the 20th century, someimagined that the central planning and social regimentation were a shortcut to nationalstrength. In fact, the prosperity, and social vitality and technological progress of a people aredirectly determined by extent of their liberty. Freedom honors and unleashes human creativity-- and creativity determines the strength and wealth of nations. Liberty is both the plan ofHeaven for humanity, and the best hope for progress here on Earth. The progress of liberty is a powerful trend. Yet, we also know that liberty, if not defended, canbe lost. The success of freedom is not determined by some dialectic of history. By definition,the success of freedom rests upon the choices and the courage of free peoples, and upon theirwillingness to sacrifice. In the trenches of World War I, through a two-front war in the 1940s,the difficult battles of Korea and Vietnam, and in missions of rescue and liberation on nearlyevery continent, Americans have amply displayed our willingness to sacrifice for liberty. The sacrifices of Americans have not always been recognized or appreciated, yet they havebeen worthwhile. Because we and our allies were steadfast, Germany and Japan aredemocratic nations that no longer threaten the world. A global nuclear standoff with theSoviet Union ended peacefully -- as did the Soviet Union. The nations of Europe are movingtowards unity, not dividing into armed camps and descending into genocide. Every nation haslearned, or should have learned, an important lesson: Freedom is worth fighting for, dying for,and standing for -- and the advance of freedom leads to peace. And now we must apply that lesson in our own time. We've reached another great turningpoint -- and the resolve we show will shape the next stage of the world democraticmovement. Our commitment to democracy is tested in countries like Cuba and Burma and North Koreaand Zimbabwe -- outposts of oppression in our world. The people in these nations live incaptivity, and fear and silence. Yet, these regimes cannot hold back freedom forever -- and,one day, from prison camps and prison cells, and from exile, the leaders of new democracieswill arrive. Communism, and militarism and rule by the capricious and corrupt are the relics ofa passing era. And we will stand with these oppressed peoples until the day of their freedomfinally arrives. Our commitment to democracy is tested in China. That nation now has a sliver, a fragment ofliberty. Yet, China's people will eventually want their liberty pure and whole. China hasdiscovered that economic freedom leads to national wealth. China's leaders will also discoverthat freedom is indivisible -- that social and religious freedom is also essential to nationalgreatness and national dignity. Eventually, men and women who are allowed to control theirown wealth will insist on controlling their own lives and their own country.Our commitment to democracy is also tested in the Middle East, which is my focus today, andmust be a focus of American policy for decades to come. In many nations of the Middle East --countries of great strategic importance -- democracy has not yet taken root. And thequestions arise: Are the peoples of the Middle East somehow beyond the reach of liberty? Aremillions of men and women and children condemned by history or culture to live indespotism? Are they alone never to know freedom, and never even to have a choice in thematter? I, for one, do not believe it. I believe every person has the ability and the right to befree. Some skeptics of democracy assert that the traditions of Islam are inhospitable to therepresentative government. This ""cultural condescension,"" as Ronald Reagan termed it, has along history. After the Japanese surrender in 1945, a so-called Japan expert asserted thatdemocracy in that former empire would ""never work."" Another observer declared theprospects for democracy in post-Hitler Germany are, and I quote, ""most uncertain at best"" --he made that claim in 1957. Seventy-four years ago, The Sunday London Times declarednine-tenths of the population of India to be ""illiterates not caring a fig for politics."" Yet whenIndian democracy was imperiled in the 1970s, the Indian people showed their commitment toliberty in a national referendum that saved their form of government. Time after time, observers have questioned whether this country, or that people, or thisgroup, are ""ready"" for democracy -- as if freedom were a prize you win for meeting our ownWestern standards of progress. In fact, the daily work of democracy itself is the path ofprogress. It teaches cooperation, the free exchange of ideas, and the peaceful resolution ofdifferences. As men and women are showing, from Bangladesh to Botswana, to Mongolia, it isthe practice of democracy that makes a nation ready for democracy, and every nation canstart on this path. It should be clear to all that Islam -- the faith of one-fifth of humanity -- is consistent withdemocratic rule. Democratic progress is found in many predominantly Muslim countries -- inTurkey and Indonesia, and Senegal and Albania, Niger and Sierra Leone. Muslim men andwomen are good citizens of India and South Africa, of the nations of Western Europe, and ofthe United States of America. More than half of all the Muslims in the world live in freedom under democratically constitutedgovernments. They succeed in democratic societies, not in spite of their faith, but because ofit. A religion that demands individual moral accountability, and encourages the encounter ofthe individual with God, is fully compatible with the rights and responsibilities of self-government. Yet there's a great challenge today in the Middle East. In the words of a recent report by Arabscholars, the global wave of democracy has -- and I quote -- ""barely reached the Arab states.""They continue: ""This freedom deficit undermines human development and is one of the mostpainful manifestations of lagging political development.""The freedom deficit they describe has terrible consequences, of the people of the Middle Eastand for the world. In many Middle Eastern countries, poverty is deep and it is spreading,women lack rights and are denied schooling. Whole societies remain stagnant while the worldmoves ahead. These are not the failures of a culture or a religion. These are the failures ofpolitical and economic doctrines. As the colonial era passed away, the Middle East saw the establishment of many militarydictatorships. Some rulers adopted the dogmas of socialism, seized total control of politicalparties and the media and universities. They allied themselves with the Soviet bloc and withinternational terrorism. Dictators in Iraq and Syria promised the restoration of national honor,a return to ancient glories. They've left instead a legacy of torture, oppression, misery, andruin. Other men, and groups of men, have gained influence in the Middle East and beyond throughan ideology of theocratic terror. Behind their language of religion is the ambition for absolutepolitical power. Ruling cabals like the Taliban show their version of religious piety in publicwhippings of women, ruthless suppression of any difference or dissent, and support forterrorists who arm and train to murder the innocent. The Taliban promised religious purity andnational pride. Instead, by systematically destroying a proud and working society, they leftbehind suffering and starvation. Many Middle Eastern governments now understand that military dictatorship and theocraticrule are a straight, smooth highway to nowhere. But some governments still cling to the oldhabits of central control. There are governments that still fear and repress independentthought and creativity, and private enterprise -- the human qualities that make for a -- strongand successful societies. Even when these nations have vast natural resources, they do notrespect or develop their greatest resources -- the talent and energy of men and womenworking and living in freedom. Instead of dwelling on past wrongs and blaming others, governments in the Middle East needto confront real problems, and serve the true interests of their nations. The good and capablepeople of the Middle East all deserve responsible leadership. For too long, many people in thatregion have been victims and subjects -- they deserve to be active citizens. Governments across the Middle East and North Africa are beginning to see the need forchange. Morocco has a diverse new parliament; King Mohammed has urged it to extend therights to women. Here is how His Majesty explained his reforms to parliament: ""How cansociety achieve progress while women, who represent half the nation, see their rights violatedand suffer as a result of injustice, violence, and marginalization, notwithstanding the dignityand justice granted to them by our glorious religion?"" The King of Morocco is correct: Thefuture of Muslim nations will be better for all with the full participation of women.In Bahrain last year, citizens elected their own parliament for the first time in nearly threedecades. Oman has extended the vote to all adult citizens; Qatar has a new constitution;Yemen has a multiparty political system; Kuwait has a directly elected national assembly; andJordan held historic elections this summer. Recent surveys in Arab nations reveal broadsupport for political pluralism, the rule of law, and free speech. These are the stirrings ofMiddle Eastern democracy, and they carry the promise of greater change to come. As changes come to the Middle Eastern region, those with power should ask themselves: Willthey be remembered for resisting reform, or for leading it? In Iran, the demand for democracyis strong and broad, as we saw last month when thousands gathered to welcome home ShirinEbadi, the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. The regime in Teheran must heed the democraticdemands of the Iranian people, or lose its last claim to legitimacy. For the Palestinian people, the only path to independence and dignity and progress is the pathof democracy. And the Palestinian leaders who block and undermine democratic reform, andfeed hatred and encourage violence are not leaders at all. They're the main obstacles topeace, and to the success of the Palestinian people. The Saudi government is taking first steps toward reform, including a plan for gradualintroduction of elections. By giving the Saudi people a greater role in their own society, theSaudi government can demonstrate true leadership in the region. The great and proud nation of Egypt has shown the way toward peace in the Middle East, andnow should show the way toward democracy in the Middle East. Champions of democracy inthe region understand that democracy is not perfect, it is not the path to utopia, but it's theonly path to national success and dignity. As we watch and encourage reforms in the region, we are mindful that modernization is notthe same as Westernization. Representative governments in the Middle East will reflect theirown cultures. They will not, and should not, look like us. Democratic nations may beconstitutional monarchies, federal republics, or parliamentary systems. And workingdemocracies always need time to develop -- as did our own. We've taken a 200-year journeytoward inclusion and justice -- and this makes us patient and understanding as other nationsare at different stages of this journey. There are, however, essential principles common to every successful society, in every culture.Successful societies limit the power of the state and the power of the military -- so thatgovernments respond to the will of the people, and not the will of an elite. Successful societiesprotect freedom with the consistent and impartial rule of law, instead of selecting applying --selectively applying the law to punish political opponents. Successful societies allow room forhealthy civic institutions -- for political parties and labor unions and independent newspapersand broadcast media. Successful societies guarantee religious liberty -- the right to serve andhonor God without fear of persecution. Successful societies privatize their economies, andsecure the rights of property.They prohibit and punish official corruption, and invest in the health and education of theirpeople. They recognize the rights of women. And instead of directing hatred and resentmentagainst others, successful societies appeal to the hopes of their own people. These vital principles are being applies in the nations of Afghanistan and Iraq. With the steadyleadership of President Karzai, the people of Afghanistan are building a modern and peacefulgovernment. Next month, 500 delegates will convene a national assembly in Kabul to approvea new Afghan constitution. The proposed draft would establish a bicameral parliament, setnational elections next year, and recognize Afghanistan's Muslim identity, while protecting therights of all citizens. Afghanistan faces continuing economic and security challenges -- it willface those challenges as a free and stable democracy. In Iraq, the Coalition Provisional Authority and the Iraqi Governing Council are also workingtogether to build a democracy -- and after three decades of tyranny, this work is not easy.The former dictator ruled by terror and treachery, and left deeply ingrained habits of fear anddistrust. Remnants of his regime, joined by foreign terrorists, continue their battle againstorder and against civilization. Our coalition is responding to recent attacks with precisionraids, guided by intelligence provided by the Iraqis, themselves. And we're working closelywith Iraqi citizens as they prepare a constitution, as they move toward free elections and takeincreasing responsibility for their own affairs. As in the defense of Greece in 1947, and later inthe Berlin Airlift, the strength and will of free peoples are now being tested before a watchingworld. And we will meet this test. Securing democracy in Iraq is the work of many hands. American and coalition forces aresacrificing for the peace of Iraq and for the security of free nations. Aid workers from manycountries are facing danger to help the Iraqi people. The National Endowment for Democracyis promoting women's rights, and training Iraqi journalists, and teaching the skills of politicalparticipation. Iraqis, themselves -- police and borders guards and local officials -- are joiningin the work and they are sharing in the sacrifice. This is a massive and difficult undertaking -- it is worth our effort, it is worth our sacrifice,because we know the stakes. The failure of Iraqi democracy would embolden terrorists aroundthe world, increase dangers to the American people, and extinguish the hopes of millions inthe region. Iraqi democracy will succeed -- and that success will send forth the news, fromDamascus to Teheran -- that freedom can be the future of every nation. The establishment ofa free Iraq at the heart of the Middle East will be a watershed event in the global democraticrevolution. Sixty years of Western nations excusing and accommodating the lack of freedom in the MiddleEast did nothing to make us safe -- because in the long run, stability cannot be purchased atthe expense of liberty. As long as the Middle East remains a place where freedom does notflourish, it will remain a place of stagnation, resentment, and violence ready for export. Andwith the spread of weapons that can bring catastrophic harm to our country and to ourfriends, it would be reckless to accept the status quo.Therefore, the United States has adopted a new policy, a forward strategy of freedom in theMiddle East. This strategy requires the same persistence and energy and idealism we haveshown before. And it will yield the same results. As in Europe, as in Asia, as in every region ofthe world, the advance of freedom leads to peace. The advance of freedom is the calling of our time; it is the calling of our country. From theFourteen Points to the Four Freedoms, to the Speech at Westminster, America has put ourpower at the service of principle. We believe that liberty is the design of nature; we believethat liberty is the direction of history. We believe that human fulfillment and excellence comein the responsible exercise of liberty. And we believe that freedom -- the freedom we prize --is not for us alone, it is the right and the capacity of all mankind. Working for the spread of freedom can be hard. Yet, America has accomplished hard tasksbefore. Our nation is strong; we're strong of heart. And we're not alone. Freedom is findingallies in every country; freedom finds allies in every culture. And as we meet the terror andviolence of the world, we can be certain the author of freedom is not indifferent to the fate offreedom. With all the tests and all the challenges of our age, this is, above all, the age of liberty. Eachof you at this Endowment is fully engaged in the great cause of liberty. And I thank you.May God bless your work. And may God continue to bless America.",bush
"Thank you very much.Secretary Straw and Secretary Hoon; Admiral Cobbald and Dr. Chipman; distinguishedguests: I want to thank you for your very kind welcome that you've given to me and to Laura.I also thank the groups hosting this event -- The Royal United Services Institute, and theInternational Institute for Strategic Studies. We're honored to be in the United Kingdom, andwe bring the good wishes of the American people.It was pointed out to me that the last noted American to visit London stayed in a glass boxdangling over the Thames. A few might have been happy to provide similar arrangements forme. I thank Her Majesty the Queen for interceding. We're honored to be staying at her house.Americans traveling to England always observe more similarities to our country thandifferences. I've been here only a short time, but I've noticed that the tradition of free speech-- exercised with enthusiasm -- is alive and well here in London. We have that at home, too.They now have that right in Baghdad, as well.The people of Great Britain also might see some familiar traits in Americans. We're sometimesfaulted for a naive faith that liberty can change the world. If that's an error it began withreading too much John Locke and Adam Smith. Americans have, on occasion, been calledmoralists who often speak in terms of right and wrong. That zeal has been inspired byexamples on this island, by the tireless compassion of Lord Shaftesbury, the righteouscourage of Wilberforce, and the firm determination of the Royal Navy over the decades tofight and end the trade in slaves.It's rightly said that Americans are a religious people. That's, in part, because of the ""GoodNews"" was translated by Tyndale, preached by Wesley, lived out in the example of WilliamBooth. At times, Americans are even said to have a puritan streak. And where might that havecome from? Well, we can start with the Puritans.To this fine heritage, Americans have added a few traits of our own: the good influence of ourimmigrants, the spirit of the frontier. Yet, there remains a bit of England in every American.So much of our national character comes from you, and we're glad for it.The fellowship of generations is the cause of common beliefs. We believe in open societiesordered by moral conviction. We believe in private markets, humanized by compassionategovernment. We believe in economies that reward effort, communities that protect the weak,and the duty of nations to respect the dignity and the rights of all. And whether one learnsthese ideals in County Durham or in West Texas, they instill mutual respect and they inspirecommon purpose. More than an alliance of security and commerce, the British and Americanpeoples have an alliance of values. And, today, this old and tested alliance is very strong.The deepest beliefs of our nations set the direction of our foreign policy. We value our owncivil rights, so we stand for the human rights of others. We affirm the God-given dignity ofevery person, so we are moved to action by poverty and oppression and famine and disease.The United States and Great Britain share a mission in the world beyond the balance of poweror the simple pursuit of interest. We seek the advance of freedom and the peace that freedombrings. Together our nations are standing and sacrificing for this high goal in a distant land atthis very hour. And America honors the idealism and the bravery of the sons and daughters ofBritain.The last President to stay at Buckingham Palace was an idealist, without question. At a dinnerhosted by King George V, in 1918, Woodrow Wilson made a pledge; with typical Americanunderstatement, he vowed that right and justice would become the predominant andcontrolling force in the world.President Wilson had come to Europe with his 14 Points for Peace. Many complimented him onhis vision; yet some were dubious. Take, for example, the Prime Minister of France. Hecomplained that God, himself, had only 10 commandments. Sounds familiar.At Wilson's high point of idealism, however, Europe was one short generation from Munichand Auschwitz and the Blitz. Looking back, we see the reasons why. The League of Nations,lacking both credibility and will, collapsed at the first challenge of the dictators. Free nationsfailed to recognize, much less confront, the aggressive evil in plain sight. And so, dictatorswent about their business, feeding resentments and anti-Semitism, bringing death to innocentpeople in this city and across the world, and filling the last century with violence andgenocide.Through world war and cold war, we learned that idealism, if it is to do any good in this world,requires common purpose and national strength, moral courage and patience in difficult tasks.And now our generation has need of these qualities. On September the 11th, 2001, terrorists left their mark of murder on my country, and tookthe lives of 67 British citizens. With the passing of months and years, it is the natural humandesire to resume a quiet life and to put that day behind us, as if waking from a dark dream.The hope that danger has passed is comforting, is understanding, and it is false. The attacksthat followed -- on Bali, Jakarta, Casablanca, Bombay, Mombassa, Najaf, Jerusalem, Riyadh,Baghdad, and Istanbul -- were not dreams. They're part of a global campaign by terroristnetworks to intimidate and demoralize all who oppose them.These terrorists target the innocent, and they kill by the thousands. And they would, if theygain the weapons they seek, kill by the millions and not be finished. The greatest threat of ourage is nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons in the hands of terrorists, and the dictatorswho aid them. The evil is in plain sight. The danger only increases with denial. Greatresponsibilities fall once again to the great democracies. We will face these threats with openeyes, and we will defeat them.The peace and security of free nations now rests on three pillars: First, internationalorganizations must be equal to the challenges facing our world, from lifting up failing states toopposing proliferation.Like 11 Presidents before me, I believe in the international institutions and alliances thatAmerica helped to form and helps to lead. The United States and Great Britain have laboredhard to help make the United Nations what it is supposed to be -- an effective instrument ofour collective security. In recent months, we've sought and gained three additional resolutionson Iraq -- Resolutions 1441, 1483, and 1511 -- precisely because the global danger of terrordemands a global response. The United Nations has no more compelling advocate than yourPrime Minister, who at every turn has championed its ideals and appealed to its authority. Heunderstands, as well, that the credibility of the U.N. depends on a willingness to keep its wordand to act when action is required.America and Great Britain have done, and will do, all in their power to prevent the UnitedNations from solemnly choosing its own irrelevance and inviting the fate of the League ofNations. It's not enough to meet the dangers of the world with resolutions; we must meetthose dangers with resolve.In this century, as in the last, nations can accomplish more together than apart. For 54 years,America has stood with our partners in NATO, the most effective multilateral institution inhistory. We're committed to this great democratic alliance, and we believe it must have thewill and the capacity to act beyond Europe where threats emerge.My nation welcomes the growing unity of Europe, and the world needs America and theEuropean Union to work in common purpose for the advance of security and justice. Americais cooperating with four other nations to meet the dangers posed by North Korea. Americabelieves the IAEA must be true to its purpose and hold Iran to its obligations.Our first choice, and our constant practice, is to work with other responsible governments. Weunderstand, as well, that the success of multilateralism is not measured by adherence toforms alone -- the tidiness of the process -- but by the results we achieve to keep our nationssecure.The second pillar of peace and security in our world is the willingness of free nations, whenthe last resort arrives, to retain* [sic] aggression and evil by force. There are principledobjections to the use of force in every generation, and I credit the good motives behind theseviews.Those in authority, however, are not judged only by good motivations. The people have givenus the duty to defend them. And that duty sometimes requires the violent restraint of violentmen. In some cases, the measured use of force is all that protects us from a chaotic worldruled by force.Most in the peaceful West have no living memory of that kind of world. Yet in some countries,the memories are recent: The victims of ethnic cleansing in the Balkans, those who survivedthe rapists and the death squads, have few qualms when NATO applied force to help endthose crimes. The women of Afghanistan, imprisoned in their homes and beaten in the streetsand executed in public spectacles, did not reproach us for routing the Taliban. The inhabitantsof Iraq's Baathist hell, with its lavish palaces and its torture chambers, with its massivestatutes** [sic] and its mass graves, do not miss their fugitive dictator. They rejoiced at hisfall.In all these cases, military action was proceeded by diplomatic initiatives and negotiations andultimatums, and final chances until the final moment. In Iraq, year after year, the dictator wasgiven the chance to account for his weapons programs, and end the nightmare for his people.Now, the resolutions he defied have been enforced.And who will say that Iraq was better off when Saddam Hussein was strutting and killing, orthat the world was safer when he held power? Who doubts that Afghanistan is a more justsociety and less dangerous without Mullah Omar playing host to terrorists from around theworld. And Europe, too, is plainly better off with Milosevic answering for his crimes, instead ofcommitting more.It's been said that those who live near a police station find it hard to believe in the triumph ofviolence. In the same way free peoples might be tempted to take for granted the orderlysocieties we have come to know. Europe's peaceful unity is one of the great achievements ofthe last half-century.And because European countries now resolve differences through negotiation and consensus,there's sometimes an assumption that the entire world functions in the same way. But let usnever forget how Europe's unity was achieved -- by allied armies of liberation and NATOarmies of defense. And let us never forget, beyond Europe's borders, in a world whereoppression and violence are very real, liberation is still a moral goal, and freedom and securitystill need defenders.The third pillar of security is our commitment to the global expansion of democracy, and thehope and progress it brings, as the alternative to instability and hatred and terror. We cannotrely exclusively on military power to assure our long-term security. Lasting peace is gained asjustice and democracy advance.In democratic and successful societies, men and women do not swear allegiance tomalcontents and murderers; they turn their hearts and labor to building better lives. Anddemocratic governments do not shelter terrorist camps or attack their peaceful neighbors;they honor the aspirations and dignity of their own people. In our conflict with terror andtyranny, we have an unmatched advantage, a power that cannot be resisted, and that is theappeal of freedom to all mankind.As global powers, both our nations serve the cause of freedom in many ways, in many places.By promoting development, and fighting famine and AIDS and other diseases, we're fulfillingour moral duties, as well as encouraging stability and building a firmer basis for democraticinstitutions. By working for justice in Burma, in the Sudan and in Zimbabwe, we give hope tosuffering people and improve the chances for stability and progress. By extending the reach oftrade we foster prosperity and the habits of liberty. And by advancing freedom in the greaterMiddle East, we help end a cycle of dictatorship and radicalism that brings millions to [sic]people to misery and brings danger to our own people.The stakes in that region could not be higher. If the Middle East remains a place wherefreedom does not flourish, it will remain a place of stagnation and anger and violence forexport. And as we saw in the ruins of two towers, no distance on the map will protect our livesand way of life. If the greater Middle East joins the democratic revolution that has reachedmuch of the world, the lives of millions in that region will be bettered, and a trend of conflictand fear will be ended at its source.The movement of history will not come about quickly. Because of our own democraticdevelopment -- the fact that it was gradual and, at times, turbulent -- we must be patientwith others. And the Middle East countries have some distance to travel.Arab scholars speak of a freedom deficit that has separated whole nations from the progressof our time. The essentials of social and material progress -- limited government, equal justiceunder law, religious and economic liberty, political participation, free press, and respect forthe rights of women -- have been scarce across the region. Yet that has begun to change. Inan arc of reform from Morocco to Jordan to Qatar, we are seeing elections and newprotections for women and the stirring of political pluralism. Many governments are realizingthat theocracy and dictatorship do not lead to national greatness; they end in national ruin.They are finding, as others will find, that national progress and dignity are achieved whengovernments are just and people are free.The democratic progress we've seen in the Middle East was not imposed from abroad, andneither will the greater progress we hope to see. Freedom, by definition, must be chosen, anddefended by those who choose it. Our part, as free nations, is to ally ourselves with reform,wherever it occurs.Perhaps the most helpful change we can make is to change in our own thinking. In the West,there's been a certain skepticism about the capacity or even the desire of Middle Easternpeoples for self-government. We're told that Islam is somehow inconsistent with a democraticculture. Yet more than half of the world's Muslims are today contributing citizens indemocratic societies. It is suggested that the poor, in their daily struggles, care little for self-government. Yet the poor, especially, need the power of democracy to defend themselvesagainst corrupt elites.Peoples of the Middle East share a high civilization, a religion of personal responsibility, and aneed for freedom as deep as our own. It is not realism to suppose that one-fifth of humanityis unsuited to liberty; it is pessimism and condescension, and we should have none of it.We must shake off decades of failed policy in the Middle East. Your nation and mine, in thepast, have been willing to make a bargain, to tolerate oppression for the sake of stability.Longstanding ties often led us to overlook the faults of local elites.Yet this bargain did not bring stability or make us safe. It merely bought time, while problemsfestered and ideologies of violence took hold.As recent history has shown, we cannot turn a blind eye to oppression just because theoppression is not in our own backyard. No longer should we think tyranny is benign because itis temporarily convenient. Tyranny is never benign to its victims, and our great democraciesshould oppose tyranny wherever it is found.Now we're pursuing a different course, a forward strategy of freedom in the Middle East. Wewill consistently challenge the enemies of reform and confront the allies of terror. We willexpect a higher standard from our friends in the region, and we will meet our responsibilitiesin Afghanistan and in Iraq by finishing the work of democracy we have begun.There were good-faith disagreements in your country and mine over the course and timing ofmilitary action in Iraq. Whatever has come before, we now have only two options: to keep ourword, or to break our word. The failure of democracy in Iraq would throw its people back intomisery and turn that country over to terrorists who wish to destroy us. Yet democracy willsucceed in Iraq, because our will is firm, our word is good, and the Iraqi people will notsurrender their freedom.Since the liberation of Iraq, we have seen changes that could hardly have been imagined ayear ago. A new Iraqi police force protects the people, instead of bullying them. More than150 Iraqi newspapers are now in circulation, printing what they choose, not what they'reordered. Schools are open, with textbooks free of propaganda. Hospitals are functioning andare well-supplied. Iraq has a new currency, the first battalion of a new army, representativelocal governments, and a Governing Council with an aggressive timetable for nationalsovereignty. This is substantial progress. And much of it has proceeded faster than similarefforts in Germany and Japan after World War II.Yet the violence we are seeing in Iraq today is serious. And it comes from Baathist holdoutsand Jihadists from other countries, and terrorists drawn to the prospect of innocentbloodshed. It is the nature of terrorism and the cruelty of a few to try to bring grief in the lossto many. The armed forces of both our countries have taken losses, felt deeply by ourcitizens. Some families now live with a burden of great sorrow. We cannot take the pain away.But these families can know they are not alone. We pray for their strength; we pray for theircomfort; and we will never forget the courage of the ones they loved.The terrorists have a purpose, a strategy to their cruelty. They view the rise of democracy inIraq as a powerful threat to their ambitions. In this, they are correct. They believe their actsof terror against our coalition, against international aid workers and against innocent Iraqis,will make us recoil and retreat. In this, they are mistaken.We did not charge hundreds of miles into the heart of Iraq and pay a bitter cost of casualties,and liberate 25 million people, only to retreat before a band of thugs and assassins. We willhelp the Iraqi people establish a peaceful and democratic country in the heart of the MiddleEast. And by doing so, we will defend our people from danger.The forward strategy of freedom must also apply to the Arab-Israeli conflict. It's a difficultperiod in a part of the world that has known many. Yet, our commitment remains firm. Weseek justice and dignity. We seek a viable, independent state for the Palestinian people, whohave been betrayed by others for too long. We seek security and recognition for the state ofIsrael, which has lived in the shadow of random death for too long. These are worthy goals inthemselves, and by reaching them we will also remove an occasion and excuse for hatred andviolence in the broader Middle East.Achieving peace in the Holy Land is not just a matter of the shape of a border. As we work onthe details of peace, we must look to the heart of the matter, which is the need for a viablePalestinian democracy. Peace will not be achieved by Palestinian rulers who intimidateopposition, who tolerate and profit from corruption and maintain their ties to terrorist groups.These are the methods of the old elites, who time and again had put their own self-interestabove the interest of the people they claim to serve. The long-suffering Palestinian peopledeserve better. They deserve true leaders, capable of creating and governing a Palestinianstate.Even after the setbacks and frustrations of recent months, goodwill and hard effort can bringabout a Palestinian state and a secure Israel. Those who would lead a new Palestine shouldadopt peaceful means to achieve the rights of their people and create the reformedinstitutions of a stable democracy.Israel should freeze settlement construction, dismantle unauthorized outposts, end the dailyhumiliation of the Palestinian people, and not prejudice final negotiations with the placementsof walls and fences.Arab states should end incitement in their own media, cut off public and private funding forterrorism, and establish normal relations with Israel.Leaders in Europe should withdraw all favor and support from any Palestinian ruler who failshis people and betrays their cause. And Europe's leaders -- and all leaders -- should stronglyoppose anti-Semitism, which poisons public debates over the future of the Middle East.Ladies and gentlemen, we have great objectives before us that make our Atlantic alliance asvital as it has ever been. We will encourage the strength and effectiveness of internationalinstitutions. We will use force when necessary in the defense of freedom. And we will raise upan ideal of democracy in every part of the world. On these three pillars we will build the peace and security of all free nations in a time ofdanger.So much good has come from our alliance of conviction and might. So much now depends onthe strength of this alliance as we go forward. America has always found strong partners inLondon, leaders of good judgment and blunt counsel and backbone when times are tough.And I have found all those qualities in your current Prime Minister, who has my respect andmy deepest thanks.The ties between our nations, however, are deeper than the relationship between leaders.These ties endure because they are formed by the experience and responsibilities andadversity we have shared. And in the memory of our peoples, there will always be oneexperience, one central event, when the seal was fixed on the friendship between Britain andthe United States: The arrival in Great Britain of more than 1.5 million American soldiers andairmen in the 1940s was a turning point in the second world war. For many Britons, it was afirst close look at Americans, other than in the movies. Some of you here today may stillremember the ""friendly invasion."" Our lads, they took some getting used to. There was even asaying about what many of them were up to -- in addition to being ""overpaid and over here.""At a reunion in North London some years ago, an American pilot who had settled in Englandafter his military service, said, ""Well, I'm still over here, and probably overpaid. So two out ofthree isn't bad.""In that time of war, the English people did get used to the Americans. They welcomed soldiersand fliers into their villages and homes, and took to calling them, ""our boys."" About 70,000 ofthose boys did their part to affirm our special relationship. They returned home with Englishbrides.Americans gained a certain image of Britain, as well. We saw an island threatened on everyside, a leader who did not waver, and a country of the firmest character. And that has notchanged. The British people are the sort of partners you want when serious work needs doin'.The men and women of this Kingdom are kind and steadfast and generous and brave. AndAmerica is fortunate to call this country our closest friend in the world.May God bless you all.",bush

"Good morning. Thank you all for coming. I take great joy in making this announcement. It'sgoing to be one of the most important initiatives that my Administration not only discusses,but implements. First, it's good to have so many groups represented here -- religious and non-religious;Catholic, Jewish, Protestant, and Muslim; foundations and other non-profits. I want to thankyou all for coming. This is a collection of some of the finest America has got to offer -- people who lead with theirhearts, and in turn, have changed the communities in which they live for the better. Thismeeting is a picture of the strength and diversity and compassion of our country. This is a diverse group, but we share things in common. We provide more than -- Theyprovide more than practical help to people in need. They touch and change hearts. And forthis, America is deeply appreciative.Everyone in this room knows firsthand that there are still deep needs and real suffering in theshadow of America's affluence. Problems like addiction and abandonment and gang violence,domestic violence, mental illness and homelessness. We are called by conscience to respond. As I said in my Inaugural Address, ""compassion is the work of a nation, not just agovernment."" It is more than the calling of politicians; it is the calling of citizens. It is citizenswho turn mean streets into good neighborhoods. It is citizens who turn cold cities into realcommunities. It is one of the great goals of my Administration to invigorate the spirit of involvement andcitizenship. We will encourage faith-based and community programs without changing theirmission. We will help all in their work to change hearts while keeping a commitment topluralism. I approach this goal with some basic principles: Government has important responsibilities forpublic health or public order and civil rights. Yet government -- And government will never bereplaced by charities and community groups. Yet when we see social needs in America, myAdministration will look first to faith-based programs and community groups, which haveproven their power to save and change lives. We will not fund the religious activities of anygroup, but when people of faith provide social services, we will not discriminate against them. As long as there are secular alternatives, faith-based charities should be able to compete forfunding on an equal basis, and in a manner that does not cause them to sacrifice theirmission. And we will make sure that help goes to large organizations and to small ones aswell. We value large organizations with generations of experience. We also valueneighborhood healers, who have only the scars and testimony of their own experience. Tomorrow I will begin turning these principles into a legislative agenda. I will send toCongress a series of ideas and proposals. Today, I want to raise the priority and profile ofthese issues within my own Administration. I want to ensure that faith-based and communitygroups will always have a place at the table in our deliberations.In a few moments, I will sign two executive orders. The first executive order will create a newoffice, called the White House Office of Faith-based and Community Initiatives. The head ofthis office will report directly to me and be charged with important responsibilities. He willoversee our initiatives on this issue. He will make sure our government, where it works withprivate groups, is fair and supportive. And he will highlight groups as national models soothers can learn from them. The second executive order will clear away the bureaucratic barriers in several importantagencies that make private groups hesitate to work with government. It will establish centersin five agencies -- Justice, HUD, HHS, Labor and Education -- to ensure greater cooperationbetween the government and the independent sector. These centers will report back onregulatory barriers to working with non-profit groups, and make recommendations on howthose barriers can be removed. I have put this broad effort into the hands of two exceptional people -- first, Steve Goldsmith,known as one of the most innovative mayors in America, who pioneered ways to promotecommunity efforts. He will continue to advise me on these issues. And I have asked Steve toserve on the board of the Corporation for National Service. This organization has done some good work in mobilizing volunteers of all ages. I've askedSteve to report to me on how we can make the corporation do better, and to get help whereit's most needed. And secondly, Professor John Dilulio will head the new office I am announcing today. He is oneof the most influential social entrepreneurs in America. I can't tell you how honored I am forhim to leave his post in academia to join us. He is the author of a respected textbook onAmerican government. He has a servant's heart on the issues that we will confront. He'sworked with disadvantaged children. He has been a major force in mobilizing the city of -- ofPhiladelphia to support faith-based and community groups. It's a fantastic team. I'm honored to have them on my team. I look forward to hearing fromthem, as well as I look forward to working with the people in this room and the socialentrepreneurs all across America who have heard the universal call to love a neighbor likethey'd like to be loved themselves; to exist and work hard, not out of the love of money, butout of the love of their fellow human beings.I'm absolutely convinced the great fabric of the nation exists in neighborhoods, amongstunsung heroes who do heroic acts on a daily and hourly basis. It's the fabric of the countrythat makes America unique. It is -- The power of promise that makes the future so promisingis the power of the missions that stand behind me. This is an effort that will be an effort from, now the second week of my Administration to thelast week of my Administration, because I'm confident that this initiative, when fullyimplemented, will help us realize the dream that America, its hopes, its promise, itsgreatness, will extend its reach throughout every single neighborhood, all across the land. And now it is my honor to sign the two executive orders.",bush

"President Bush: Good evening. Before I take your questions, let me speak with theAmerican people about the situation in Iraq. This has been tough weeks in that country. Coalition forces have encountered serious violencein some areas of Iraq. Our military commanders report that this violence is being instigated bythree groups: Some remnants of Saddam Hussein's regime, along with Islamic militants haveattacked coalition forces in the city of Fallujah. Terrorists from other countries have infiltratedIraq to incite and organize attacks. In the south of Iraq, coalition forces face riots and attacksthat are being incited by a radical cleric named al-Sadr. He has assembled some of hissupporters into an illegal militia, and publicly supported the terrorist groups, Hamas andHezbollah. Al-Sadr's methods of violence and intimidation are widely repudiated by other IraqiShia. He's been indicted by Iraqi authorities for the murder of a prominent Shia cleric.Although these instigations of violence come from different factions, they share commongoals. They want to run us out of Iraq and destroy the democratic hopes of the Iraqi people.The violence we have seen is a power grab by these extreme and ruthless elements. It's not a civil war; it's not a popular uprising. Most of Iraq is relatively stable. Most Iraqis, byfar, reject violence and oppose dictatorship. In forums where Iraqis have met to discuss theirpolitical future, and in all the proceedings of the Iraqi Governing Council, Iraqis haveexpressed clear commitments. They want strong protections for individual rights; they wanttheir independence; and they want their freedom. America's commitment to freedom in Iraq is consistent with our ideals, and required by ourinterests. Iraq will either be a peaceful, democratic country, or it will again be a source ofviolence, a haven for terror, and a threat to America and to the world. By helping to secure afree Iraq, Americans serving in that country are protecting their fellow citizens. Our nation isgrateful to them all, and to their families that face hardship and long separation. This weekend, at a Fort Hood hospital, I presented a Purple Heart to some of our wounded;had the honor of thanking them on behalf of all Americans. Other men and women have paidan even greater cost. Our nation honors the memory of those who have been killed, and wepray that their families will find God's comfort in the midst of their grief. As I have said tothose who have lost loved ones, we will finish the work of the fallen. America's armed forces are performing brilliantly, with all the skill and honor we expect ofthem. We're constantly reviewing their needs. Troop strength, now and in the future, isdetermined by the situation on the ground. If additional forces are needed, I will send them. Ifadditional resources are needed, we will provide them. The people of our country are unitedbehind our men and women in uniform, and this government will do all that is necessary toassure the success of their historic mission.One central commitment of that mission is the transfer of sovereignty back to the Iraqipeople. We have set a deadline of June 30th. It is important that we meet that deadline. As aproud and independent people, Iraqis do not support an indefinite occupation -- and neitherdoes America. We're not an imperial power, as nations such as Japan and Germany can attest.We are a liberating power, as nations in Europe and Asia can attest, as well. America'sobjective in Iraq is limited, and it is firm: We seek an independent, free and secure Iraq. Were the coalition to step back from the June 30th pledge, many Iraqis would question ourintentions and feel their hopes betrayed. And those in Iraq who trade in hatred and conspiracytheories would find a larger audience and gain a stronger hand. We will not step back fromour pledge. On June 30th, Iraqi sovereignty will be placed in Iraqi hands. Sovereignty involves more than a date and a ceremony. It requires Iraqis to assumeresponsibility for their own future. Iraqi authorities are now confronting the security challengeof the last several weeks. In Fallujah, coalition forces have suspended offensive operations,allowing members of the Iraqi Governing Council and local leaders to work on the restorationof central authority in that city. These leaders are communicating with the insurgents toensure an orderly turnover of that city to Iraqi forces, so that the resumption of military actiondoes not become necessary. They're also insisting that those who killed and mutilated fourAmerican contract workers be handed over for trial and punishment. In addition, members ofthe Governing Council are seeking to resolve the situation in the south. Al-Sadr must answerthe charges against him and disband his illegal militia. Our coalition is standing with responsible Iraqi leaders as they establish growing authority intheir country. The transition to sovereignty requires that we demonstrate confidence in Iraqis,and we have that confidence. Many Iraqi leaders are showing great personal courage, andtheir example will bring out the same quality in others. The transition to sovereignty alsorequires an atmosphere of security, and our coalition is working to provide that security. Wewill continue taking the greatest care to prevent harm to innocent civilians; yet we will notpermit the spread of chaos and violence.I have directed our military commanders to make every preparation to use decisive force, ifnecessary, to maintain order and to protect our troops. The nation of Iraq is moving toward self-rule, and Iraqis and Americans will see evidence inthe months to come. On June 30th, when the flag of free Iraq is raised, Iraqi officials willassume full responsibility for the ministries of government. On that day, the transitionaladministrative law, including a bill of rights that is unprecedented in the Arab world, will takefull effect. The United States, and all the nations of our coalition, will establish normal diplomaticrelations with the Iraqi government. An American embassy will open, and an Americanambassador will be posted. According to the schedule already approved by the Governing Council, Iraq will hold electionsfor a national assembly no later than next January. That assembly will draft a new, permanentconstitution which will be presented to the Iraqi people in a national referendum held inOctober of next year. Iraqis will then elect a permanent government by December 15, 2005 --an event that will mark the completion of Iraq's transition from dictatorship to freedom. Other nations and international institutions are stepping up to their responsibilities in buildinga free and secure Iraq. We're working closely with the United Nations envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi,and with Iraqis to determine the exact form of the government that will receive sovereigntyon June 30th. The United Nations election assistance team, headed by Karina Parelli(phonetic), is in Iraq, developing plans for next January's election. NATO is providing supportfor the Polish-led multinational division in Iraq. And 17 of NATO's 26 members arecontributing forces to maintain security. Secretary of State Powell and Secretary of State Rumsfeld, and a number of NATO defenseand foreign ministers are exploring a more formal role for NATO, such as turning the Polish-led division into a NATO operation, and giving NATO specific responsibilities for border control.Iraqi's neighbors also have responsibilities to make their region more stable. So I am sendingDeputy Secretary of State Armitage to the Middle East to discuss with these nations ourcommon interest in a free and independent Iraq, and how they can help achieve this goal. As we've made clear all along, our commitment to the success and security of Iraq will notend on June 30th. On July 1st, and beyond, our reconstruction assistance will continue, andour military commitment will continue. Having helped Iraqis establish a new government,coalition military forces will help Iraqis to protect their government from external aggressionand internal subversion.The success of free government in Iraq is vital for many reasons. A free Iraq is vital because25 million Iraqis have as much right to live in freedom as we do. A free Iraq will stand as anexample to reformers across the Middle East. A free Iraq will show that America is on the sideof Muslims who wish to live in peace, as we have already shown in Kuwait and Kosovo, Bosniaand Afghanistan. A free Iraq will confirm to a watching world that America's word, once given,can be relied upon, even in the toughest times. Above all, the defeat of violence and terror in Iraq is vital to the defeat of violence and terrorelsewhere; and vital, therefore, to the safety of the American people. Now is the time, andIraq is the place, in which the enemies of the civilized world are testing the will of the civilizedworld. We must not waver. The violence we are seeing in Iraq is familiar. The terrorist who takes hostages, or plants aroadside bomb near Baghdad is serving the same ideology of murder that kills innocent peopleon trains in Madrid, and murders children on buses in Jerusalem, and blows up a nightclub inBali, and cuts the throat of a young reporter for being a Jew. We've seen the same ideology of murder in the killing of 241 Marines in Beirut, the first attackon the World Trade Center, in the destruction of two embassies in Africa, in the attack on theUSS Cole, and in the merciless horror inflicted upon thousands of innocent men and womenand children on September the 11th, 2001.None of these acts is the work of a religion; all are the work of a fanatical, political ideology.The servants of this ideology seek tyranny in the Middle East and beyond. They seek tooppress and persecute women. They seek the death of Jews and Christians, and every Muslimwho desires peace over theocratic terror. They seek to intimidate America into panic andretreat, and to set free nations against each other. And they seek weapons of massdestruction, to blackmail and murder on a massive scale. Over the last several decades, we've seen that any concession or retreat on our part will onlyembolden this enemy and invite more bloodshed. And the enemy has seen, over the last 31months, that we will no longer live in denial or seek to appease them. For the first time, thecivilized world has provided a concerted response to the ideology of terror -- a series ofpowerful, effective blows. The terrorists have lost the shelter of the Taliban and the training camps in Afghanistan.They've lost safe havens in Pakistan. They lost an ally in Baghdad. And Libya has turned itsback on terror. They've lost many leaders in an unrelenting international manhunt. Andperhaps most frightening to these men and their movement, the terrorists are seeing theadvance of freedom and reform in the greater Middle East. A desperate enemy is also a dangerous enemy, and our work may become more difficultbefore it is finished. No one can predict all the hazards that lie ahead, or the costs they willbring. Yet, in this conflict, there is no safe alternative to resolute action. The consequences offailure in Iraq would be unthinkable. Every friend of America and Iraq would be betrayed toprison and murder as a new tyranny arose. Every enemy of America and the world wouldcelebrate, proclaiming our weakness and decadence, and using that victory to recruit a newgeneration of killers. We will succeed in Iraq. We're carrying out a decision that has already been made and will notchange: Iraq will be a free, independent country, and America and the Middle East will besafer because of it. Our coalition has the means and the will to prevail. We serve the cause ofliberty, and that is, always and everywhere, a cause worth serving.Now, I'll be glad to take your questions. I will start with you.Question: Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, April is turning into the deadliest month inIraq since the fall of Baghdad, and some people are comparing Iraq to Vietnam and talkingabout a quagmire. Polls show that support for your policy is declining and that fewer than halfAmericans now support it. What does that say to you and how do you answer the Vietnamcomparison? President Bush: I think the analogy is false. I also happen to think that analogy sends thewrong message to our troops, and sends the wrong message to the enemy. Look, this is hardwork. It's hard to advance freedom in a country that has been strangled by tyranny. And, yet,we must stay the course, because the end result is in our nation's interest. A secure and free Iraq is an historic opportunity to change the world and make America moresecure. A free Iraq in the midst of the Middle East will have incredible change. It's hard --freedom is not easy to achieve. We had a little trouble in our country achieving freedom. Andwe've been there a year, Terry. I know it seems like a long time, it seems like a long time tothe loved ones whose troops have been overseas. But when you think about where thecountry has come from, it's a relatively short period of time. And we're making progress. There's no question it's been a tough, tough series of weeks for the American people. It'sbeen really tough for the families. I understand that. It's been tough on this administration.But we're doing the right thing. And as to whether or not I make decisions based upon polls, I don't. I just don't makedecisions that way. I fully understand the consequences of what we're doing. We're changingthe world. And the world will be better off and America will be more secure as a result of theactions we're taking.Question: Thank you, Mr. President. What's your best prediction on how long U.S. troops willhave to be in Iraq? And it sounds like you will have to add some troops; is that a fairassessment? President Bush: Well, I -- first of all, that's up to General Abizaid, and he's clearly indicatingthat he may want more troops. It's coming up through the chain of command. If that's whathe wants, that's what he gets. Generally, we've had about 115,000 troops in Iraq. There's135,000 now, as a result of the changeover from one division to the next. If he wants to keeptroops there to help, I'm more than willing to say, ""Yes, General Abizaid."" I talk to General Abizaid quite frequently. I'm constantly asking him, does he have what heneeds -- whether it be in troop strength, or in equipment. He and General Sanchez talk all thetime. And if he makes the recommendation, he'll get it. In terms of how long we'll be there: as long as necessary, and not one day more. The Iraqipeople need us there to help with security. They need us there to fight off these violent fewwho are doing everything they can to resist the advance of freedom. And I mentioned whothey are. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, our commanders on the ground have got theauthority necessary to deal with violence, and will -- and will in firm fashion. And that's what,by far, the vast majority of the Iraqis want -- they want security so they can advance towarda free society. Once we transfer sovereignty, we'll enter into a security agreement with the government towhich we pass sovereignty, the entity to which we pass sovereignty. And we'll need to bethere for a while. We'll also need to continue training the Iraqi troops. I was disappointed inthe performance of some of the troops. Some of the units performed brilliantly; some of themdidn't, and we need to find out why.If they're lacking equipment, we'll get them equipment. If there needs to be more intensetraining, we'll get more intense training. But, eventually, Iraq's security is going to be handledby the Iraqi people, themselves. Let's see here -- Terry. Question: Mr. President, before the war, you and members of your administration madeseveral claims about Iraq that U.S. troops would be greeted as liberators with sweets andflowers, that Iraqi oil revenue would pay for most of the reconstruction; and that Iraq not onlyhad weapons of mass destruction, but as Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld said, we know wherethey are. How do you explain to Americans how you got that so wrong? And how do youanswer your opponents, who say that you took this nation to war on the basis of what haveturned out to be a series a false premises? President Bush: Well, let me step back and review my thinking prior to going into Iraq. First,the lesson of September the 11th is, when this nation sees a threat, a gathering threat, we'vegot to deal with it. We can no longer hope that oceans protect us from harm. Every threat wemust take seriously. Saddam Hussein was a threat. He was a threat because he had used weapons of massdestruction on his own people. He was a threat because he coddled terrorists. He was a threatbecause he funded suiciders. He was a threat to the region. He was a threat to the UnitedStates. That's the assessment that I made from the intelligence, the assessment thatCongress made from the intelligence; that's the exact same assessment that the UnitedNations Security Council made with the intelligence. I went to the U.N., as you might recall, and said, either you take care of him, or we will. Anytime an American President says, if you don't, we will, we better be prepared to. And I wasprepared to. I thought it was important for the United Nations Security Council that when itsays something, it means something, for the sake of security in the world.See, the war on terror had changed the calculations. We needed to work with people. Peopleneeded to come together to work. And, therefore, empty words would embolden the actions ofthose who are willing to kill indiscriminately. The United Nations passed a Security Council resolution unanimously that said, disarm or faceserious consequences. And he refused to disarm. I thought it was very interesting that Charlie Duelfer, who just came back -- he's the head ofthe Iraqi Survey Group -- reported some interesting findings from his recent tour there. Andone of the things was, he was amazed at how deceptive the Iraqis had been toward UNMOVICand UNSCOM; deceptive in hiding things. We knew they were hiding things -- a country thathides something is a country that is afraid of getting caught. And that was part of ourcalculation. Charlie confirmed that. He also confirmed that Saddam had a -- the ability toproduce biological and chemical weapons. In other words, he was a danger. He had long-range missiles that were undeclared to the United Nations; he was a danger. And so we dealtwith him. What else -- part of the question -- oh, oil revenues. Well, the oil revenues are -- they'rebigger than we thought they would be at this point in time. I mean, one year after theliberation of Iraq, the revenues of the oil stream is pretty darn significant. One of the things Iwas concerned about prior to going into Iraq was that the oil fields would be destroyed. Butthey weren't, they're now up and running. And that money is -- it will benefit the Iraqi people.It's their oil, and they'll use it to reconstruct the country. Finally, the attitude of the Iraqis toward the American people -- it's an interesting question.They're really pleased we got rid of Saddam Hussein. And you can understand why. This is aguy who was a torturer, a killer, a maimer; there's mass graves. I mean, he was a horribleindividual that really shocked the country in many ways, shocked it into a kind of -- a fear ofmaking decisions toward liberty. That's what we've seen recently. Some citizens are fearful ofstepping up.And they were happy -- they're not happy they're occupied. I wouldn't be happy if I wereoccupied either. They do want us there to help with security, and that's why this transfer ofsovereignty is an important signal to send, and it's why it's also important for them to hear wewill stand with them until they become a free country. Elisabeth. Question: Thank you, Mr. President. To move to the 9/11 Commission. You, yourself, haveacknowledged that Osama bin Laden was not a central focus of the administration in themonths before September 11th. ""I was not on point,"" you told the journalist, Bob Woodward,""I didn't feel that sense of urgency."" Two-and-a-half years later, do you feel any sense ofpersonal responsibility for September 11th? President Bush: Let me put that quote to Woodward in context. He had asked me if I was --something about killing bin Laden. That's what the question was. And I said, compared to howI felt at the time, after the attack, I didn't have that -- I also went on to say, my blood wasn'tboiling, I think is what the quote said. I didn't see -- I mean, I didn't have that great sense ofoutrage that I felt on September the 11th. I was -- on that day I was angry and sad: angrythat al Qaeda had -- well, at the time, thought al Qaeda, found out shortly thereafter it was alQaeda -- had unleashed this attack; sad for those who lost their life. Your question -- do I feel -- Question: Do you feel a sense of personal responsibility for September 11th? President Bush: I feel incredibly grieved when I meet with family members, and I do quitefrequently. I grieve for the incredible loss of life that they feel, the emptiness they feel. Thereare some things I wish we'd have done when I look back. I mean, hindsight is easy. It's easyfor a President to stand up and say, now that I know what happened, it would have been niceif there were certain things in place; for example, a homeland security department. And why I-- I say that because it's -- that provides the ability for our agencies to coordinate better andto work together better than it was before.I think the hearings will show that the Patriot Act is an important change in the law that willallow the FBI and the CIA to better share information together. We were kind of stove-piped, Iguess is a way to describe it. There was kind of -- departments that at times didn'tcommunicate, because of law, in the FBI's case. And the other thing I look back on and realize is that we weren't on a war footing. The countrywas not on a war footing, and yet the enemy was at war with us. And it's -- it didn't take melong to put us on a war footing. And we've been on war ever since. The lessons of 9/11 that I-- one lesson was, we must deal with gathering threats. And that's part of the reason I dealtwith Iraq the way I did. The other lesson is, is that this country must go on the offense and stay on the offense. Inorder to secure the country, we must do everything in our power to find these killers andbring them to justice, before they hurt us again. I'm afraid they want to hurt us again. They'restill there. They can be right one time; we've got to be right a hundred percent of the time in order toprotect the country. It's a mighty task. But our government has changed since the 9/11attacks. We're better equipped to respond; we're better at sharing intelligence. But we've stillgot a lot of work to do.Dave. Question: Mr. President, I'd like to follow up on a couple of these questions that have beenasked. One of the biggest criticisms of you is that whether it's WMD in Iraq, postwar planningin Iraq, or even the question of whether this administration did enough to ward off 9/11, younever admit a mistake. Is that a fair criticism? And do you believe there were any errors injudgment that you made related to any of those topics I brought up?President Bush: Well, I think, as I mentioned, it's -- the country wasn't on war footing, andyet we're at war. And that's just a reality, Dave. I mean, that's -- that was the situation thatexisted prior to 9/11, because the truth of the matter is, most in the country never felt thatwe'd be vulnerable to an attack such as the one that Osama bin Laden unleashed on us. Weknew he had designs on us, we knew he hated us. But there was a -- nobody in ourgovernment, at least, and I don't think the prior government, could envision flying airplanesinto buildings on such a massive scale. The people know where I stand. I mean, in terms of Iraq, I was very clear about what Ibelieved. And, of course, I want to know why we haven't found a weapon yet. But I still knowSaddam Hussein was a threat, and the world is better off without Saddam Hussein. I don'tthink anybody can -- maybe people can argue that. I know the Iraqi people don't believe that,that they're better off with Saddam Hussein -- would be better off with Saddam Hussein inpower. I also know that there's an historic opportunity here to change the world. And it's veryimportant for the loved ones of our troops to understand that the mission is an important,vital mission for the security of America and for the ability to change the world for the better. Let's see -- Ed. Question: Mr. President, good evening. You've talked on the -- I'd like to ask you about theAugust 6th PDB. President Bush: Sure. Question: You mentioned it at Fort Hood on Sunday. You said -- you pointed out that it didnot warn of a hijacking of airplanes to crash into buildings, but that it warned of hijacking to,obviously, take hostages and to secure the release of extremists being held by the U.S. Didthat trigger some specific actions on your part and the administration, since it dealt withpotentially hundreds of lives and a blackmail attempt on the United States government?President Bush: Ed, I asked for the briefing. And the reason I did is because there had beena lot of threat intelligence from overseas. And so -- part of it had to do with Genoa, the G8conference that I was going to attend. And I asked, at that point in time, let's make sure weare paying attention here at home, as well. And that's what triggered the report. The report, itself, I've characterized as mainly history, and I think when you look at it you'llsee that it was talking about '97 and '98 and '99. It was also an indication, as you mentioned,that bin Laden might want to hijack an airplane, but as you said, not to fly into a building, butperhaps to release a person in jail. In other words, serve it as a blackmail. And of course, that concerns me. All those reports concern me. As a matter of fact, I wasdealing with terrorism a lot as the President when George Tenet came in to brief me. I mean,that's where I got my information. I changed the way that -- the relationship between thePresident and the CIA Director. And I wanted Tenet in the Oval Office all the time. And we hadbriefings about terrorist threats. This was a summary. Now, in what's called the PDB, there was a warning about bin Laden's desires on America, but,frankly, I didn't think that was anything new. Major newspapers had talked about bin Laden'sdesires on hurting America. What was interesting in there was that there was a report that theFBI was conducting field investigations. And I -- that was good news that they were doingtheir job. The way my administration worked, Ed, is that I met with Tenet all the time, obviously metwith my principals a lot. We talked about threats that had emerged. We had acounterterrorism group meeting on a regular basis to analyze the threats that came in. Hadthere been a threat that required action by anybody in the government, I would have dealtwith it. In other words, had they come up and said, this is where we see somethinghappening, you can rest assured that the people of this government would have responded,and responded in a forceful way.I mean, one of the things about Elisabeth's question was, I step back and I've asked myself alot, is there anything we could have done to stop the attacks. Of course, I've asked thatquestion -- as have many people of my government. Nobody wants this to happen to America.And the answer is that had I had any inkling whatsoever that the people were going to flyairplanes into buildings, we would have moved heaven and earth to save the country -- justlike we're working hard to prevent a further attack. Let's see -- Jim. Question: Thank you, Mr. President. You mentioned the PDB and the assurance you got thatthe FBI was working on terrorism investigations here. The number they had used was 70. Butwe learned today in the September 11th hearings that the Acting Director of the FBI at thetime says -- now says the FBI tells him that number was wrong, that he doesn't even knowhow it got into your PDB. And two of the commissioners strongly suggested the number wasexaggerated. Have you learned anything else about that report since that time? And do younow believe you were falsely comforted by the FBI? President Bush: No, I heard about that today, obviously, and my response to that was Iexpect to get valid information. As the ultimate decision-maker for this country, I expectinformation that comes to my desk to be real and valid. And I presume the 9/11 Commissionwill find out -- will follow up on his suggestions and his recollection and garner the truth. That is an important part of the 9/11 Commission's job, is to analyze what went on and whatcould have, perhaps, been done differently so that we can better secure America for thefuture. But, of course, I expect to get valid information. I can't make good decisions unless Iget valid information. Question: Has the FBI come back to you, sir? President Bush: No, I haven't talked to anybody today. But I will, though. We'll find out. John.Question: Thank you, Mr. President. Two weeks ago, a former counterterrorism official at theNSC, Richard Clarke, offered an unequivocal apology to the American people for failing themprior to 9/11. Do you believe the American people deserve a similar apology from you, andwould you be prepared to give them one? President Bush: Look, I can understand why people in my administration anguished over thefact that people lost their life. I feel the same way. I mean, I'm sick when I think about thedeath that took place on that day. And as I mentioned, I've met with a lot of family membersand I do the best I do to console them about the loss of their loved one. As I mentioned, Ioftentimes think about what I could have done differently. I can assure the American peoplethat had we had any inkling that this was going to happen, we would have done everything inour power to stop the attack. Here's what I feel about that. The person responsible for the attacks was Osama bin Laden.That's who's responsible for killing Americans. And that's why we will stay on the offense untilwe bring people to justice. John. Question: Mr. President, thank you. You mentioned 17 of the 26 NATO members providingsome help on the ground in Iraq. But if you look at the numbers -- 135,000 U.S. troops,10,000 or 12,000 British troops, then the next largest, perhaps even the second largestcontingent of guns on the ground are private contractors -- literally, hired guns. Your critics, including your Democratic opponent, say that's proof to them your coalition is windowdressing. How would you answer those critics? And can you assure the American people thatpost-sovereignty, when the handover takes place, that there will be more burden sharing byallies, in terms of security forces?President Bush: John, my response is, I don't think people ought to demean thecontributions of our friends into Iraq. People are sacrificing their lives in Iraq, from differentcountries. We ought to honor that, and we ought to welcome that. I'm proud of the coalitionthat is there. This is a -- these are people that have -- the gut leaders have made the decisionto put people in harm's way for the good of the world. And we appreciate that sacrifice inAmerica. We appreciate that commitment. I think -- one of the things you're seeing is more involvement by the United Nations, in termsof the political process. That's helpful. I'd like to get another U.N. Security Council resolutionout that will help other nations to decide to participate. One of the things I've found, John, is that in calling around -- particularly during this week, Ispoke to Prime Minister Berlusconi and President Kwasniewski -- there is a resolve by theseleaders that is a heartening resolve. Tony Blair is the same way -- he understands, like Iunderstand, that we cannot yield at this point in time; that we must remain steadfast andstrong; that it's the intentions of the enemy to shake our will. That's what they want to do --they want us to leave. And we're not going to leave. We're going to do the job. And a freeIraq is going to be a major blow for terrorism. It will change the world. A free Iraq in themidst of the Middle East is vital to future peace and security. Maybe I can best put it this way, why I feel so strongly about this historic moment. I washaving dinner with Prime Minister Koizumi, and we were talking about North Korea, about howwe can work together to deal with the threat. The North Korea leader is a threat. And here aretwo friends now discussing what strategy to employ to prevent him from further developingand deploying a nuclear weapon. And it dawned on me that had we blown the peace in WorldWar II, that perhaps this conversation would not have been taking place. It also dawned onme then that when we get it right in Iraq, at some point in time an American President will besitting down with a duly-elected Iraqi leader talking about how to bring security to what hasbeen a troubled part of the world.The legacy that our troops are going to leave behind is a legacy of lasting importance, as faras I'm concerned. It's a legacy that really is based upon our deep belief that people want tobe free and that free societies are peaceful societies. Some of the debate really center around the fact that people don't believe Iraq can be free;that if you're Muslim, or perhaps brown-skinned, you can't be self-governing and free. Istrongly disagree with that. I reject that, because I believe that freedom is the deepest needof every human soul, and, if given a chance, the Iraqi people will be not only self-governing,but a stable and free society. Let's see here, hold on. Michael. You're next. Question: Mr. President, why are you and the Vice President insisting on appearing togetherbefore the 9/11 Commission? And, Mr. President, who will you be handing the Iraqigovernment over to on June 30th? President Bush: We will find that out soon. That's what Mr. Brahimi is doing; he's figuringout the nature of the entity we'll be handing sovereignty over. And, secondly, because the9/11 Commission wants to ask us questions, that's why we're meeting. And I look forward tomeeting with them and answering their questions. Question: I was asking why you're appearing together, rather than separately, which wastheir request. President Bush: Because it's a good chance for both of us to answer questions that the 9/11Commission is looking forward to asking us, and I'm looking forward to answering them. Let's see -- Question: Mr. President -- President Bush: Hold on for a minute. Oh, Jim.Question: Thank you, Mr. President. President Bush: I've got some ""must calls,"" I'm sorry. Question: You have been accused of letting the 9/11 threat mature too far, but not lettingthe Iraq threat mature far enough. First, could you respond to that general criticism? And,secondly, in the wake of these two conflicts, what is the appropriate threat level to justifyaction in perhaps other situations going forward? President Bush: I guess there have been some that said, well, we should have takenpreemptive action in Afghanistan, and then turned around and said we shouldn't have takenpreemptive action in Iraq. And my answer to that question is, is that, again I repeat what Isaid earlier -- prior to 9/11 the country really wasn't on a war footing. And the, frankly, moodof the world would have been astounded had the United States acted unilaterally in trying todeal with al Qaeda in that part of the world. It would have been awfully hard to do, as well, by the way -- we would have had to -- wehadn't got our relationship right with Pakistan yet. The Caucus area would have been verydifficult from which to base. It just seemed an impractical strategy at the time, and frankly, Ididn't contemplate it. I did contemplate a larger strategy as to how to deal with al Qaeda. We were shooting Cruisemissiles, and with little effect. And I said, if we're going to go after al Qaeda, let's have acomprehensive strategy as to how to deal with it, with that entity. After 9/11, the world changed for me, and I think changed for the country. It changed for mebecause, like many, we assumed oceans would protect us from harm, and that's not the case,it's not the reality of the 21st century. Oceans don't protect us. They don't protect us fromkillers. We're an open country, and we're a country that values our openness. And we're ahard country to defend. And, therefore, when we see threats overseas, we've got to takethem -- look at them in a new light. And I've given my explanation of Iraq.Your further question was, how do you justify any other preemptive action. The Americanpeople need to know my last choice is the use of military power. It is something that -- it is adecision that -- it's a tough decision to make for any President, because I fully understand theconsequences of the decision. And, therefore, we'll use all other means necessary, when wesee a threat, to deal with a threat that may materialize, but we'll never take the military offthe table. We've had some success, Bill, as a result of the decision I took. Take Libya, for example.Libya was a nation that had -- we viewed as a terrorist -- a nation that sponsored terror, anation that was dangerous because of weapons. And Colonel Gadhafi made the decision, andrightly so, to disclose and disarm, for the good of the world. By the way, they found, I think,50 tons of mustard gas, I believe it was, in a turkey farm, only because he was willing todisclose where the mustard gas was. But that made the world safer. The A.Q. Khan bust, the network that we uncovered, thanks tothe hard work of our intelligence-gathering agencies and the cooperation of the British, wasanother victory in the war against terror. This was a shadowy network of folks that werewilling to sell state secrets to the highest bidder. And that, therefore, made the world moreunstable and more dangerous. You've often heard me talk about my worry about weapons ofmass destruction ending up in the hands of the wrong people. Well, you can understand why Ifeel that way, having seen the works of A.Q. Khan. It's a dangerous -- it was a dangerousnetwork that we unraveled. And the world is better for it. And so what I'm telling you is, is that sometimes we use military as a last resort, but othertimes we use our influence, diplomatic pressure, and our alliances, to unravel, uncover,expose people who want to do harm against the civilized world. We're at war. Iraq is a part ofthe war on terror. It is not the war on terror; it is a theater in the war on terror. And it'sessential we win this battle in the war on terror. By winning this battle, it will make othervictories more certain in the war against the terrorists. Let's see here. Judy.Question: Thank you, Mr. President. Sir, you've made it very clear tonight that you'recommitted to continuing the mission in Iraq. Yet, as Terry pointed out, increasing numbers ofAmericans have qualms about it. And this is an election year. Will it have been worth it, evenif you lose your job because of it? President Bush: I don't plan on losing my job. I plan on telling the American people that I'vegot a plan to win the war on terror. And I believe they'll stay with me. They understand thestakes. Look, nobody likes to see dead people on their television screens -- I don't. It's atough time for the American people to see that. It's gut-wrenching. One of my hardest partsof my job is to console the family members who have lost their life. It is a -- it is -- it's achance to hug and weep and to console and to remind the loved ones that the sacrifice oftheir loved one was done in the name of security for America and freedom for the world. And one of the things that's very important, Judy, as far as I'm concerned, is to never allowour youngsters to die in vain. And I made that pledge to their parents. Withdrawing from thebattlefield of Iraq would be just that. And it's not going to happen under my watch. The American people may decide to change -- that's democracy. I don't think so, I don't thinkso. And I look forward to making my case. I'm looking forward to the campaign. Now is thetime to talk about winning this war on terror. Now is the time to make sure that the Americanpeople understand the stakes and the historic significance of what we're doing. And no matterwhere they may stand on this war, the thing I appreciate most about our country is the strongsupport given to the men and women in uniform. And it's vital support. It's important forthose soldiers to know America stands with them. And we weep when they die, and we'reproud of the victories they achieve. One of the things I'm also proud of is what I hear from our soldiers. As I mentioned, I pinnedthe Purple Heart on some of the troops at the hospital there at Fort Hood, Texas. A guy looksat me and says, I can't wait to get back to my unit and fulfill the mission, Mr. President. Thespirit is incredible. Our soldiers who have volunteered to go there understand the stakes. AndI'm incredibly proud of them.John. Question: Thank you, Mr. President. In the last campaign, you were asked a question aboutthe biggest mistake you'd made in your life, and you used to like to joke that it was tradingSammy Sosa. You've looked back before 9/11 for what mistakes might have been made. After9/11, what would your biggest mistake be, would you say, and what lessons have you learnedfrom it? President Bush: I wish you would have given me this written question ahead of time, so Icould plan for it. John, I'm sure historians will look back and say, gosh, he could have done itbetter this way, or that way. You know, I just -- I'm sure something will pop into my headhere in the midst of this press conference, with all the pressure of trying to come up with ananswer, but it hadn't yet. I would have gone into Afghanistan the way we went into Afghanistan. Even knowing what Iknow today about the stockpiles of weapons, I still would have called upon the world to dealwith Saddam Hussein. See, I happen to believe that we'll find out the truth on the weapons.That's why we've sent up the independent commission. I look forward to hearing the truth,exactly where they are. They could still be there. They could be hidden, like the 50 tons ofmustard gas in a turkey farm. One of the things that Charlie Duelfer talked about was that he was surprised at the level ofintimidation he found amongst people who should know about weapons, and their fear oftalking about them because they don't want to be killed. There's a terror still in the soul ofsome of the people in Iraq; they're worried about getting killed, and, therefore, they're notgoing to talk. But it will all settle out, John. We'll find out the truth about the weapons at some point intime. However, the fact that he had the capacity to make them bothers me today, just like itwould have bothered me then.He's a dangerous man. He's a man who actually -- not only had weapons of mass destruction-- the reason I can say that with certainty is because he used them. And I have no doubt inmy mind that he would like to have inflicted harm, or paid people to inflict harm, or trainedpeople to inflict harm on America, because he hated us. I hope I -- I don't want to sound like I've made no mistakes. I'm confident I have. I justhaven't -- you just put me under the spot here, and maybe I'm not as quick on my feet as Ishould be in coming up with one. Yes, Ann. Question: Looking forward about keeping the United States safe -- a group representingabout several thousand FBI agents today wrote to your administration begging you not to splitup the law enforcement and the counterterrorism, because they say it ties their hands, it'sblinders -- yet, you mentioned yesterday that you think perhaps the time has come for somereal intelligence reforms. That can't happen without real leadership from the White House. Willyou, and how will you? President Bush: Well, you're talking about one aspect of possible -- I think you're referringto what they call the MI-5. And I heard a summary of that from Director Mueller, who feelsstrongly that we -- and he'll testify to that effect, I guess, tomorrow, I shouldn't be prejudginghis testimony. But what -- my point was is that I'm open for suggestions. I look forward toseeing what the 9/11 Commission comes up with; I look forward to seeing what theSilberman/Robb Commission comes up with. I'm confident Congress will have somesuggestions. What I'm saying is, let the discussions begin. And I won't prejudge theconclusion. As the President, I will encourage and foster these kinds of discussions, becauseone of the jobs of the President is to leave behind a legacy that will enable other Presidents tobetter deal with the threat that we face.We are in a long war. The war on terror is not going to end immediately. This is a war againstpeople who have no guilt in killing innocent people. That's what they're willing to do. They killon a moment's notice because they're trying to shake our will, they're trying to create fear,they're trying to affect people's behaviors. And we're simply not going to let them do that. And my fear, of course, is that this will go on for a while -- and, therefore, it's incumbent uponus to learn from lessons or mistakes, and leave behind a better foundation for Presidents todeal with the threats we face. This is the war that other Presidents will be facing as we headinto the 21st century. One of the interesting things people ask me, now that we're asking questions, is, can you everwin the war on terror? Of course, you can. That's why it's important for us to spread freedomthroughout the Middle East. Free societies are hopeful societies. A hopeful society is one morelikely to be able to deal with the frustrations of those who are willing to commit suicide inorder to represent a false ideology. A free society is a society in which somebody is morelikely to be able to make a living. A free society is a society in which someone is more likely tobe able to raise their child in a comfortable environment, and see to it that that child gets aneducation. That's why I'm pressing the Greater Middle East Reform Initiative, to work to spread freedom.And we will continue on that. So long as I'm the President, I will press for freedom. I believeso strongly in the power of freedom. You know why I do? Because I've seen freedom work right here in our own country. I alsohave this belief, strong belief, that freedom is not this country's gift to the world; freedom isthe Almighty's gift to every man and woman in this world. And as the greatest power on theface of the Earth, we have an obligation to help the spread of freedom. We have an obligationto help feed the hungry. I think the American people find it interesting that we're providingfood for the North Korea people who starve. We have an obligation to lead the fight on AIDS,on Africa. And we have an obligation to work toward a more free world. That's our obligation.That is what we have been called to do, as far as I'm concerned.And my job as the President is to lead this nation into making the world a better place. Andthat's exactly what we're doing. Weeks such as we've had in Iraq make some doubt whetheror not we're making progress. I understand that. It was a tough, tough period. But we aremaking progress. And my message today to those in Iraq is: We'll stay the course; we'll complete the job. Mymessage to our troops is: We will stay the course and complete the job and you'll have whatyou need. And my message to the loved ones who are worried about their sons, daughters,husbands, wives, is: You're loved one is performing a noble service for the cause of freedomand peace. Let's see, last question here. Hold on for a second. Those who yell will not be asked. I'll tellyou a guy who I've never heard from -- Don. Question: I appreciate it. President Bush: It's a well-received --Question: Following on both Judy's and John's questions, and it comes out of what you justsaid in some ways, with public support for your policies in Iraq falling off the way they have --quite significantly over the past couple of months -- I guess I'd like to know if you feel in anyway that you've failed as a communicator on this topic? Because -- President Bush: Gosh, I don't know. I mean -- Question: Well, you deliver a lot of speeches and a lot of them contain similar phrases, andthey vary very little from one to the next. And they often include a pretty upbeat assessmentof how things are going -- with the exception of tonight's pretty somber assessment, thisevening. President Bush: It's a pretty somber assessment today, Don, yes.Question: I guess I just wonder if you feel that you have failed in any way? You don't havemany of these press conferences, where you engage in this kind of exchange. Have you failedin any way to really make the case to the American public? President Bush: I guess if you put it into a political context, that's the kind of thing thevoters will decide next November. That's what elections are about. They'll take a look at meand my opponent and say, let's see, which one of them can better win the war on terror? Whobest can see to it that Iraq emerges as a free society? Don, if I tried to fine-tune my messages based upon polls, I think I'd be pretty ineffective. Iknow I would be disappointed in myself. I hope today you've got a sense of my convictionabout what we're doing. If you don't, maybe I need to learn to communicate better. I feel strongly about what we're doing. I feel strongly that the course this administration hastaken will make America more secure and the world more free, and, therefore, the world morepeaceful. It's a conviction that's deep in my soul. And I will say it as best as I possibly can tothe American people. I look forward to the debate and the campaign. I look forward to helping -- for the Americanpeople to hear, what is a proper use of American power; do we have an obligation to lead, orshould we shirk responsibility. That's how I view this debate. And I look forward to making it,Don. I'll do it the best I possibly can. I'll give it the best shot. I'll speak as plainly as I can. One thing is for certain, though, about me -- and the world has learned this -- when I saysomething, I mean it. And the credibility of the United States is incredibly important forkeeping world peace and freedom. Thank you all very much.",bush
"Thank you all very much. I'm honored to join with President Clinton, President Bush, SenatorDole and other distinguished guests on this day of remembrance and celebration. And,General Kelley, here in the company of the generation that won the war, I proudly accept theWorld War II Memorial on behalf of the people of the United States of America.Raising up this Memorial took skill and vision and patience. Now the work is done, and it is afitting tribute, open and expansive, like America; grand and enduring, like the achievementswe honor. The years of World War II were a hard, heroic and gallant time in the life of ourcountry. When it mattered most, an entire generation of Americans showed the finest qualitiesof our nation and of humanity. On this day, in their honor, we will raise the American flag overa monument that will stand as long as America itself.In the history books, the Second World War can appear as a series of crises and conflicts,following an inevitable course -- from Pearl Harbor to the Coast of Normandy to the deck ofthe Missouri. Yet, on the day the war began, and on many hard days that followed, theoutcome was far from certain.There was a time, in the years before the war, when many earnest and educated peoplebelieved that democracy was finished. Men who considered themselves learned and civilizedcame to believe that free institutions must give way to the severe doctrines and sterndiscipline of a regimented society. Ideas first whispered in the secret councils of a remoteempire, or shouted in the beer halls of Munich, became mass movements. And thosemovements became armies. And those armies moved mercilessly forward -- until the worldsaw Hitler strutting in Paris, and U.S. Navy ships burning in their own port. Across the world,from a hiding place in Holland to prison camps of Luzon, the captives awaited their liberators.Those liberators would come, but the enterprise would require the commitment and effort ofour entire nation. As World War II began, after a decade of economic depression, the UnitedStates was not a rich country. Far from being a great power, we had only the 17th largestarmy in the world. To fight and win on two fronts, Americans had to work and save and rationand sacrifice as never before. War production plants operated shifts around the clock. Acrossthe country, families planted victory gardens -- 20 million of them, producing 40 percent ofthe nation's vegetables in backyards and on rooftops. Two out of every three citizens putmoney into war bonds. As Colonel Oveta Culp Hobby said, ""This was a people's war, andeveryone was in it.""As life changed in America, so did the way that Americans saw our own country and its placein the world. The bombs at Pearl Harbor destroyed the very idea that America could live inisolation from the plots of aggressive powers. The scenes of the concentration camps, theheaps of bodies and ghostly survivors, confirmed forever America's calling to oppose theideologies of death.As we defended our ideals, we began to see that America is stronger when those ideals arefully implemented. America gained strength because women labored for victory and factoryjobs, cared for the wounded and wore the uniform, themselves. America gained strengthbecause African Americans and Japanese Americans and others fought for their country, whichwasn't always fair to them. In time, these contributions became expectations of equality, andthe advances for justice in post-war America made us a better country.With all our flaws, Americans at that time had never been more united. And together webegan and completed the largest single task in our history. At the height of conflict, Americawould have ships on every ocean, and armies on five continents. And on the most crucial ofdays, would move the equivalent of a major city across the English Channel.And all these vast movements of men and armor were directed by one man who could notwalk on his own strength. President Roosevelt brought his own advantages to the job. Hisresolve was stronger than the will of any dictator. His belief in democracy was absolute. Hepossessed a daring that kept the enemy guessing. He spoke to Americans with an optimismthat lightened their task. And one of the saddest days of the war came just as it was ending,when the casualty notice in the morning paper began with the name, Franklin D. Roosevelt,Commander-in-Chief.Across the years, we still know his voice. And from his words, we know that he understood thecharacter of the American people. Dictators and their generals had dismissed Americans as nomatch for a master race. FDR answered them. In one of his radio addresses, he said, ""Wehave been described as a nation of weaklings, playboys. Let them tell that to GeneralMcArthur and his men. Let them tell that to the boys in the flying fortresses. Let them tell thatto the Marines.""In all, more than 16 million Americans would put on the uniform of the soldier, the sailor, theairman, the Marine, the Coast Guardsman or the Merchant Mariner. They came from citystreets and prairie towns, from public high schools and West Point. They were a modestbunch, and still are. The ranks were filled with men like Army Private Joe Sakato. In heavyfighting in France, he saw a good friend killed, and charged up a hill determined to shoot theones who did it. Private Sakato ran straight into enemy fire, killing 12, wounding two,capturing four, and inspiring his whole unit to take the hill and destroy the enemy. Lookingback on it 55 years later, Joe Sakato said, ""I'm not a hero. Nowadays they call what I did'road rage.'""This man's conduct that day gained him the Medal of Honor, one of 464 awarded for actions inWorld War II. Americans in uniform served bravely, fought fiercely and kept their honor --even under the worst of conditions. Yet they were not warriors by nature. All they wanted wasto finish the job and make it home.One soldier in the 58th Armor Field Artillery was known to have the best-kept rifle in the unit.He told his buddies he had plans for that weapon after the war. He said, ""I want to take ithome, cover it in salt, hang it on a wall in my living room so I can watch it rust.""These were the modest sons of a peaceful country, and millions of us are very proud to callthem Dad. They gave the best years of their lives to the greatest mission their country everaccepted. They faced the most extreme danger, which took some and spared others, forreasons only known to God. And wherever they advanced or touched ground, they areremembered for their goodness and their decency. A Polish man recalls being marchedthrough the German countryside in the last weeks of the war, when American forces suddenlyappeared. He said, ""Our two guards ran away. And this soldier with little blonde hair jumps offhis tank. 'You're free,' he shouts at us. We started hugging each other, crying and screaming,'God sent angels down to pick us up out of this hell place.'""Well, our boys weren't exactly angels. They were flesh and blood, with all the limits and fearsof flesh and blood. That only makes the achievement more remarkable -- the courage theyshowed, in a conflict that claimed more than 400,000 American lives, leaving so manyorphans and widows and Gold Star Mothers.The soldiers' story was best told by the great Ernie Pyle, who shared their lives and diedamong them. In his book, ""Here Is Your War,"" he described World War II as many veteransnow remember it. It is a picture, he wrote, ""of tired and dirty soldiers, who are alive and don'twant to die; of long, darkened convoys in the middle of the night; of shocked, silent menwandering back down the hill from battle; of Jeeps and petrol dumps and smelly bedding rolesand C-rations; and blown bridges and dead mules and hospital tents and shirt collars greasy-black from months of wearing; and of laughter, too, and anger, and wine, and lovely flowersand constant cussing. All these, it is composed of; and of graves and graves and graves.""On this Memorial Day weekend, the graves will be visited, and decorated with flowers andflags. Men whose step has slowed are thinking of boys they knew when they were boystogether. And women who watched the train leave, and the years pass, can still see thehandsome face of their young sweetheart. America will not forget them, either.At this place, at this Memorial, we acknowledge a debt of long-standing to an entiregeneration of Americans: those who died; those who fought and worked and grieved and wenton. They saved our country, and thereby saved the liberty of mankind. And now I ask everyman and woman who saw and lived World War II -- every member of that generation -- toplease rise as you are able, and receive the thanks of our great nation.May God bless you.",bush
"This is a sad hour in the life of America.A great American life has come to an end. I have just spoken to Nancy Reagan. On behalf ofour whole nation, Laura and I offered her and the Reagan family our prayers and ourcondolences. Ronald Reagan won America's respect with his greatness, and won its love with his goodness.He had the confidence that comes with conviction, the strength that comes with character, thegrace that comes with humility, and the humor that comes with wisdom. He leaves behind anation he restored and a world he helped save. During the years of President Reagan, America laid to rest an era of division and self-doubt.And because of his leadership, the world laid to rest an era of fear and tyranny. Now, in layingour leader to rest, we say thank you.He always told us that for America, the best was yet to come. We comfort ourselves in theknowledge that this is true for him, too. His work is done, and now a shining city awaits him. May God bless Ronald Reagan.",bush
"We lost Ronald Reagan only days ago, but we have missed him for a long time. We havemissed his kindly presence, that reassuring voice, and the happy ending we had wished forhim. It has been ten years since he said his own farewell; yet it is still very sad and hard to lethim go. Ronald Reagan belongs to the ages now, but we preferred it when he belonged to us. In a life of good fortune, he valued above all the gracious gift of his wife, Nancy. During hiscareer, Ronald Reagan passed through a thousand crowded places; but there was only oneperson, he said, who could make him lonely by just leaving the room. America honors you, Nancy, for the loyalty and love you gave this man on a wonderfuljourney, and to that journey's end. Today, our whole nation grieves with you and your family.When the sun sets tonight off the coast of California, and we lay to rest our 40th President, agreat American story will close. The second son of Nell and Jack Reagan first knew the worldas a place of open plains, quiet streets, gas-lit rooms, and carriages drawn by horse. If youcould go back to the Dixon, Illinois of 1922, you'd find a boy of 11 reading adventure storiesat the public library, or running with his brother, Neil, along Rock River, and coming home toa little house on Hennepin Avenue. That town was the kind of place you remember where youprayed side by side with your neighbors, and if things were going wrong for them, you prayedfor them, and knew they'd pray for you if things went wrong for you. The Reagan family would see its share of hardship, struggle and uncertainty. And out of thatcircumstance came a young man of steadiness, calm, and a cheerful confidence that life wouldbring good things. The qualities all of us have seen in Ronald Reagan were first spotted 70and 80 years ago. As a lifeguard in Lowell Park, he was the protector keeping an eye out fortrouble. As a sports announcer on the radio, he was the friendly voice that made you see thegame as he did. As an actor, he was the handsome, all-American, good guy, which, in hiscase, required knowing his lines -- and being himself. Along the way, certain convictions were formed and fixed in the man. Ronald Reagan believedthat everything happened for a reason, and that we should strive to know and do the will ofGod. He believed that the gentleman always does the kindest thing. He believed that peoplewere basically good, and had the right to be free. He believed that bigotry and prejudice werethe worst things a person could be guilty of. He believed in the Golden Rule and in the powerof prayer. He believed that America was not just a place in the world, but the hope of theworld. And he believed in taking a break now and then, because, as he said, there's nothing betterfor the inside of a man than the outside of a horse. Ronald Reagan spent decades in the film industry and in politics, fields known, on occasion, tochange a man. But not this man. From Dixon to Des Moines, to Hollywood to Sacramento, toWashington, D.C., all who met him remembered the same sincere, honest, upright fellow.Ronald Reagan's deepest beliefs never had much to do with fashion or convenience. Hisconvictions were always politely stated, affably argued, and as firm and straight as thecolumns of this cathedral.There came a point in Ronald Reagan's film career when people started seeing a futurebeyond the movies. The actor, Robert Cummings, recalled one occasion. ""I was sitting aroundthe set with all these people and we were listening to Ronnie, quite absorbed. I said, 'Ron,have you ever considered someday becoming President?' He said, 'President of what?''President of the United States,' I said. And he said, 'What's the matter, don't you like myacting either?'""The clarity and intensity of Ronald Reagan's convictions led to speaking engagements aroundthe country, and a new following he did not seek or expect. He often began his speeches bysaying, ""I'm going to talk about controversial things."" And then he spoke of communist rulersas slavemasters, of a government in Washington that had far overstepped its proper limits, ofa time for choosing that was drawing near. In the space of a few years, he took ideas andprinciples that were mainly found in journals and books, and turned them into a broad,hopeful movement ready to govern. As soon as Ronald Reagan became California's governor, observers saw a star in the West --tanned, well-tailored, in command, and on his way. In the 1960s, his friend, Bill Buckley,wrote, ""Reagan is indisputably a part of America, and he may become a part of Americanhistory."" Ronald Reagan's moment arrived in 1980. He came out ahead of some very good men,including one from Plains, and one from Houston. What followed was one of the decisivedecades of the century, as the convictions that shaped the President began to shape thetimes. He came to office with great hopes for America, and more than hopes -- like the President hehad revered and once saw in person, Franklin Roosevelt, Ronald Reagan matched anoptimistic temperament with bold, persistent action. President Reagan was optimistic aboutthe great promise of economic reform, and he acted to restore the reward and spirit ofenterprise. He was optimistic that a strong America could advance the peace, and he acted tobuild the strength that mission required. He was optimistic that liberty would thrive whereverit was planted, and he acted to defend liberty wherever it was threatened.And Ronald Reagan believed in the power of truth in the conduct of world affairs. When hesaw evil camped across the horizon, he called that evil by its name. There were no doubters inthe prisons and gulags, where dissidents spread the news, tapping to each other in code whatthe American President had dared to say. There were no doubters in the shipyards andchurches and secret labor meetings, where brave men and women began to hear the creakingand rumbling of a collapsing empire. And there were no doubters among those who swunghammers at the hated wall as the first and hardest blow had been struck by President RonaldReagan. The ideology he opposed throughout his political life insisted that history was moved byimpersonal ties and unalterable fates. Ronald Reagan believed instead in the courage andtriumph of free men. And we believe it, all the more, because we saw that courage in him. As he showed what a President should be, he also showed us what a man should be. RonaldReagan carried himself, even in the most powerful office, with a decency and attention tosmall kindnesses that also defined a good life. He was a courtly, gentle and considerate man,never known to slight or embarrass others. Many people across the country cherish letters hewrote in his own hand -- to family members on important occasions; to old friends dealingwith sickness and loss; to strangers with questions about his days in Hollywood. A boy oncewrote to him requesting federal assistance to help clean up his bedroom.The President replied that, ""unfortunately, funds are dangerously low."" He continued, ""I'msure your mother was fully justified in proclaiming your room a disaster. Therefore, you are inan excellent position to launch another volunteer program in our nation. Congratulations."" Sure, our 40th President wore his title lightly, and it fit like a white Stetson. In the end,through his belief in our country and his love for our country, he became an enduring symbolof our country. We think of his steady stride, that tilt of a head and snap of a salute, the big-screen smile, and the glint in his Irish eyes when a story came to mind. We think of a man advancing in years with the sweetness and sincerity of a Scout saying thePledge. We think of that grave expression that sometimes came over his face, the seriousnessof a man angered by injustice -- and frightened by nothing. We know, as he always said, thatAmerica's best days are ahead of us, but with Ronald Reagan's passing, some very fine daysare behind us, and that is worth our tears.Americans saw death approach Ronald Reagan twice, in a moment of violence, and then in theyears of departing light. He met both with courage and grace. In these trials, he showed howa man so enchanted by life can be at peace with life's end. And where does that strength come from? Where is that courage learned? It is the faith of aboy who read the Bible with his mom. It is the faith of a man lying in an operating room, whoprayed for the one who shot him before he prayed for himself. It is the faith of a man with afearful illness, who waited on the Lord to call him home. Now, death has done all that death can do. And as Ronald Wilson Reagan goes his way, weare left with the joyful hope he shared. In his last years, he saw through a glass darkly. Nowhe sees his Savior face to face. And we look to that fine day when we will see him again, all weariness gone, clear of mind,strong and sure, and smiling again, and the sorrow of his parting gone forever. May God bless Ronald Reagan, and the country he loved.",bush
"Mr. Chairman! Mr. Chairman, delegates, fellow citizens: I'm honored by your support, and Iaccept your nomination for President of the United States.When I -- When I said those words four years ago, none of us could have envisioned whatthese years would bring. In the heart of this great city, we saw tragedy arrive on a quietmorning. We saw the bravery of rescuers grow with danger. We learned of passengers on adoomed plane who died with a courage that frightened their killers. We have seen a shakeneconomy rise to its feet. And we have seen Americans in uniform storming mountainstrongholds, and charging through sandstorms, and liberating millions, with acts of valor thatwould make the men of Normandy proud.Since 2001, Americans have been given hills to climb, and found the strength to climb them.Now, because we have made the hard journey, we can see the valley below. Now, because wehave faced challenges with resolve, we have historic goals within our reach, and greatness inour future. We will build a safer world and a more hopeful America and nothing will hold usback.In the work we have done, and the work we will do, I am fortunate to have a superb VicePresident. I have counted on Dick Cheney's calm and steady judgment in difficult days, andI'm honored to have him at my side.I am grateful to share my walk in life with Laura Bush. Americans -- Americans have come tosee the goodness and kindness and strength I first saw 26 years ago, and we love our FirstLady.I'm a fortunate father of two spirited, intelligent, and lovely young women.I'm blessed with a sister and brothers who are my closest friends. And I will always be theproud and grateful son of George and Barbara Bush.My father served eight years at the side of another great American: Ronald Reagan. His -- Hisspirit of optimism and goodwill and decency are in this hall, and are in our hearts, and willalways define our Party.Two months from today, voters will make a choice based on the records we have built, theconvictions we hold, and the vision that guides us forward. A presidential election is a contestfor the future. Tonight I will tell you where I stand, what I believe, and where I will lead thiscountry in the next four years.I believe -- I believe every child can learn, and every school must teach, so we passed themost important federal education reform in history. Because we acted, children are makingsustained progress in reading and math, America's schools are getting better, and nothing willhold us back.I believe we have a moral responsibility to honor America's seniors, so I brought Republicansand Democrats together to strengthen Medicare. Now seniors are getting immediate helpbuying medicine. Soon every senior will be able to get prescription drug coverage, andnothing will hold us back.I believe in the energy and innovative spirit of America's workers, entrepreneurs, farmers, andranchers, so we unleashed that energy with the largest tax relief in a generation. Because weacted, our economy is growing again, and creating jobs, and nothing will hold us back.I believe the most solemn duty of the American president is to protect the American people. IfAmerica shows uncertainty or weakness in this decade, the world will drift toward tragedy.This will not happen on my watch.I'm running for President with a clear and positive plan to build a safer world, and a morehopeful America. I'm running with a compassionate conservative philosophy: that governmentshould help people improve their lives, not try to run their lives. I believe this Nation wantssteady, consistent, principled leadership and that is why, with your help, we will win thiselection.The story -- The story of America is the story of expanding liberty: an ever-widening circle,constantly growing to reach further and include more. Our Nation's founding commitment isstill our deepest commitment: In our world, and here at home, we will extend the frontiers offreedom.The times in which we live and work are changing dramatically. The workers of our parents'generation typically had one job, one skill, one career often with one company that providedhealth care and a pension. And most of those workers were men. Today, workers change jobs,even careers, many times during their lives, and in one of the most dramatic shifts our societyhas seen, two-thirds of all Moms also work outside the home. This changed world can be a time of great opportunity for all Americans to earn a betterliving, support your family, and have a rewarding career. And government must take yourside. Many of our most fundamental systems -- the tax code, health coverage, pension plans,worker training -- were created for the world of yesterday, not tomorrow. We will transformthese systems so that all citizens are equipped, prepared, and thus truly free to make yourown choices and pursue your own dreams.My plan begins with providing the security and opportunity of a growing economy. We nowcompete in a global market that provides new buyers for our goods, but new competition forour workers. To create more jobs in America, America must be the best place in the world todo business. To create jobs, my plan will encourage investment and expansion by restrainingfederal spending, reducing regulation, and making the tax relief permanent. To create jobs,we will make our country less dependent on foreign sources of energy. To create jobs, we willexpand trade and level the playing field to sell American goods and services across the globe.And we must protect small business owners and workers from the explosion of frivolouslawsuits that threaten jobs across our country.Another drag on our economy is the current tax code, which is a complicated mess filled withspecial interest loopholes, saddling our people with more than six billion hours of paperworkand headache every year. The American people deserve and our economic future demands asimpler, fairer, pro-growth system. In a new term, I will lead a bipartisan effort to reform andsimplify the federal tax code.Another priority in a new term will be to help workers take advantage of the expandingeconomy to find better and higher-paying jobs. In this time of change, many workers want togo back to school to learn different or higher-level skills. So we will double the number ofpeople served by our principal job training program and increase funding for our communitycolleges. I know that with the right skills, American workers can compete with anyone,anywhere in the world.In this time of change, opportunity in some communities is more distant than in others. Tostand with workers in poor communities and those that have lost manufacturing, textile, andother jobs we will create American opportunity zones. In these areas, we will provide tax reliefand other incentives to attract new business, and improve housing and job training to bringhope and work throughout all of America.As I've traveled the country, I've met many workers and small business owners who have toldme that they are worried they cannot afford health care. More than half of the uninsured aresmall business employees and their families. In a new term, we must allow small firms to jointogether to purchase insurance at the discounts available to big companies. We will offer a taxcredit to encourage small businesses and their employees to set up health savings accounts,and provide -- and provide direct help for low-income Americans to purchase them. Theseaccounts give workers the security of insurance against major illness, the opportunity to savetax-free for routine health expenses, and the freedom of knowing you can take your accountwith you whenever you change jobs. We will provide low-income Americans with better accessto health care: In a new term, I will ensure every poor county in America has a community orrural health center.As I've traveled our country, I've met too many good doctors, especially OBGYNS, who arebeing forced out of practice because of the high cost of lawsuits. To make health care moreaffordable and accessible, we must pass medical liability reform now. And in all we do toimprove health care in America, we will make sure that health decisions are made by doctorsand patients, not by bureaucrats in Washington, DC.In this time of change, government must take the side of working families. In a new term, wewill change outdated labor laws to offer comp-time and flex-time. Our laws should never standin the way of a more family-friendly workplace.Another priority for a new term is to build an ownership society, because ownership bringssecurity, and dignity, and independence. Thanks to our policies, homeownership in America isat an all-time high. Tonight we set a new goal: seven million more affordable homes in thenext 10 years so more American families will be able to open the door and say welcome to myhome.In an ownership society, more people will own their health care plans, and have theconfidence of owning a piece of their retirement. We'll always keep the promise of SocialSecurity for our older workers. With the huge Baby Boom generation approaching retirement,many of our children and grandchildren understandably worry whether Social Security will bethere when they need it. We must strengthen Social Security by allowing younger workers tosave some of their taxes in a personal -- personal account, a nest egg you can call your own,and government can never take away.In all these proposals, we seek to provide not just a government program, but a path -- apath to greater opportunity, more freedom, and more control over your own life. And the pathbegins with our youngest Americans. To build a more hopeful America, we must help ourchildren reach as far as their vision and character can take them. Tonight, I remind everyparent and every teacher, I say to every child: No matter what your circumstance, no matterwhere you live, your school will be the path to promise of America.We are transforming our schools by raising standards and focusing on results. We are insistingon accountability, empowering parents and teachers, and making sure that local people are incharge of their schools. By testing every child, we are identifying those who need help -- andwe are providing a record level of funding to get them that help. In northeast Georgia,Gainesville Elementary School is mostly Hispanic and 90 percent poor -- and this year 90percent of its students passed state tests in reading and math. The principal -- The principalexpresses the philosophy of his school this way: ""We don't focus on what we can't do at thisschool; we focus on what we can do. And we do whatever it takes to get kids across the finishline."" See, this principal is challenging the soft bigotry of low expectations, and that is thespirit of our education reform, and the commitment of our country: No dejaremos a ningnnio atrs. ""We will leave no child behind.""We are making progress -- We are making and there is more to do. In this time of change,most new jobs are filled by people with at least two years of college, yet only about one infour students gets there. In our high schools, we will fund early intervention programs to helpstudents at risk. We will place a new focus on math and science. As we make progress, we willrequire a rigorous exam before graduation. By raising performance in our high schools, andexpanding Pell grants for low and middle income families, we will help more Americans starttheir career with a college diploma.America's children must also have a healthy start in life. In a new term, we will lead anaggressive effort to enroll millions of poor children who are eligible but not signed up for thegovernment's health insurance programs. We will not allow a lack of attention, or information,to stand between these children and the health care they need.Anyone who wants more details on my agenda can find 'em online. The web address is notvery imaginative, but it's easy to remember: GeorgeWBush.com.These changing times can be exciting times of expanded opportunity. And here, you face achoice. My opponent's policies are dramatically different from ours. Senator Kerry opposedMedicare reform and health savings accounts. After supporting my education reforms, he nowwants to dilute 'em. He opposes legal and medical liability reform. He opposed reducing themarriage penalty, opposed doubling the child credit, opposed lowering income taxes for allwho pay them. (Wait a minute. Wait a minute.) To be fair, there are some things myopponent is for. He's -- He's proposed more than two trillion dollars in federal spending so far,and that's a lot, even for a senator from Massachusetts. And to pay for that spending, he isrunnin' on a platform of increasing taxes, and that's the kind of promise a politician usuallykeeps.His tax and -- His policies of tax and spend, of expanding government rather than expandingopportunity are the politics of the past. We are on the path to the future and we're not turningback.In this world of change, some things do not change: the values we try to live by, theinstitutions that give our lives meaning and purpose. Our society rests on a foundation ofresponsibility and character and family commitment.Because family and work are sources of stability and dignity, I support welfare reform thatstrengthens family and requires work. Because a caring society will value its weakestmembers, we must make a place for the unborn child. Because -- Because religious charitiesprovide a safety net of mercy and compassion, our government must never discriminateagainst them. Because the union of a man and woman deserves an honored place in oursociety, I support the protection of marriage against activist judges. And I will continue toappoint federal judges who know the difference between personal opinion and the strictinterpretation of the law.My opponent recently announced that he's the conservative -- the candidate of ""conservativevalues."" Must have come as a surprise to a lot of his supporters. There are some problemswith this claim. If you say the heart and soul of America is found in Hollywood, I'm afraid youare not the candidate of conservative values. If -- If you voted against the bipartisan Defenseof Marriage Act, which President Clinton signed, you are not the candidate of conservativevalues. If you gave a speech, as my opponent did, calling the Reagan presidency eight yearsof ""moral darkness,"" then you may be a lot of things, but the candidate of conservative valuesis not one of them.This election will also determine how America responds to the continuing danger of terrorism.And you know where I stand. Three days after September the 11th, I stood where Americansdied, in the ruins of the Twin Towers. Workers in hard hats were shouting to me, ""Whatever ittakes."" A fellow grabbed me by the arm and he said, ""Do not let me down."" Since that day, Iwake up every morning thinking about how to better protect our country. I will never relent indefending America whatever it takes.So we have fought the terrorists across the earth not for pride, not for power, but because thelives of our citizens are at stake. Our strategy is clear. We've tripled funding for homelandsecurity and trained a half a million first responders, because we're determined to protect ourhomeland. We're transforming our military and reforming and strengthening our intelligenceservices. We are staying on the offensive, striking terrorists abroad, so we do not have to facethem here at home. And we are working to advance liberty in the broader Middle East,because freedom will bring a future of hope, and the peace we all want. And we will prevail.Our strategy is succeeding. Four years ago, Afghanistan was the home base of al-Qaida;Pakistan was a transit point for terrorist groups; Saudi Arabia was fertile ground for terroristfundraising; Libya was secretly pursuing nucular [nuclear] weapons; Iraq was a gatheringthreat; and al-Qaida was largely unchallenged as it planned attacks.Today, the government of -- of a free Afghanistan is fighting terror; Pakistan is capturingterrorist leaders; Saudi Arabia is making raids and arrests; Libya is dismantling its weaponsprograms; the army of a free Iraq is fighting for freedom; and more than three-quarters of al-Qaida's key members and associates have been detained or killed. We have led; many havejoined; and America and the world are safer.This progress involved careful diplomacy, clear moral purpose, and some tough decisions. Andthe toughest came on Iraq. We knew Saddam Hussein's record of aggression and support forterror. We knew his long history of pursuing, even using, weapons of mass destruction. Andwe know that September the 11th requires our country to think differently: We must, and wewill, confront threats to America before it is too late.In Saddam Hussein, we saw a threat. Members of both political parties, including --. Membersof both political parties, including my opponent and his running mate, saw the threat, andvoted to authorize the use of force. We went to the United Nations Security Council, whichpassed a unanimous resolution demanding the dictator disarm, or face serious consequences.Leaders in the Middle East urged him to comply. After more than a decade of diplomacy, wegave Saddam Hussein another chance, a final chance, to meet his responsibilities to thecivilized world. He again refused, and I faced the kind of decision that comes only to the OvalOffice, a decision no president would ask for, but must be prepared to make. Do I forget thelessons of September the 11th and take the word of a madman, or do I take action to defendour country? Faced with that choice, I will defend America every time.Because we acted to defend our country, the murderous regimes of Saddam Hussein and theTaliban are history, more than 50 million people have been liberated, and democracy iscoming to the broader Middle East. In Afghanistan, terrorists have done everything they canto intimidate people, yet more than 10 million citizens have registered to vote in the Octoberpresidential election -- a resounding endorsement for democracy. Despite ongoing acts ofviolence, Iraq now has a strong Prime Minister, a national council, and national elections arescheduled for January. Our Nation is standing with the people of Afghanistan and Iraq,because when America gives its word, America must keep its word.As importantly, we are serving a vital and historic cause that will make our country safer. Freesocieties in the Middle East will be hopeful societies, which no longer feed resentments andbreed violence for export. Free governments in the Middle East will fight terrorists instead ofharboring them, and that helps us keep the peace.So our mission in Afghanistan and Iraq is clear: We will help new leaders to train their armies,and move toward elections, and get on the path of stability and democracy as quickly aspossible. And then our troops will return home with the honor they have earned. Our troops know the historic importance of our work. One Army Specialist wrote home: ""Weare transforming a once sick society into a hopeful place. The various terrorist enemies weare facing in Iraq,"" he continued, ""are really aiming at you back in the United States. This is atest of will for our country. We soldiers of yours are doing great and scoring victories inconfronting the evil terrorists."" That young man is right -- our men and women in uniform aredoing a superb job for America.Tonight I want to speak to all of them and to their families: You are involved in a struggle ofhistoric proportion. Because of your service and sacrifice, we are defeating the terroristswhere they live and plan, and you're making America safer. Because of you, women inAfghanistan are no longer shot in a sports stadium. Because of you, the people of Iraq nolonger fear being executed and left in mass graves. Because of you, the world is more justand will be more peaceful. We owe you our thanks, and we owe you something more. We willgive you all the resources, all the tools, and all the support you need for victory.Again -- Again my opponent and I have different approaches. I proposed, and the Congressoverwhelmingly passed, 87 billion dollars in funding needed by our troops doing battle inAfghanistan and Iraq. My opponent and his running mate voted against this money for bullets,and fuel, and vehicles, and body armor. When asked to explain his vote, the Senator said, ""Iactually did vote for the 87 billion dollars before I voted against it."" Then he said -- Then hesaid he was ""proud"" of his vote. Then, when pressed, he said it was a ""complicated"" matter.There's nothing complicated about supporting our troops in combat.Our allies also know the historic importance of our work. About 40 nations stand beside us inAfghanistan, and some 30 in Iraq. I deeply appreciate the courage and wise counsel of leaderslike Prime Minister Howard, President Kwasniewski, Prime Minister Berlusconi and, of course,Prime Minister Tony Blair. Again, my opponent takes a different approach. In the midst of war, he has called Americanallies, quote, a ""coalition of the coerced and the bribed."" That would be nations like GreatBritain, Poland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Denmark, El Salvador, Australia, and others --allies that deserve the respect of all Americans, not the scorn of a politician.I respect every soldier, from every country, who serves beside us in the hard work of history.America is grateful, and America will not forget.The people we have freed won't forget either. Not long ago, seven Iraqi men came to see mein the Oval Office. They had ""X""s branded into their foreheads, and their right hands had beencut off by Saddam Hussein's secret police, the sadistic punishment for imaginary crimes.During our emotional visit one of the Iraqi men used his new prosthetic hand to slowly writeout, in Arabic, a prayer for God to bless America. I am proud that our country remains thehope of the oppressed, and the greatest force for good on this earth. Others understand the historic importance of our work. The terrorists know. They know that avibrant, successful democracy at the heart of the Middle East will discredit their radicalideology of hate. They know that men and women with hope and purpose and dignity do notstrap bombs on their bodies and kill the innocent. The terrorists are fighting freedom with alltheir cunning and cruelty because freedom is their greatest fear, and they should be afraid,because freedom is on the march.I believe in the transformational power of liberty: The wisest use of American strength is toadvance freedom. As the citizens of Afghanistan and Iraq seize the moment, their examplewill send a message of hope throughout a vital region. Palestinians will hear the message thatdemocracy and reform are within their reach, and so is peace with our good friend Israel.Young women across the Middle East will hear the message that their day of equality andjustice is coming. Young men will hear the message that national progress and dignity arefound in liberty, not tyranny and terror. Reformers and political prisoners and exiles will hearthe message that their dream of freedom cannot be denied forever. And as freedom advancesheart by heart, and nation by nation America will be more secure and the world morepeaceful.America has done this kind of work before and there have always been doubters. In 1946, 18months after the fall of Berlin to allied forces, a journalist in the New York Times wrote this:""Germany is a land in an acute stage of economic, political and moral crisis. European capitalsare frightened. In every military headquarters, one meets alarmed officials doing their utmostto deal with the consequences of the occupation policy that they admit has failed.""End quote.Maybe that same person is still around, writing editorials. Fortunately, we had a resolutepresident named Truman, who, with the American people, persevered -- knowing that a newdemocracy at the center of Europe would lead to stability and peace. And because thatgeneration of Americans held firm in the cause of liberty, we live in a better and safer worldtoday.The progress we and our friends and allies seek in the broader Middle East will not comeeasily, or all at once. Yet Americans, of all people, should never be surprised by the power ofliberty to transform lives and nations.That power brought settlers on perilous journeys, inspired colonies to rebellion, ended the sinof slavery, and set our Nation against the tyrannies of the 20th century. We were honored toaid the rise of democracy in Germany and Japan, Nicaragua, Central Europe and the Baltics.And that noble story goes on.I believe that America is called to lead the cause of freedom in a new century. I believe that millions in the Middle East plead in silence for their liberty. I believe that given the chance, they will embrace the most honorable form of governmentever devised by man. I believe all these things because freedom is not America's gift to the world, it is the AlmightyGod's gift to every man and woman in this world.This moment in the life of our country will be remembered. Generations will know if we keptour faith and kept our word. Generations will know if we seized this moment and used it tobuild a future of safety and peace. The freedom of many, and the future security of ourNation, now depend on us. And tonight, my fellow Americans, I ask you to stand with me.In the last four years -- In the last four years, you and I have come to know each other. Evenwhen we don't agree, at least you know what I believe and where I stand.You may have noticed I have a few flaws, too. People sometimes have to correct my English. Iknew I had a problem when Arnold Schwarzenegger started doing it. Some folks look at meand see a certain swagger, which in Texas is called ""walking."" Now and then I come across asa little too blunt and for that we can all thank the white-haired lady sitting right up there.One thing I have learned about the presidency is that whatever shortcomings you have,people are going to notice them and whatever strengths you have, you're gonna need 'em.These four years have brought moments I could not foresee and will not forget. I've tried tocomfort Americans who lost the most on September the 11th -- people who showed me apicture or told me a story, so I'd -- I would know how much was taken from them. I'velearned first-hand that ordering Americans into battle is the hardest decision, even when it isright. I have returned the salute of wounded soldiers, some with a very tough road ahead,who say they were just doing their job. I've held the children of the fallen, who were told theirdad or mom is a hero, but would rather just have their mom or dad.I've met with the parents and wives and husbands who have received a folded flag, and said afinal goodbye to a soldier they loved. I am awed that so many have used those meetings tosay that I'm in their prayers -- and to offer encouragement to me. Where does that strengthlike that come from? How can people so burdened with sorrow also feel such pride? It isbecause they know their loved one was last seen doing good. Because they know that libertywas precious to the one they lost. And in those military families, I have seen the character ofa great nation: decent, idealistic, and strong.The world saw that spirit three miles from here, when the people of this city faced periltogether, and lifted a flag over the ruins, and defied the enemy with their courage. My fellow Americans, for as long as our country stands, people will look to the resurrection ofNew York City and they will say: Here buildings fell; here a nation rose.We see America's character in our military, which finds a way or makes one.We see it in our veterans, who are supporting military families in their days of worry.We see it in our young people, who have found heroes once again.We see that character in workers and entrepreneurs, who are renewing our economy withtheir effort and optimism.And all of this has confirmed one belief beyond doubt: Having come this far, our tested andconfident Nation can achieve anything.To everything we know there is a season -- a time for sadness, a time for struggle, a time forrebuilding. And now we have reached a time for hope.This young century will be liberty's century. By promoting liberty abroad, we will build a saferworld. By encouraging liberty at home, we will build a more hopeful America. Like generationsbefore us, we have a calling from beyond the stars to stand for freedom. This is theeverlasting dream of America and tonight, in this place, that dream is renewed.Now we go forward grateful for our freedom, faithful to our cause, and confident in the futureof the greatest nation on earth.God bless you, and may God continue to bless our great country.Thank you all.",bush
"Thank you for the honor of addressing this General Assembly. The American people respectthe idealism that gave life to this organization. And we respect the men and women of theU.N., who stand for peace and human rights in every part of the world. Welcome to New YorkCity, and welcome to the United States of America.During the past three years, I've addressed this General Assembly in a time of tragedy for mycountry, and in times of decision for all of us. Now we gather at a time of tremendousopportunity for the U.N. and for all peaceful nations. For decades, the circle of liberty andsecurity and development has been expanding in our world. This progress has brought unityto Europe, self-government to Latin America and Asia, and new hope to Africa. Now we havethe historic chance to widen the circle even further, to fight radicalism and terror with justiceand dignity, to achieve a true peace, founded on human freedom.The United Nations and my country share the deepest commitments. Both the AmericanDeclaration of Independence and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaim theequal value and dignity of every human life. That dignity is honored by the rule of law, limitson the power of the state, respect for women, protection of private property, free speech,equal justice, and religious tolerance. That dignity is dishonored by oppression, corruption,tyranny, bigotry, terrorism and all violence against the innocent. And both of our foundingdocuments affirm that this bright line between justice and injustice -- between right andwrong -- is the same in every age, and every culture, and every nation.Wise governments also stand for these principles for very practical and realistic reasons. Weknow that dictators are quick to choose aggression, while free nations strive to resolvedifferences in peace. We know that oppressive governments support terror, while freegovernments fight the terrorists in their midst. We know that free peoples embrace progressand life, instead of becoming the recruits for murderous ideologies.Every nation that wants peace will share the benefits of a freer world. And every nation thatseeks peace has an obligation to help build that world. Eventually, there is no safe isolationfrom terror networks, or failed states that shelter them, or outlaw regimes, or weapons ofmass destruction. Eventually, there is no safety in looking away, seeking the quiet life byignoring the struggles and oppression of others.In this young century, our world needs a new definition of security. Our security is not merelyfound in spheres of influence, or some balance of power. The security of our world is found inthe advancing rights of mankind.These rights are advancing across the world -- and across the world, the enemies of humanrights are responding with violence. Terrorists and their allies believe the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights and the American Bill of Rights, and every charter of liberty everwritten, are lies, to be burned and destroyed and forgotten. They believe that dictators shouldcontrol every mind and tongue in the Middle East and beyond. They believe that suicide andtorture and murder are fully justified to serve any goal they declare. And they act on theirbeliefs.In the last year alone, terrorists have attacked police stations, and banks, and commutertrains, and synagogues -- and a school filled with children. This month in Beslan we saw, onceagain, how the terrorists measure their success -- in the death of the innocent, and in the painof grieving families.Svetlana Dzebisov was held hostage, along with her son and her nephew -- her nephew didnot survive. She recently visited the cemetery, and saw what she called the ""little graves.""She said, ""I understand that there is evil in the world. But what have these little creaturesdone?""Members of the United Nations, the Russian children did nothing to deserve such awfulsuffering, and fright, and death. The people of Madrid and Jerusalem and Istanbul andBaghdad have done nothing to deserve sudden and random murder. These acts violate thestandards of justice in all cultures, and the principles of all religions. All civilized nations are inthis struggle together, and all must fight the murderers.We're determined to destroy terror networks wherever they operate, and the United States isgrateful to every nation that is helping to seize terrorist assets, track down their operatives,and disrupt their plans. We're determined to end the state sponsorship of terror -- and mynation is grateful to all that participated in the liberation of Afghanistan. We're determined toprevent proliferation, and to enforce the demands of the world -- and my nation is grateful tothe soldiers of many nations who have helped to deliver the Iraqi people from an outlawdictator.The dictator agreed in 1991, as a condition of a cease-fire, to fully comply with all SecurityCouncil resolutions -- then ignored more than a decade of those resolutions. Finally, theSecurity Council promised serious consequences for his defiance. And the commitments wemake must have meaning. When we say ""serious consequences,"" for the sake of peace, theremust be serious consequences. And so a coalition of nations enforced the just demands of theworld.Defending our ideals is vital, but it is not enough. Our broader mission as U.N. members is toapply these ideals to the great issues of our time. Our wider goal is to promote hope andprogress as the alternatives to hatred and violence. Our great purpose is to build a betterworld beyond the war on terror.Because we believe in human dignity, America and many nations have established a globalfund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. In three years the contributing countries havefunded projects in more than 90 countries, and pledged a total of $5.6 billion to these efforts.America has undertaken a $15 billion effort to provide prevention and treatment and humanecare in nations afflicted by AIDS, placing a special focus on 15 countries where the need ismost urgent. AIDS is the greatest health crisis of our time, and our unprecedentedcommitment will bring new hope to those who have walked too long in the shadow of death.Because we believe in human dignity, America and many nations have joined together toconfront the evil of trafficking in human beings. We're supporting organizations that rescuethe victims, passing stronger anti-trafficking laws, and warning travelers that they will be heldto account for supporting this modern form of slavery. Women and children should never beexploited for pleasure or greed, anywhere on Earth.Because we believe in human dignity, we should take seriously the protection of life fromexploitation under any pretext. In this session, the U.N. will consider a resolution sponsoredby Costa Rica calling for a comprehensive ban on human cloning. I support that resolution andurge all governments to affirm a basic ethical principle: No human life should ever beproduced or destroyed for the benefit of another.Because we believe in human dignity, America and many nations have changed the way wefight poverty, curb corruption, and provide aid. In 2002 we created the Monterrey Consensus,a bold approach that links new aid from developed nations to real reform in developing ones.And through the Millennium Challenge Account, my nation is increasing our aid to developingnations that expand economic freedom and invest in the education and health of their ownpeople.Because we believe in human dignity, America and many nations have acted to lift thecrushing burden of debt that limits the growth of developing economies, and holds millions ofpeople in poverty. Since these efforts began in 1996, poor countries with the heaviest debtburdens have received more than $30 billion of relief. And to prevent the build-up of futuredebt, my country and other nations have agreed that international financial institutions shouldincreasingly provide new aid in the form of grants, rather than loans.Because we believe in human dignity, the world must have more effective means to stabilizeregions in turmoil, and to halt religious violence and ethnic cleansing. We must createpermanent capabilities to respond to future crises. The United States and Italy have proposeda Global Peace Operations Initiative. G-8 countries will train 75,000 peacekeepers, initiallyfrom Africa, so they can conduct operations on that continent and elsewhere. The countries ofthe G-8 will help this peacekeeping force with deployment and logistical needs.At this hour, the world is witnessing terrible suffering and horrible crimes in the Darfur regionof Sudan, crimes my government has concluded are genocide. The United States played a keyrole in efforts to broker a cease-fire, and we're providing humanitarian assistance to theSudanese people. Rwanda and Nigeria have deployed forces in Sudan to help improve securityso aid can be delivered.The Security Council adopted a new resolution that supports an expanded African Union forceto help prevent further bloodshed, and urges the government of Sudan to stop flights bymilitary aircraft in Darfur. We congratulate the members of the Council on this timely andnecessary action. I call on the government of Sudan to honor the cease-fire it signed, and tostop the killing in Darfur.Because we believe in human dignity, peaceful nations must stand for the advance ofdemocracy. No other system of government has done more to protect minorities, to securethe rights of labor, to raise the status of women, or to channel human energy to the pursuitsof peace. We've witnessed the rise of democratic governments in predominantly Hindu andMuslim, Buddhist, Jewish and Christian cultures. Democratic institutions have taken root inmodern societies, and in traditional societies. When it comes to the desire for liberty andjustice, there is no clash of civilizations. People everywhere are capable of freedom, andworthy of freedom.Finding the full promise of representative government takes time, as America has found in twocenturies of debate and struggle. Nor is there any -- only one form of representativegovernment -- because democracies, by definition, take on the unique character of thepeoples that create them. Yet this much we know with certainty: The desire for freedomresides in every human heart. And that desire cannot be contained forever by prison walls, ormartial laws, or secret police. Over time, and across the Earth, freedom will find a way.Freedom is finding a way in Iraq and Afghanistan -- and we must continue to show ourcommitment to democracies in those nations. The liberty that many have won at a cost mustbe secured. As members of the United Nations, we all have a stake in the success of theworld's newest democracies.Not long ago, outlaw regimes in Baghdad and Kabul threatened the peace and sponsoredterrorists. These regimes destabilized one of the world's most vital -- and most volatile --regions. They brutalized their peoples, in defiance of all civilized norms. Today, the Iraqi andAfghan people are on the path to democracy and freedom. The governments that are risingwill pose no threat to others. Instead of harboring terrorists, they're fighting terrorist groups.And this progress is good for the long-term security of us all.The Afghan people are showing extraordinary courage under difficult conditions. They'refighting to defend their nation from Taliban holdouts, and helping to strike against theterrorists killers. They're reviving their economy. They've adopted a constitution that protectsthe rights of all, while honoring their nation's most cherished traditions.More than 10 million Afghan citizens -- over 4 million of them women -- are now registered tovote in next month's presidential election. To any who still would question whether Muslimsocieties can be democratic societies, the Afghan people are giving their answer.Since the last meeting of this General Assembly, the people of Iraq have regainedsovereignty. Today, in this hall, the Prime Minister of Iraq and his delegation represent acountry that has rejoined the community of nations. The government of Prime Minister Allawihas earned the support of every nation that believes in self-determination and desires peace.And under Security Council resolutions 1511 and 1546, the world is providing that support.The U.N., and its member nations, must respond to Prime Minister Allawi's request, and domore to help build an Iraq that is secure, democratic, federal, and free.A democratic Iraq has ruthless enemies, because terrorists know the stakes in that country.They know that a free Iraq in the heart of the Middle East will be a decisive blow against theirambitions for that region. So a terrorists group associated with al Qaeda is now one of themain groups killing the innocent in Iraq today -- conducting a campaign of bombings againstcivilians, and the beheadings of bound men. Coalition forces now serving in Iraq areconfronting the terrorists and foreign fighters, so peaceful nations around the world will neverhave to face them within our own borders.Our coalition is standing beside a growing Iraqi security force. The NATO Alliance is providingvital training to that force. More than 35 nations have contributed money and expertise tohelp rebuild Iraq's infrastructure. And as the Iraqi interim government moves toward nationalelections, officials from the United Nations are helping Iraqis build the infrastructure ofdemocracy. These selfless people are doing heroic work, and are carrying on the great legacyof Sergio de Mello.As we have seen in other countries, one of the main terrorist goals is to undermine, disrupt,and influence election outcomes. We can expect terrorist attacks to escalate as Afghanistanand Iraq approach national elections. The work ahead is demanding. But these difficulties willnot shake our conviction that the future of Afghanistan and Iraq is a future of liberty. Theproper response to difficulty is not to retreat, it is to prevail.The advance of freedom always carries a cost, paid by the bravest among us. America mournsthe losses to our nation, and to many others. And today, I assure every friend of Afghanistanand Iraq, and every enemy of liberty: We will stand with the people of Afghanistan and Iraquntil their hopes of freedom and security are fulfilled.These two nations will be a model for the broader Middle East, a region where millions havebeen denied basic human rights and simple justice. For too long, many nations, including myown, tolerated, even excused, oppression in the Middle East in the name of stability.Oppression became common, but stability never arrived. We must take a different approach.We must help the reformers of the Middle East as they work for freedom, and strive to build acommunity of peaceful, democratic nations.This commitment to democratic reform is essential to resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict. Peacewill not be achieved by Palestinian rulers who intimidate opposition, tolerate corruption, andmaintain ties to terrorist groups. The longsuffering Palestinian people deserve better. Theydeserve true leaders capable of creating and governing a free and peaceful Palestinian state.Even after the setbacks and frustrations of recent months, goodwill and hard effort canachieve the promise of the road map to peace. Those who would lead a new Palestinian stateshould adopt peaceful means to achieve the rights of their people, and create the reformedinstitutions of a stable democracy. Arab states should end incitement in their own media, cutoff public and private funding for terrorism, and establish normal relations with Israel. Israelshould impose a settlement freeze, dismantle unauthorized outposts, end the daily humiliationof the Palestinian people, and avoid any actions that prejudice final negotiations. And worldleaders should withdraw all favor and support from any Palestinian ruler who fails his peopleand betrays their cause.The democratic hopes we see growing in the Middle East are growing everywhere. In thewords of the Burmese democracy advocate, Aung San Suu Kyi:We do not accept the notion that democracy is a Western value. To the contrary,democracy simply means good government rooted in responsibility, transparency, andaccountability.1Here at the United Nations, you know this to be true. In recent years, this organization hashelped create a new democracy in East Timor, and the U.N. has aided other nations in makingthe transition to self-rule.Because I believe the advance of liberty is the path to both a safer and better world, today Ipropose establishing a Democracy Fund within the United Nations. This is a great calling forthis great organization.The fund would help countries lay the foundations of democracy by instituting the rule of lawand independent courts, a free press, political parties and trade unions. Money from the fundwould also help set up voter precincts and polling places, and support the work of electionmonitors. To show our commitment to the new Democracy Fund, the United States will makean initial contribution. I urge other nations to contribute, as well.Today, I've outlined a broad agenda to advance human dignity, and enhance the security ofall of us. The defeat of terror, the protection of human rights, the spread of prosperity, theadvance of democracy -- these causes, these ideals, call us to great work in the world. Each ofus alone can only do so much. Together, we can accomplish so much more.History will honor the high ideals of this organization. The charter states them with clarity: ""tosave succeeding generations from the scourge of war,"" ""to reaffirm faith in fundamentalhuman rights,"" ""to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom.""Let history also record that our generation of leaders followed through on these ideals, even inadversity. Let history show that in a decisive decade, members of the United Nations did notgrow weary in our duties, or waver in meeting them. I'm confident that this young century willbe liberty's century. I believe we will rise to this moment, because I know the character of somany nations and leaders represented here today. And I have faith in the transforming powerof freedom.May God bless you.",bush

And because you did the incredible work, we are celebrating today.There's an old saying, ""Do not pray for tasks equal to your powers; pray for powers equal toyour tasks.""In four historic years, America has been given great tasks and faced them with strength andcourage.Our people have restored the vigor of this economy and shown resolve and patience in a newkind of war.Our military has brought justice to the enemy and honor to America.Our nation -- Our nation has defended itself and served the freedom of all mankind. I'm proudto lead such an amazing country, and I am proud to lead it forward.Because we have done the hard work, we are entering a season of hope. We'll continue oureconomic progress.We'll reform our outdated tax code. We'll strengthen the Social Security for the nextgeneration.We'll make public schools all they can be, and we will uphold our deepest values of family andfaith.We'll help the emerging democracies of Iraq and Afghanistan, so they can grow in strengthand defend their freedom, and then our servicemen and women will come home with thehonor they have earned.With good allies at our side, we will fight this war on terror with every resource of our nationalpower, so our children can live in freedom and in peace.Reaching these goals will require the broad support of Americans, so today I want to speak toevery person who voted for my opponent. To make this nation stronger and better, I will needyour support and I will work to earn it. I will do all I can do to deserve your trust.A new term is a new opportunity to reach out to the whole nation. We have one country, oneconstitution, and one future that binds us. And when we come together and work together,there is no limit to the greatness of America.Let me close with a word to the people of the state of Texas. We have known each other thelongest, and you started me on this journey. On the open plains of Texas, I first learned thecharacter of our country -- sturdy and honest, and as hopeful as the break of day. I willalways be grateful to the good people of my State. And whatever the road that lies ahead,that road will take me home.A campaign has ended, and the United States of America goes forward with confidence andfaith.I see a great day coming for our country, and I am eager for the work ahead.God bless you. And may God bless America.",bush
"Please be seated. Thank you all very much. Thanks for the warm welcome. Mr. Prime Minister,thank you, and Mrs. Martin, for a fantastic dinner last night in Ottawa. We really loved it. Myonly regret today is that Laura is not with me. She is -- went home to thank those who havebeen decorating the White House for the great Christmas season that's coming up. I marriedwell.I appreciate the Premiers who are here. Premier Hamm, thank you for your hospitality.Premier Lord, Premier Binns, and Premier Williams, I appreciate you all joining. I want tospecifically mention the Premiers 'cause, as an ex-governor, I feel a special kinship to thosewho run the provinces here in Canada. But thank you for your service. Ambassador Cellucci,mayors, local officials, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, I am honored to be withyou today to reaffirm America's enduring ties to your country. I am really glad to be inCanada, and I'm really glad to be among friends. I appreciate the warm hospitality we've received.In the past year, I've come to know your new Prime Minister. We've met in Mexico, in theUnited States, in Chile, and now in Canada. Paul Martin is a leader who is asserting Canada'sgood influence in the world. And as I prepare for a second term in office, I look forward to asuccessful working partnership between our two countries.Paul and I share a great vision for the future, two prosperous, independent nations joinedtogether by the return of NHL hockey.I told Paul that I really have only one regret about this visit to Canada. There's a prominentcitizen who endorsed me in the 2000 election, and I wanted a chance to finally thank him forthat -- that endorsement. I was hoping to meet Jean Poutine.I'm proud to stand in this historic place, which has welcomed home so many Canadians whodefended liberty overseas, and where so many new Canadians began their North Americandream. I'm grateful for the hospitality shown by the people of this fine city who have been sovery kind to Americans before.Three years ago, Halifax and other towns and villages -- from Newfoundland to Manitoba tothe Northwest Territories to British Columbia -- welcomed, as the Prime Minister mentioned,more than 33,000 passengers on diverted flights. For days after September the 11th,Canadians came to the aid of men and women and children who were worried and confusedand had nowhere to sleep. You opened your homes and your churches to strangers. Youbrought food; you set up clinics; you arranged for calls to their loved ones, and you asked fornothing in return.One American declared, ""My heart is overwhelmed at the outpouring of Canadian compassion.How does a person say 'thank you' to a nation?"" Well, that's something a President can do.And so let me say directly to the Canadian people, and to all of you here today who welcomedAmericans, thank you for your kindness to America in an hour of need.  That emergency revealed the good and generous heart of this country, and showed the truefeelings of Canadians and Americans toward each other. The affection that appeared in aninstant will always be there, and it runs deep. Beyond the words of politicians and the naturaldisagreements that nations will have, our two peoples are one family, and always will be.We're united in part by the daily contact of commerce, and both our nations are better off forit. In the 10 years since the North American Free Trade Agreement was enacted, tradebetween the United States and Canada has nearly doubled. Twenty-three percent of America'sexports go directly north; and more than 80 percent of Canadians' exports go to my country.With so much trade, there are bound to be some disagreements. I proudly ate some Albertabeef last night and I'm still standing. With determined efforts, and relying on sound scienceand mutual goodwill, we can resolve issues. Take, for example, those PEI potatoes. Right, Mr.Premier?Canada represents America's most vital trade relationship in the whole world, and we will doall that is necessary to keep that relationship strong.Yet, our ties go deeper than trade. Our community of values reaches back centuries. Canadaand the U.S. may have disagreed on the wisdom of separating from the Crown, but we'vealways agreed on the great principles of liberty derived from our common heritage. Webelieve in the dignity of every human life, and we believe in the right of every person to live infreedom. We believe in free markets, humanized by compassion and fairness. We believe adiverse society can also be united by principles of justice and equality. The values we holdhave made us good neighbors for centuries, and they will keep us as strong allies and goodfriends for the centuries to come.These shared convictions have also led our great democracies to accept a mission in the widerworld. We know it is not possible to live in quiet isolation of our peaceful continent, hoping theproblems and challenges of other nations will pass us by. We know there can be no security,no lasting peace in a world where proliferation and terrorism, and genocide, and extremepoverty go unopposed.We know that our own interests are served by an international system that advances humanrights, and open societies, and free trade, and the rule of law, and the hope that comes fromself-government. Both Canada and the United States have accepted important global duties,and we will meet those responsibilities, for our own benefit and for the good of mankind.Canada's leadership is helping to build a better world. Over the past decade, Canadian troopshave helped bring stability to Bosnia and Kosovo. Canada's willingness to send peacekeepersto Haiti saved thousands of lives and helped save Haiti's constitutional government. Canadiantroops are serving bravely in Afghanistan at this hour. Other Canadians stand on guard forpeace in the Middle East, in Cyprus, Sudan, and the Congo.Just two weeks ago, NATO countries showed their esteem for your military by electing GeneralRay Henault as Chairman of NATO's Military Committee. This admiration for your armed forcesgoes way back, and for good reason. It was said during World War I, the Canadians neverbudge. America respects the skill and honor and the sacrifice of Canadians' armed -- Canada'sarmed forces.Our nations play independent roles in the world, yet our purposes are complementary. Wehave important work ahead. A new term in office is an important opportunity to reach out toour friends. I hope to foster a wide international consensus among three great goals. The firstgreat commitment is to defend our security and spread freedom by building effectivemultinational and multilateral institutions and supporting effective multilateral action.The tasks of the 21st century, from fighting proliferation to fighting the scourge of HIV/AIDS,to fighting poverty and hungry [sic] cannot be accomplished by a single nation alone. TheUnited States and Canada participate together in more multilateral institutions than perhapsany two nations on Earth -- from NATO in Europe to the OAS in the Western Hemisphere toAPEC in the Pacific. Canada and the United States are working with a coalition of nationsthrough the Proliferation Security Initiative to stop and seize shipments of weapons of massdestruction, materials and delivery systems on land and at sea and in the air.America always prefers to act with allies at our side, and we're grateful to Canada for workingclosely with us to confront the challenges of Iran and North Korea. Multilateral organizationscan do great good in the world.Yet, the success of multilateralism is measured not merely by following a process, but byachieving results. The objective of the U.N. and other institutions must be collective security,not endless debate.For the sake of peace, when those bodies promise serious consequences, seriousconsequences must follow. America and Canada helped create the United Nations, andbecause we remain committed to that institution, we want it to be more than a League ofNations.My country is determined to work as far as possible within the framework of internationalorganizations, and we're hoping that other nations will work with us to make those institutionsmore relevant and more effective in meeting the unique threats of our time.Our second commitment is to fight global terrorism with every action and resource the taskrequires. Canada has taken a series of critical steps to guard against the danger of terrorism.You created the Department of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness. You've toughenedyour anti-terror laws. You're upgrading your intelligence. I want to thank the government forall those constructive and important decisions.Our two countries are working together every day -- every day -- to keep our people safe.That is the most solemn duty I have, and the most solemn duty the Prime Minister has. Fromthe smart border accord to the container security initiative to the joint command of NORAD,we are working together. I hope we'll also move forward on ballistic missile defensecooperation to protect the next generation of Canadians and Americans from the threats weknow will arise.The energetic defense of our nations is an important duty. Yet, defense alone is not asufficient strategy. On September the 11th, the people of North America learned that the twovast oceans and friendly neighbors cannot fully shield us from the dangers of the 21stcentury. There's only one way to deal with enemies who plot in secret and set out to murderthe innocent and the unsuspecting: We must take the fight to them. We must be relentlessand we must be steadfast in our duty to protect our people.Both of the countries have learned this lesson. In the early days of World War II, when theUnited States was still wrestling with isolationism, Canadian forces were already engaging theenemies of freedom from the Atlantic -- across the Atlantic. At the time, some Canadiansargued that Canada had not been attacked and had no interest in fighting a distant war. YourPrime Minister, McKenzie King, gave this answer: ""We cannot defend our country and save our homes and families by waiting for the enemy toattack us. To remain on the defensive is the surest way to bring the war to Canada. Of course,we should protect our coasts and strengthen our ports and cities against attack,"" but thePrime Minister went on to say, ""we must also go out and meet the enemy before he reachesour shores. We must defeat him before he attacks us, before our cities are laid to waste.""McKenzie King was correct then, and we must always remember the wisdom of his wordstoday.In the new era the threat is different, but our duties are the same. Our enemies have declaredtheir intentions -- and so have we. Peaceful nations must keep the peace by going after theterrorists and disrupting their plans and cutting off their funding. We must hold the sponsorsof terror equally responsible for terrorist acts. We must prevent outlaw regimes from gainingweapons of mass destruction and providing them to terrorists. We must stay at these effortswith patience and resolve, until we prevail.Our third great commitment is to enhance our own security by promoting freedom and hopeand democracy in the broader Middle East. The United States and Canada and all free nationsneed to look ahead. If, 20 years from now, the Middle East is dominated by dictators andmullahs who build weapons of mass destruction and harbor terrorists, our children and ourgrandchildren will live in a nightmare world of danger. That must not happen.By taking the side of reformers and democrats in the Middle East, we will gain allies in the waron terror, and isolate the ideology of murder and help to defeat the despair and hopelessnessthat feeds terror. The world will become a much safer place as democracy advances.For decades of tyranny and neglect in the broader Middle East, progress toward freedom willnot come easily. I know that. Yet, it is cultural condescension to claim that some peoples orsome cultures or some religions are destined to despotism and unsuited for self-government.Today in the Middle East, the doubters and pessimists are being proven wrong. We're seeingmovement toward elections, and greater rights for women, and open discussion of peacefulreform. I believe that people across the Middle East are weary of poverty and oppression andplead in silence for their liberty. I believe this is an historic moment in the broader MiddleEast, and we must seize this moment by standing with everyone who stands for liberty.We're standing with the people of Afghanistan, a nation that has gone from a safe haven forterrorists to a steadfast ally in the war on terror in three-and-a-half short years. Canadadeployed more than 7,000 troops and much of your navy in support of Operation EnduringFreedom. This year, your country has led the International Security Assistance Force in Kabul.The coalition we share is doing honorable work; yet democracy is taking hold in that countrybecause the Afghan people, like people everywhere, want to live in freedom. They registeredby the millions to vote in October. They stood in long lines on election day. An Afghan widowbrought all four of her daughters to vote alongside her. She said, ""When you see women herelined up to vote, this is something profound. I never dreamed this day would come."" But thatwoman's dream finally arrived, as it will one day across the Middle East. These areunprecedented, historic events that many said would never come. And Canadians can beproud of the part you have played in the advance of human liberty.We must also stand with the brave people of Iraq who are preparing for elections on Januarythe 30th. Sometimes, even the closest of friends disagree. And two years ago, we disagreedabout the best course of action in Iraq. Yet, as your Prime Minister made clear in Washingtonearlier this year, there is no disagreement at all with what has to be done in going forward.We must help the Iraqi people secure their country and build a free and democratic society.The Canadian government has pledged more than 200 million dollars in humanitarian aid andreconstruction assistance, and agreed to relieve more than 450 million dollars in Iraqi debt.That help is greatly appreciated.There's more work to be done together. Both Canada and the United States, and all freenations, have a vital interest in the success of a free Iraq. The terrorists have made Iraq thecentral front in the war on terror because they know what is at stake. When a free anddemocratic society is established in Iraq, in the heart of the Middle East, it will be a decisiveblow to their aspirations to dominate the region and its people. A free Iraq will be a standingrebuke to radicalism, and a model to reformers from Damascus to Tehran.In Fallujah and elsewhere, our coalition and Iraqi forces are on the offensive and we aredelivering a message: Freedom, not oppression, is the future of Iraq. Freedom is a preciousright for every individual, regardless of the color of their skin or the religion they may hold. Along night of terror and tyranny in that region is ending, and a new day of freedom and hopeand self-government is on the way.And we will stand with the Palestinian and Israeli peoples and help end the destructive conflictbetween them. Prime Minister Martin has expressed the desire of his government to take abroader role in the quest for peace and democracy, and America welcomes your involvement.It's a time of change and a time of hope in that region.We seek justice and dignity, and a viable independent and democratic state for the Palestinianpeople. We seek security and peace for the state of Israel, a state that Canada, like America,first recognized in 1948. These are worthy goals in themselves, and by reaching them, we willalso remove an excuse for hatred and violence in the broader Middle East.Achieving peace in the Holy Land is not just a matter of pressuring one side or the other onthe shape of a border or the site of a settlement. This approach has been tried before, withoutsuccess. As we negotiate the details of peace, we must look to the heart of the matter, whichis the need for a Palestinian democracy. The Palestinian people deserve a peacefulgovernment that truly serves their interests, and the Israeli people need a true partner inpeace.Our destination is clear: two states, Israel and Palestine, living side-by-side in peace andsecurity. And that destination can be reached by only one path, the path of democracy andreform and the rule of law. If all parties will apply effort, if all nations who are concernedabout this issue will apply goodwill, this conflict can end and peace can be achieved. And thetime for that effort and the time for that goodwill is now.The United States and Canada face common threats in our world, and we share common goalsthat can transform our world. We're bound by history and geography and trade, and by ourdeepest convictions. With so much in common and so much at stake, we cannot be divided. Irealize, and many Americans realize, that it's not always easy to sleep next to the elephant.Sometimes, our laws and our actions affect Canada every bit as much as they affect us, andwe need to remember that. And when frustrations are vented, we must not take it personally.As a member of Canada's Parliament said in the 1960s, ""The United States is our friend,whether we like it or not."" When all is said and done, we are friends -- and we like it.Three years ago, when the American planes were diverted away from home, passengers knewthey were safe and welcome the moment they saw the Maple Leaf flag. One of them later saidof the Canadians he met, ""They taught me the meaning of the word, 'friend.'"" For generations,the nation of Canada has defined the word, ""friend,"" and my country is grateful.God has blessed America in many ways. God has blessed us 'cause we have neighbors likeyou. And today, I ask that God continues to bless the people of Canada.Thank you.",bush
"On this day, prescribed by law and marked by ceremony, we celebrate the durable wisdom ofour Constitution, and recall the deep commitments that unite our country. I am grateful forthe honor of this hour, mindful of the consequential times in which we live, and determined tofulfill the oath that I have sworn and you have witnessed.At this second gathering, our duties are defined not by the words I use, but by the history wehave seen together. For a half century, America defended our own freedom by standing watchon distant borders. After the shipwreck of communism came years of relative quiet, years ofrepose, years of sabbatical - and then there came a day of fire.We have seen our vulnerability - and we have seen its deepest source. For as long as wholeregions of the world simmer in resentment and tyranny - prone to ideologies that feed hatredand excuse murder - violence will gather, and multiply in destructive power, and cross themost defended borders, and raise a mortal threat. There is only one force of history that canbreak the reign of hatred and resentment, and expose the pretensions of tyrants, and rewardthe hopes of the decent and tolerant, and that is the force of human freedom.We are led, by events and common sense, to one conclusion: The survival of liberty in ourland increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands. The best hope for peace inour world is the expansion of freedom in all the world.America's vital interests and our deepest beliefs are now one. From the day of our Founding,we have proclaimed that every man and woman on this earth has rights, and dignity, andmatchless value, because they bear the image of the Maker of Heaven and earth. Across thegenerations we have proclaimed the imperative of self-government, because no one is fit tobe a master, and no one deserves to be a slave. Advancing these ideals is the mission thatcreated our Nation. It is the honorable achievement of our fathers. Now it is the urgentrequirement of our nation's security, and the calling of our time.So it is the policy of the United States to seek and support the growth of democraticmovements and institutions in every nation and culture, with the ultimate goal of endingtyranny in our world.This is not primarily the task of arms, though we will defend ourselves and our friends byforce of arms when necessary. Freedom, by its nature, must be chosen, and defended bycitizens, and sustained by the rule of law and the protection of minorities. And when the soulof a nation finally speaks, the institutions that arise may reflect customs and traditions verydifferent from our own. America will not impose our own style of government on the unwilling.Our goal instead is to help others find their own voice, attain their own freedom, and maketheir own way.The great objective of ending tyranny is the concentrated work of generations. The difficultyof the task is no excuse for avoiding it. America's influence is not unlimited, but fortunately forthe oppressed, America's influence is considerable, and we will use it confidently in freedom'scause.My most solemn duty is to protect this nation and its people against further attacks andemerging threats. Some have unwisely chosen to test America's resolve, and have found itfirm.We will persistently clarify the choice before every ruler and every nation: The moral choicebetween oppression, which is always wrong, and freedom, which is eternally right. Americawill not pretend that jailed dissidents prefer their chains, or that women welcome humiliationand servitude, or that any human being aspires to live at the mercy of bullies.We will encourage reform in other governments by making clear that success in our relationswill require the decent treatment of their own people. America's belief in human dignity willguide our policies, yet rights must be more than the grudging concessions of dictators; theyare secured by free dissent and the participation of the governed. In the long run, there is nojustice without freedom, and there can be no human rights without human liberty.Some, I know, have questioned the global appeal of liberty - though this time in history, fourdecades defined by the swiftest advance of freedom ever seen, is an odd time for doubt.Americans, of all people, should never be surprised by the power of our ideals. Eventually, thecall of freedom comes to every mind and every soul. We do not accept the existence ofpermanent tyranny because we do not accept the possibility of permanent slavery. Liberty willcome to those who love it.Today, America speaks anew to the peoples of the world:All who live in tyranny and hopelessness can know: the United States will not ignore youroppression, or excuse your oppressors. When you stand for your liberty, we will stand withyou.Democratic reformers facing repression, prison, or exile can know: America sees you for whoyou are: the future leaders of your free country.The rulers of outlaw regimes can know that we still believe as Abraham Lincoln did: ""Thosewho deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves; and, under the rule of a just God,cannot long retain it.""The leaders of governments with long habits of control need to know: To serve your peopleyou must learn to trust them. Start on this journey of progress and justice, and America willwalk at your side.And all the allies of the United States can know: we honor your friendship, we rely on yourcounsel, and we depend on your help. Division among free nations is a primary goal offreedom's enemies. The concerted effort of free nations to promote democracy is a prelude toour enemies' defeat.Today, I also speak anew to my fellow citizens:From all of you, I have asked patience in the hard task of securing America, which you havegranted in good measure. Our country has accepted obligations that are difficult to fulfill, andwould be dishonorable to abandon. Yet because we have acted in the great liberating traditionof this nation, tens of millions have achieved their freedom. And as hope kindles hope,millions more will find it. By our efforts, we have lit a fire as well - a fire in the minds of men.It warms those who feel its power, it burns those who fight its progress, and one day thisuntamed fire of freedom will reach the darkest corners of our world.A few Americans have accepted the hardest duties in this cause - in the quiet work ofintelligence and diplomacy ... the idealistic work of helping raise up free governments ... thedangerous and necessary work of fighting our enemies. Some have shown their devotion toour country in deaths that honored their whole lives - and we will always honor their namesand their sacrifice.All Americans have witnessed this idealism, and some for the first time. I ask our youngestcitizens to believe the evidence of your eyes. You have seen duty and allegiance in thedetermined faces of our soldiers. You have seen that life is fragile, and evil is real, andcourage triumphs. Make the choice to serve in a cause larger than your wants, larger thanyourself - and in your days you will add not just to the wealth of our country, but to itscharacter.America has need of idealism and courage, because we have essential work at home - theunfinished work of American freedom. In a world moving toward liberty, we are determined toshow the meaning and promise of liberty.In America's ideal of freedom, citizens find the dignity and security of economic independence,instead of laboring on the edge of subsistence. This is the broader definition of liberty thatmotivated the Homestead Act, the Social Security Act, and the G.I. Bill of Rights. And now wewill extend this vision by reforming great institutions to serve the needs of our time. To giveevery American a stake in the promise and future of our country, we will bring the higheststandards to our schools, and build an ownership society. We will widen the ownership ofhomes and businesses, retirement savings and health insurance - preparing our people for thechallenges of life in a free society. By making every citizen an agent of his or her own destiny,we will give our fellow Americans greater freedom from want and fear, and make our societymore prosperous and just and equal.In America's ideal of freedom, the public interest depends on private character - on integrity,and tolerance toward others, and the rule of conscience in our own lives. Self-governmentrelies, in the end, on the governing of the self. That edifice of character is built in families,supported by communities with standards, and sustained in our national life by the truths ofSinai, the Sermon on the Mount, the words of the Koran, and the varied faiths of our people.Americans move forward in every generation by reaffirming all that is good and true thatcame before - ideals of justice and conduct that are the same yesterday, today, and forever.In America's ideal of freedom, the exercise of rights is ennobled by service, and mercy, and aheart for the weak. Liberty for all does not mean independence from one another. Our nationrelies on men and women who look after a neighbor and surround the lost with love.Americans, at our best, value the life we see in one another, and must always remember thateven the unwanted have worth. And our country must abandon all the habits of racism,because we cannot carry the message of freedom and the baggage of bigotry at the sametime.From the perspective of a single day, including this day of dedication, the issues and questionsbefore our country are many. From the viewpoint of centuries, the questions that come to usare narrowed and few. Did our generation advance the cause of freedom? And did ourcharacter bring credit to that cause?These questions that judge us also unite us, because Americans of every party andbackground, Americans by choice and by birth, are bound to one another in the cause offreedom. We have known divisions, which must be healed to move forward in great purposes- and I will strive in good faith to heal them. Yet those divisions do not define America. We feltthe unity and fellowship of our nation when freedom came under attack, and our responsecame like a single hand over a single heart. And we can feel that same unity and pridewhenever America acts for good, and the victims of disaster are given hope, and the unjustencounter justice, and the captives are set free.We go forward with complete confidence in the eventual triumph of freedom. Not becausehistory runs on the wheels of inevitability; it is human choices that move events. Not becausewe consider ourselves a chosen nation; God moves and chooses as He wills. We haveconfidence because freedom is the permanent hope of mankind, the hunger in dark places,the longing of the soul. When our Founders declared a new order of the ages; when soldiersdied in wave upon wave for a union based on liberty; when citizens marched in peacefuloutrage under the banner ""Freedom Now"" - they were acting on an ancient hope that is meantto be fulfilled. History has an ebb and flow of justice, but history also has a visible direction,set by liberty and the Author of Liberty.When the Declaration of Independence was first read in public and the Liberty Bell wassounded in celebration, a witness said, ""It rang as if it meant something."" In our time itmeans something still. America, in this young century, proclaims liberty throughout all theworld, and to all the inhabitants thereof. Renewed in our strength - tested, but not weary - weare ready for the greatest achievements in the history of freedom.May God bless you, and may He watch over the United States of America.",bush
"Well, thank you all very much for that warm welcome. Laura and I are honored to be here thismorning. I did a pretty good job when it came to picking my wife, by the way. She's going tobe a fabulous First Lady.Mr. Vice President, it's good to see you; of course, your wife, Lynn. And I want to thank themembers of my Cabinet who are here. I appreciate you, Senator Frist, for your commitmentand strong comments. And, Zach, thanks for your introduction. And thank you both fororganizing this important event. I want to thank the members of the House and the Senate who are here. I appreciate thenumber of foreign dignitaries who are here. It just goes to show that faith crosses everyborder, and touches every heart in every nation.Every President since the first one I can remember, Dwight Eisenhower, has taken part in thisgreat tradition. It's a privilege for me to speak where they have spoken, and to pray wherethey have prayed. All Presidents of the United States have come to the National PrayerBreakfast, regardless of their religious views. No matter what our background, in prayer weshare something universal -- a desire to speak and listen to our Maker, and to know His planfor our lives. America's Constitution forbids a religious test for office, and that's the way it should be. AnAmerican President serves people of every faith, and serves some of no faith at all. Yet I havefound my faith helps me in the service to people. Faith teaches humility. As Laura would say, I""could use a dose occasionally."" A recognition that we are small in God's universe, yetprecious in His sight. It has sustained me in moments of success, and in moments ofdisappointment. Without it I'd be a different person, and without it I doubt I'd be here today.There are many experiences of faith in this room. But most of us share a belief that we areloved, and called to love; that our choices matter, now and forever; that there are purposesdeeper than ambition and hopes greater than success. These beliefs shape our lives and helpsustain the life of our nation. Men and women can be good without faith, but faith is a force ofgoodness. Men and women can be compassionate without faith, but faith often inspirescompassion. Human beings can love without faith, but faith is a great teacher of love.Our country, from its beginnings has recognized the contribution of faith. We do not imposeany religion; we welcome all religions. We do not prescribe any prayer; we welcome allprayer[s]. This is the tradition of our nation, and it will be the standard of my Administration. We will respect every creed. We will honor the diversity of our country and the deepconvictions of our people.There's a good reason why many in our nation embrace the faith tradition. Throughout ourhistory people of faith have often been our nation's voice of conscience. The foes of slaverycould appeal to the standard that all are created equal in the sight of our Lord. The civil rightsmovement had the same conviction on its side -- that men and women bearing God's imageshould not be exploited and set aside, and treated as insignificant. The same impulse over theyears has reformed prisons and mental institutions, hospitals, hospices, and homelessshelters.The Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. said this: ""The church must be reminded that it is notthe master or the servant of the state, but rather the conscience of the state."" As in his case,that sometimes means defying the times, challenging old ways and old assumptions. Thisinfluence has made our nation more just and generous and decent. And our nation has needof that today. Faith remains an important -- remains important to the compassion of our nation. Millions ofAmericans serve their neighbor because they love their God. Their lives are characterized bykindness and patience, and service to others. They do for others what no government reallycan ever do -- no government program can really ever do: They provide love for anotherhuman being. They provide hope even when hope comes hard. In my second week in office we have set out to promote the work of community and faith-based charities. We want to encourage the inspired, to help the helper. Government cannot bereplaced by charities, but it can welcome them as partners instead of resenting them as rivals.My Administration will put the federal government squarely on the side of America's armies ofcompassion. Our plan will not favor religious institutions over non-religious institutions. AsPresident, I'm interested in what is constitutional, and I'm interested in what works.  The daysof discriminating against religious institutions, simply because they are religious, must cometo an end.Faith is also important to the civility of our country. It teaches us not merely to tolerate oneanother, but to respect one another -- to show a regard for different views and the courtesy tolisten. This is essential to democracy. It is also the proper way to treat human beings createdin the divine image. We will have our disagreements. Civility does not require us to abandon deeply-held beliefs.Civility does not demand casual creeds and colorless convictions. Americans have alwaysbelieved that civility and firm resolve could live easily with one another. But civility does meanthat our public debate ought to be free from bitterness and anger and rancor and ill-will.  Wehave an obligation to make our case, not to demonize our opponents.  As the Book of Jamesreminds us, fresh water and salt water cannot flow from the same spring.I'm under no illusion that civility will triumph in this city all at once. Old habits die hard -- andsometimes they never die at all. But I can only pledge to you this; that I will do my very bestto promote civility, and ask for the same in return.These are some of the crucial contributions of faith to our nation: justice, and compassion,and a civil and generous society. I thank you all here for displaying these values, anddefending them, here in America and across the world. You strengthen the ties of friendshipand the ties of nation[s]. And I deeply appreciate your work. I believe in the power of prayer. It's been said: ""I would rather stand against the cannons ofthe wicked than against the prayers of the righteous."" The prayers of a friend are one of life'smost gracious gifts. My family and I are blessed by the prayers of countless Americans. Overthe last several months, Laura and I have been touched by the number of people who comeup and say, ""We pray for you."" Such comforting words. I hope Americans will continue to praythat everyone in my Administration finds wisdom, and always remembers the common good. When President Harry Truman took office in 1945, he said this: ""At this moment, I have in myheart a prayer. I ask only to be a good and faithful servant of my Lord and my people."" Thishas been the prayer of many Presidents, and it is mine today.God bless.",bush
"Thank you all.Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, members of Congress, fellow citizens:As a new Congress gathers, all of us in the elected branches of government share a greatprivilege: We've been placed in office by the votes of the people we serve. And tonight that isa privilege we share with newly elected leaders of Afghanistan, the Palestinian territories,Ukraine, and a free and sovereign Iraq.Two weeks ago, I stood on the steps of this Capitol and renewed the commitment of ournation to the guiding ideal of liberty for all. This evening I will set forth policies to advancethat ideal at home and around the world. Tonight, with a healthy, growing economy, with more Americans going back to work, with ournation an active force for good in the world, the state of our union is confident and strong.Our generation has been blessed by the expansion of opportunity, by advances in medicine,by the security purchased by our parents' sacrifice. Now, as we see a little gray in the mirror -- or a lot of gray -- and we watch our children moving into adulthood, we ask the question:What will be the state of their union? Members of Congress, the choices we make together will answer that question. Over the nextseveral months, on issue after issue, let us do what Americans have always done and build abetter world for our children and our grandchildren. First, we must be good stewards of this economy and renew the great institutions on whichmillions of our fellow citizens rely. America's economy is the fastest growing of any majorindustrialized nation. In the past four years, we've provided tax relief to every person whopays income taxes, overcome a recession, opened up new markets abroad, prosecutedcorporate criminals, raised homeownership to its highest level in history. And in the last yearalone, the United States has added 2.3 million new jobs. When action was needed, the Congress delivered, and the nation is grateful. Now we mustadd to these achievements. By making our economy more flexible, more innovative and morecompetitive, we will keep America the economic leader of the world. America's prosperity requires restraining the spending appetite of the federal government. Iwelcome the bipartisan enthusiasm for spending discipline. I will send you a budget that holdsthe growth of discretionary spending below inflation, makes tax relief permanent, and stayson track to cut the deficit in half by 2009. My budget substantially reduces or eliminates morethan 150 government programs that are not getting results, or duplicate current efforts, or donot fulfill essential priorities. The principle here is clear: Taxpayer dollars must be spent wiselyor not at all. To make our economy stronger and more dynamic, we must prepare a rising generation to fillthe jobs of the 21st century. Under the No Child Left Behind Act, standards are higher, testscores are on the rise, and we're closing the achievement gap for minority students. Now wemust demand better results from our high schools so every high school diploma is a ticket tosuccess. We will help additional -- an additional 200,000 workers to get training for a bettercareer by reforming our job-training system and strengthening America's community colleges.And we will make it easier for Americans to afford a college education by increasing the size ofPell Grants. To make our economy stronger and more competitive, America must reward, not punish, theefforts and dreams of entrepreneurs. Small business is the path of advancement, especiallyfor women and minorities. So we must free small businesses from needless regulation andprotect honest job creators from junk lawsuits.Justice is distorted and our economy is held back by irresponsible class actions and frivolousasbestos claims. And I urge Congress to pass legal reforms this year.To make our economy stronger and more productive, we must make health care moreaffordable and give families greater access to good coverage and more control over theirhealth decisions.I -- I ask Congress to move forward on a comprehensive health-care agenda with tax creditsto help low-income workers buy insurance; a community health center in every poor county;improved information technology to prevent medical error and needless costs; associationhealth plans for small businesses and their employees,  expanded health savings accounts,and medical liability reform that will reduce health-care costs and make sure patients have thedoctors and care they need.To keep our economy growing, we also need reliable supplies of affordable, environmentallyresponsible energy. Nearly four years ago, I submitted a comprehensive energy strategy thatencourages conservation, alternative sources, a modernized electricity grid and moreproduction here at home, including safe, clean nuclear energy. My Clear Skies legislation will cut power-plant pollution and improve the health of our citizens.And my budget provides strong funding for leading-edge technology, from hydrogen-fueledcars to clean coal to renewable sources such as ethanol. Four years of debate is enough. Iurge Congress to pass legislation that makes America more secure and less dependent onforeign energy.All these proposals are essential to expand this economy and add new jobs, but they are justthe beginning of our duty. To build the prosperity of future generations, we must updateinstitutions that were created to meet the needs of an earlier time. Year after year, Americansare burdened by an archaic, incoherent federal tax code. I've appointed a bipartisan panel toexamine the tax code from top to bottom. And when their recommendations are delivered,you and I will work together to give this nation a tax code that is pro-growth, easy tounderstand, and fair to all.America's immigration system is also outdated -- unsuited to the needs of our economy and tothe values of our country. We should not be content with laws that punish hardworking peoplewho want only to provide for their families, and deny businesses willing workers, and invitechaos at our border. It is time for an immigration policy that permits temporary guest workersto fill jobs Americans will not take, that rejects amnesty, that tells us who is entering andleaving our country, and that closes the border to drug dealers and terrorists.One of America's most important institutions -- a symbol of the trust between generations --is also in need of wise and effective reform. Social Security was a great moral success of the20th century, and we must honor its great purposes in this new century. The system,however, on its current path, is headed toward bankruptcy. And so we must join together tostrengthen and save Social Security. Today, more than 45 million Americans receive SocialSecurity benefits, and millions more are nearing retirement. And for them, the system issound and fiscally strong.I have a message for every American who is 55 or older: Do not let anyone mislead you. Foryou, the Social Security system will not change in any way.For younger workers, the Social Security system has serious problems that will grow worsewith time. Social Security was created decades ago, for a very different era. In those days,people did not live as long, benefits were much lower than they are today, and a half centuryago, about 16 workers paid into the system for each person drawing benefits.Our society has changed in ways the founders of Social Security could not have foreseen. Intoday's world, people are living longer and therefore drawing benefits longer. And thosebenefits are scheduled to rise dramatically over the next few decades. And instead of 16workers paying in for every beneficiary, right now it's only about three workers.And over the next few decades, that number will fall to just two workers per beneficiary. Witheach passing year, fewer workers are paying ever- higher benefits to an ever-larger numberof retirees.So here is the result: Thirteen years from now, in 2018, Social Security will be paying outmore than it takes in. And every year afterward will bring a new shortfall, bigger than the yearbefore. For example, in the year 2027, the government will somehow have to come up withan extra 200 billion dollars to keep the system afloat. And by 2033, the annual shortfall wouldbe more than 300 billion dollars. By the year 2042, the entire system would be exhausted andbankrupt. If steps are not taken to avert that outcome, the only solutions would bedramatically higher taxes, massive new borrowing, or sudden and severe cuts in SocialSecurity benefits or other government programs.I recognize that 2018 and 2042 may seem a long way off. But those dates aren't so distant,as any parent will tell you. If you have a 5-year-old, you're already concerned about howyou'll pay for college tuition 13 years down the road. If you've got children in their 20s, assome of us do, the idea of Social Security collapsing before they retire does not seem like asmall matter. And it should not be a small matter to the United States Congress.You and I share a responsibility. We must pass reforms that solve the financial problems ofSocial Security once and for all. Fixing Social Security permanently will require an open,candid review of the options. Some have suggested limiting benefits for wealthy retirees.Former Congressman Tim Penny has raised the possibility of indexing benefits to prices ratherthan wages. During the 1990s, my predecessor, President Clinton, spoke of increasing theretirement age. Former Senator John Breaux suggested discouraging early collection of SocialSecurity benefits. The late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan recommended changing the waybenefits are calculated. All these ideas are on the table. I know that none of these reforms would be easy. But we have to move ahead with courageand honesty, because our children's retirement security is more important than partisanpolitics.I will work with members of Congress to find the most effective combination of reforms. I willlisten to anyone who has a good idea to offer. We must, however, be guided by some basic principles: - We must make Social Security permanently sound, not leave that task for another day. - We must not jeopardize our economic strength by increasing payroll taxes. - We must ensure that lower-income Americans get the help they need to have dignity andpeace of mind in their retirement. - We must guarantee that there is no change for those now retired or nearing retirement. - And we must take care that any changes in the system are gradual, so younger workershave years to prepare and plan for their future.As we fix Social Security, we also have the responsibility to make the system a better deal foryounger workers. And the best way to reach that goal is through voluntary personalretirement accounts. Here is how the idea works: Right now, a set portion of the money you earn is taken out ofyour paycheck to pay for the Social Security benefits of today's retirees. If you're a youngerworker, I believe you should be able to set aside part of that money in your own retirementaccount, so you can build a nest egg for your own future.Here is why the personal accounts are a better deal: Your money will grow, over time, at agreater rate than anything the current system can deliver. And your account will providemoney for retirement over and above the check you will receive from Social Security. Inaddition, you'll be able to pass along the money that accumulates in your personal account, ifyou wish, to your children and -- or grandchildren. And best of all, the money in the account isyours, and the government can never take it away.The goal here is greater security in retirement, so we will set careful guidelines for personalaccounts: We'll make sure the money can only go into a conservative mix of bonds and stockfunds. We'll make sure that your earnings are not eaten up by hidden Wall Street fees. We'llmake sure there are good options to protect your investments from sudden market swings onthe eve of your retirement. We'll make sure a personal account cannot be emptied out all at once, but rather paid outover time, as an addition to traditional Social Security benefits. And we'll make sure this planis fiscally responsible by starting personal retirement accounts gradually and raising the yearlylimits on contributions over time, eventually permitting all workers to set aside 4 percentagepoints of their payroll taxes in their accounts. Personal retirement accounts should be familiarto federal employees, because you already have something similar, called the Thrift SavingsPlan, which lets workers deposit a portion of their paychecks into any of five different broadlybased investment funds.It's time to extend the same security and choice and ownership to young Americans.Our second great responsibility to our children and grandchildren is to honor and to pass alongthe values that sustain a free society. So many of my generation, after a long journey, havecome home to family and faith, and are determined to bring up responsible, moral children.Government is not the source of these values, but government should never undermine them. Because marriage is a sacred institution and the foundation of society, it should not beredefined by activist judges. For the good of families, children and society, I support aconstitutional amendment to protect the institution of marriage.Because a society is measured by how it treats the weak and vulnerable, we must strive tobuild a culture of life. Medical research can help us reach that goal, by developing treatmentsand cures that save lives and help people overcome disabilities. And I thank the Congress fordoubling the funding of the National Institutes of Health. To build a culture of life, we mustalso ensure that scientific advances always serve human dignity, not take advantage of somelives for the benefit of others.We should all be able to agree -- We should all be able to agree on some clear standards. Iwill work with Congress to ensure that human embryos are not created for experimentation orgrown for body parts and that human life is never bought or sold as a commodity. Americawill continue to lead the world in medical research that is ambitious, aggressive, and alwaysethical.Because courts must always deliver impartial justice, judges have a duty to faithfully interpretthe law, not legislate from the bench. As President, I have a constitutional responsibility tonominate men and women who understand the role of courts in our democracy and are well-qualified to serve on the bench, and I have done so.The Constitution also gives the Senate a responsibility: Every judicial nominee deserves anup-or-down vote. Because one of the deepest values of our country is compassion, we must never turn awayfrom any citizen who feels isolated from the opportunities of America. Our government willcontinue to support faith-based and community groups that bring hope to harsh places. Nowwe need to focus on giving young people, especially young men in our cities, better optionsthan apathy or gangs or jail.Tonight I propose a three-year initiative to help organizations keep young people out of gangsand show young men an ideal of manhood that respects women and rejects violence. Takingon gang life will be one part of a broader outreach to at-risk youth, which involves parentsand pastors, coaches and community leaders, in programs ranging from literacy to sports.And I am proud that the leader of this nationwide effort will be our First Lady, Laura Bush. Because HIV/AIDS brings suffering and fear into so many lives, I ask you to reauthorize theRyan White Act to encourage prevention and provide care and treatment to the victims of thatdisease. And as we update this important law, we must focus our efforts on fellow citizenswith the highest rates of new cases: African-American men and women. Because one of the main sources of our national unity is our belief in equal justice, we need tomake sure Americans of all races and backgrounds have confidence in the system thatprovides justice. In America we must make doubly sure no person is held to account for acrime he or she did not commit.So we are dramatically expanding the use of DNA evidence to prevent wrongful conviction.Soon I will send to Congress a proposal to fund special training for defense counsel in capitalcases, because people on trial for their lives must have competent lawyers by their side.Our third responsibility to future generations is to leave them an America that is safe fromdanger and protected by peace. We will pass along to our children all the freedoms we enjoy.And chief among them is freedom from fear. In the three and a half years since Septemberthe 11th, 2001, we've taken unprecedented actions to protect Americans. We've created anew department of government to defend our homeland, focused the FBI on preventingterrorism, begun to reform our intelligence agencies, broken up terror cells across thecountry, expanded research on defenses against biological and chemical attack, improvedborder security, and trained more than a half million first responders. Police and firefighters,air marshals, researchers and so many others are working every day to make our homelandsafer, and we thank them all.Our nation, working with allies and friends, has also confronted the enemy abroad withmeasures that are determined, successful, and continuing. The Al Qaida terror network thatattacked our country still has leaders, but many of its top commanders have been removed.There are still governments that sponsor and harbor terrorists, but their number has declined.There are still regimes seeking weapons of mass destruction, but no longer without attentionand without consequence. Our country is still the target of terrorists who want to kill manyand intimidate us all. And we will stay on the offensive against them until the fight is won.Pursuing our enemies is a vital commitment of the war on terror. And I thank the Congress forproviding our service men and women with the resources they have needed. During this timeof war, we must continue to support our military and give them the tools for victory.Other nations around the globe have stood with us. In Afghanistan, an international force ishelping provide security. In Iraq, 28 countries have troops on the ground. The United Nationsand the European Union provided technical assistance for the elections. And NATO is leading amission to help train Iraqi officers.We're cooperating with 60 governments in the Proliferation Security Initiative to detect andstop the transit of dangerous materials. We're working closely with the governments in Asia toconvince North Korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions. Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and nine othercountries have captured or detained Al Qaida terrorists. In the next four years, my Administration will continue to build the coalitions that will defeatthe dangers of our time. In the long term, the peace we seek will only be achieved byeliminating the conditions that feed radicalism and ideologies of murder. If whole regions ofthe world remain in despair and grow in hatred, they will be the recruiting grounds for terror,and that terror will stalk America and other free nations for decades. The only force powerfulenough to stop the rise of tyranny and terror and replace hatred with hope is the force ofhuman freedom.Our enemies know this, and that is why the terrorist Zarqawi recently declared war on whathe called the ""evil principle"" of democracy. And we've declared our own intention: America willstand with the allies of freedom to support democratic movements in the Middle East andbeyond, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world.The United States has no right, no desire, and no intention to impose our form of governmenton anyone else. That is one -- That is one of the main differences between us and our enemies. They seek toimpose and expand an empire of oppression, in which a tiny group of brutal, self-appointedrulers control every aspect of every life. Our aim is to build and preserve a community of freeand independent nations, with governments that answer to their citizens and reflect their owncultures.And because democracies respect their own people and their neighbors, the advance offreedom will lead to peace. That advance has great momentum in our time, shown by womenvoting in Afghanistan, and Palestinians choosing a new direction, and the people of Ukraineasserting their democratic rights and electing a president. We are witnessing landmark eventsin the history of liberty. And in the coming years, we will add to that story. The beginnings ofreform and democracy in the Palestinian territories are now showing the power of freedom tobreak old patterns of violence and failure.Tomorrow morning, Secretary of State Rice departs on a trip that will take her to Israel andthe West Bank for meetings with Prime Minister Sharon and President Abbas. She will discusswith them how we and our friends can help the Palestinian people end terror and build theinstitutions of a peaceful, independent, democratic state. To promote this democracy, I willask Congress for 350 million dollars to support Palestinian political, economic and securityreforms. The goal of two democratic states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace iswithin reach, and America will help them achieve that goal.To promote peace and stability in the broader Middle East, the United States will work withour friends in the region to fight the common threat of terror, while we encourage a higherstandard of freedom. Hopeful reform is already taking hold in an arc from Morocco to Jordanto Bahrain. The government of Saudi Arabia can demonstrate its leadership in the region byexpanding the role of its people in determining their future. And the great and proud nation ofEgypt, which showed the way toward peace in the Middle East, can now show the way towarddemocracy in the Middle East.To promote peace in the broader Middle East, we must confront regimes that continue toharbor terrorists and pursue weapons of mass murder. Syria still allows its territory and partsof Lebanon to be used by terrorists who seek to destroy every chance of peace in theregion.You have passed, and we are applying, the Syrian Accountability Act. And we expectthe Syrian government to end all support for terror and open the door to freedom.Today, Iran remains the world's primary state sponsor of terror -- pursuing nuclear weaponswhile depriving its people of the freedom they seek and deserve. We are working withEuropean allies to make clear to the Iranian regime that it must give up its uraniumenrichment program and any plutonium reprocessing and end its support for terror. And tothe Iranian people, I say tonight: As you stand for your own liberty, America stands with you. Our generational commitment to the advance of freedom, especially in the Middle East, is nowbeing tested and honored in Iraq. That country is a vital front in the war on terror, which iswhy the terrorists have chosen to make a stand there. Our men and women in uniform arefighting terrorists in Iraq so we do not have to face them here at home.The victory of freedom in Iraq will strengthen a new ally in the war on terror, inspiredemocratic reformers from Damascus to Tehran, bring more hope and progress to a troubledregion, and thereby lift a terrible threat from the lives of our children and grandchildren. Wewill succeed because the Iraqi people value their own liberty, as they showed the world lastSunday. Across Iraq, often at great risk, millions of citizens went to the polls and elected 275men and women to represent them in a new transitional national assembly. A young womanin Baghdad told of waking to the sound of mortar fire on election day and wondering if itmight be too dangerous to vote. She said, ""Hearing those explosions, it occurred to me, theinsurgents are weak; they are afraid of democracy; they are losing. So I got my husband, andI got my parents, and we all came out and voted together."" Americans recognize that spirit of liberty, because we share it. In any nation, casting yourvote is an act of civic responsibility. For millions of Iraqis, it was also an act of personalcourage, and they have earned the respect of us all.One of Iraq's leading democracy and human rights advocates is Safia Taleb al-Suhail. Shesays of her country, ""We were occupied for 35 years by Saddam Hussein. That was the realoccupation. Thank you to the American people who paid the cost, but most of all to thesoldiers."" Eleven years ago, Safia's father was assassinated by Saddam's intelligence service.Three days ago in Baghdad, Safia was finally able to vote for the leaders of her country. Andwe are honored that she is with us tonight.The terrorists and insurgents are violently opposed to democracy and will continue to attackit. Yet the terrorists' most powerful myth is being destroyed. The whole world is seeing thatthe car bombers and assassins are not only fighting coalition forces, they are trying to destroythe hopes of Iraqis, expressed in free elections. And the whole world now knows that a smallgroup of extremists will not overturn the will of the Iraqi people.We will succeed in Iraq because Iraqis are determined to fight for their own freedom and towrite their own history. As Prime Minister Allawi said in his speech to Congress lastSeptember, ""Ordinary Iraqis are anxious to shoulder all the security burdens of our country asquickly as possible."" That is the natural desire of an independent nation, and it also is thestated mission of our coalition in Iraq.The new political situation in Iraq opens a new phase of our work in that country. At therecommendation of our commanders on the ground and in consultation with the Iraqigovernment, we will increasingly focus our efforts on helping prepare more capable Iraqisecurity forces -- forces with skilled officers and an effective command structure.As those forces become more self-reliant and take on greater security responsibilities, Americaand its coalition partners will increasingly be in a supporting role. In the end, Iraqis must beable to defend their own country, and we will help that proud, new nation secure its liberty.Recently an Iraqi interpreter said to a reporter, ""Tell America not to abandon us."" He and allIraqis can be certain: While our military strategy is adapting to circumstances, ourcommitment remains firm and unchanging. We are standing for the freedom of our Iraqifriends, and freedom in Iraq will make America safer for generations to come.We will not set an artificial timetable for leaving Iraq, because that would embolden theterrorists and make them believe they can wait us out. We are in Iraq to achieve a result: acountry that is democratic, representative of all its people, at peace with its neighbors andable to defend itself. And when that result is achieved, our men and women serving in Iraqwill return home with the honor they have earned.Right now, Americans in uniform are serving at posts across the world, often taking greatrisks on my orders. We have given them training and equipment. And they have given us anexample of idealism and character that makes every American proud.The volunteers of our military are unrelenting in battle, unwavering in loyalty, unmatched inhonor and decency, and every day they are making our nation more secure.Some of our service men and women have survived terrible injuries, and this grateful nationwill do everything we can to help them recover.And we have said farewell to some very good men and women who died for our freedom andwhose memory this nation will honor forever.One name we honor is Marine Corps Sergeant Byron Norwood of Pflugerville, Texas, who waskilled during the assault on Fallujah. His mom, Janet, sent me a letter and told me how muchByron loved being a Marine and how proud he was to be on the front line against terror.She wrote, ""When Byron was home the last time, I said that I wanted to protect him like I hadsince he was born. He just hugged me and said, 'You've done your job, Mom. Now it is myturn to protect you.'"" Ladies and gentlemen, with grateful hearts, we honor freedom'sdefenders and our military families, represented here this evening by Sergeant Norwood'smom and dad, Janet and Bill Norwood.In these four years, Americans have seen the unfolding of large events. We have known timesof sorrow and hours of uncertainty and days of victory. In all this history, even when we havedisagreed, we have seen threads of purpose that unite us.The attack on freedom in our world has reaffirmed our confidence in freedom's power tochange the world. We're all part of a great venture: to extend the promise of freedom in ourcountry, to renew the values that sustain our liberty and to spread the peace that freedombrings.As Franklin Roosevelt once reminded Americans, ""Each age is a dream that is dying or onethat is coming to birth.""And we live in the country where the biggest dreams are born.The abolition of slavery was only a dream -- until it was fulfilled.The liberation of Europe from fascism was only a dream -- until it was achieved.The fall of imperial communism was only a dream -- until, one day, it was accomplished.Our generation has dreams of its own, and we also go forward with confidence. The road ofprovidence is uneven and unpredictable, yet we know where it leads: It leads to freedom.Thank you. And may God bless America.",bush
"Thank you, all. Please be seated. It is great to be back to this fine university. Many greatmilitary leaders of the 20th century, from Dwight Eisenhower, to Colin Powell, studied on thiscampus. And today the National Defense University is training a new generation of leaderswho will serve and defend this nation in a new century. Americans are grateful for yourdevotion to duty, and so is your Commander-in-Chief.I am honored that two influential and important members of the United States Congress havejoined us. First, Senator Joe Lieberman, strong defender of freedom. Thank you for coming,Senator. And the Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Congressman DuncanHunter. Proud you're here, Dunc. Thanks for coming. In the midst of what we hope will be thefinal snow blizzard of 2005, I'm honored you two men slushed here to this event.I appreciate so very much Lieutenant General Michael Dunn and his wife, Pam, for greetingme and for serving our nation. I want to thank all the National Defense University students forbeing here. I appreciate the staff for joining us.I want to thank the members of the diplomatic corps who have come today. It is an honor tosee you all again. I want to thank my fellow Americans for caring about the subject of peace,and that's what I'm here to discuss.We meet at a time of great consequence for the security of our nation, a time when thedefense of freedom requires the advance of freedom, a time with echoes in our history.Twice in six decades, a sudden attack on the United States launched our country into a globalconflict, and began a period of serious reflection on America's place in the world. The bombingof Pearl Harbor taught America that unopposed tyranny, even on far-away continents, coulddraw our country into a struggle for our own survival. And our reflection on that lesson led usto help build peaceful democracies in the ruins of tyranny, to unite free nations in the NATOAlliance, and to establish a firm commitment to peace in the Pacific that continues to this day.The attacks of September the 11th, 2001 also revealed the outlines of a new world. In oneway, that assault was the culmination of decades of escalating violence -- from the killing ofU.S. Marines in Beirut, to the bombing at the World Trade Center, to the attacks on Americanembassies in Africa, to the attacks on the USS Cole. In another way, September the 11thprovided a warning of future dangers -- of terror networks aided by outlaw regimes, andideologies that incite the murder of the innocent, and biological and chemical and nuclearweapons that multiply destructive power.Like an earlier generation, America is answering new dangers with firm resolve. No matterhow long it takes, no matter how difficult the task, we will fight the enemy, and lift theshadow of fear, and lead free nations to victory. Like an earlier generation, America is pursuing a clear strategy with our allies to achievevictory. Our immediate strategy is to eliminate terrorist threats abroad, so we do not have toface them here at home. The theory here is straightforward: terrorists are less likely toendanger our security if they are worried about their own security. When terrorists spend theirdays struggling to avoid death or capture, they are less capable of arming and training tocommit new attacks. We will keep the terrorists on the run, until they have nowhere left tohide.In three and a half years, the United States and our allies have waged a campaign of globalscale -- from the mountains of Afghanistan, to the border regions of Pakistan, to the Horn ofAfrica, to the islands of the Philippines, to the plains of North Central Iraq. The al Qaeda terrornetwork that attacked our country still has leaders, but many of its top commanders havebeen removed. There are still governments that sponsor and harbor terrorists, but theirnumber has declined. There are still regimes seeking weapons of mass destruction -- but nolonger without attention and without consequence. Our country is still the target of terroristswho want to kill many, and intimidate us all. We will stay on the offensive against them, untilthe fight is won. Members of our military are undertaking difficult missions, in some of the most dangerous anddesolate parts of the world. These volunteers know the risks they face, and they know thecause they serve. As one Marine sergeant put it, ""I never want my children to experiencewhat we saw in New York, at the Pentagon, and in Pennsylvania."" He said, ""If we caneliminate whatever threat we can on foreign soil, I would rather do it there than have it come[home] to us."" In this vital cause, some of our men and women in uniform have fallen, somehave returned home with terrible injuries, and all who sacrifice will have the permanentgratitude of the United States of America. In this war on terror, America is not alone. Many governments have awakened to the dangerswe share and have begun to take serious action. Global terror requires a global response, andAmerica is more secure today because dozens of other countries have stepped up to the fight. We're more secure because Pakistani forces captured more than one hundred extremistsacross the country last year, including operatives who were plotting attacks against the UnitedStates. We're more secure because Britain arrested an al Qaeda operative who had provideddetailed casing reports on American targets to senior al Qaeda leaders. We're more securebecause German authorities arrested extremists who were planning attacks against U.S. andcoalition targets in Iraq. We're more secure because the Philippines' new Anti-Terrorism TaskForce has helped capture more than a dozen terrorist suspects -- including seven members ofal Qaeda and affiliated networks. We're more secure because Poland is leading a 15-nationmulti-national division in Iraq, and forces from 23 countries have given their lives in thestruggle against terrorists and insurgents in Afghanistan and Iraq.Our allies in the war on terror are making tough decisions, and they're taking risks, andthey're losing lives. These countries have proven themselves trusted friends and reliable allies.So I urge the Congress to pass the Solidarity Initiative I have proposed to stand by thecountries that are standing by us in the war on terror. Our strategy to keep the peace in the longer term is to help change the conditions that giverise to extremism and terror, especially in the broader Middle East. Parts of that region havebeen caught for generations in a cycle of tyranny and despair and radicalism. When adictatorship controls the political life of a country, responsible opposition cannot develop, anddissent is driven underground and toward the extreme. And to draw attention away from theirsocial and economic failures, dictators place blame on other countries and other races, andstir the hatred that leads to violence. This status quo of despotism and anger cannot beignored or appeased, kept in a box or bought off, because we have witnessed how theviolence in that region can reach easily across borders and oceans. The entire world has anurgent interest in the progress, and hope, and freedom in the broader Middle East. The advance of hope in the Middle East requires new thinking in the region. By now it shouldbe clear that authoritarian rule is not the wave of the future; it is the last gasp of a discreditedpast. It should be clear that free nations escape stagnation, and grow stronger with time,because they encourage the creativity and enterprise of their people. It should be clear thateconomic progress requires political modernization, including honest representativegovernment and the rule of law. And it should be clear that no society can advance with onlyhalf of its talent and energy -- and that demands the full participation of women. The advance of hope in the Middle East also requires new thinking in the capitals of greatdemocracies -- including Washington, D.C. By now it should be clear that decades of excusingand accommodating tyranny, in the pursuit of stability, have only led to injustice andinstability and tragedy. It should be clear that the advance of democracy leads to peace,because governments that respect the rights of their people also respect the rights of theirneighbors. It should be clear that the best antidote to radicalism and terror is the toleranceand hope kindled in free societies. And our duty is now clear: For the sake of our long-termsecurity, all free nations must stand with the forces of democracy and justice that have begunto transform the Middle East.Encouraging democracy in that region is a generational commitment. It's also a difficultcommitment, demanding patience and resolve -- when the headlines are good and when theheadlines aren't so good. Freedom has determined enemies, who show no mercy for theinnocent, and no respect for the rules of warfare. Many societies in the region struggle withpoverty and illiteracy, many rulers in the region have longstanding habits of control; manypeople in the region have deeply ingrained habits of fear. For all these reasons, the chances of democratic progress in the broader Middle East haveseemed frozen in place for decades. Yet at last, clearly and suddenly, the thaw has begun.The people of Afghanistan have embraced free government, after suffering under one of themost backward tyrannies on earth. The voters in Iraq defied threats of murder, and have settheir country on a path to full democracy. The people of the Palestinian Territories cast theirballots against violence and corruption of the past. And any who doubt the appeal of freedomin the Middle East can look to Lebanon, where the Lebanese people are demanding a free andindependent nation. In the words of one Lebanese observer, ""Democracy is knocking at thedoor of this country and, if it's successful in Lebanon, it is going to ring the doors of everyArab regime."" Across the Middle East, a critical mass of events is taking that region in a hopeful newdirection. Historic changes have many causes, yet these changes have one factor in common.A businessman in Beirut recently said, ""We have removed the mask of fear. We're not afraidanymore."" Pervasive fear is the foundation of every dictatorial regime -- the prop that holdsup all power not based on consent. And when the regime of fear is broken, and the peoplefind their courage and find their voice, democracy is their goal, and tyrants, themselves, havereason to fear. History is moving quickly, and leaders in the Middle East have important choices to make. Theworld community, including Russia and Germany and France and Saudi Arabia and the UnitedStates has presented the Syrian government with one of those choices -- to end its nearly 30-year occupation of Lebanon, or become even more isolated from the world. The Lebanesepeople have heard the speech by the Syrian president. They've seen these delaying tacticsand half-measures before. The time has come for Syria to fully implement Security CouncilResolution 1559. All Syrian military forces and intelligence personnel must withdraw beforethe Lebanese elections, for those elections to be free and fair.The elections in Lebanon must be fully and carefully monitored by international observers. TheLebanese people have the right to determine their future, free from domination by a foreignpower. The Lebanese people have the right to choose their own parliament this spring, free ofintimidation. And that new government will have the help of the international community inbuilding sound political, economic, and military institutions, so the great nation of Lebanoncan move forward in security and freedom. Today I have a message for the people of Lebanon: All the world is witnessing your greatmovement of conscience. Lebanon's future belongs in your hands, and by your courage,Lebanon's future will be in your hands. The American people are on your side. Millions acrossthe earth are on your side. The momentum of freedom is on your side, and freedom willprevail in Lebanon. America and other nations are also aware that the recent terrorist attack in Tel Aviv wasconducted by a radical Palestinian group headquartered in Damascus. Syria, as well as Iran,has a long history of supporting terrorist groups determined to sow division and chaos in theMiddle East, and there is every possibility they will try this strategy again. The time has comefor Syria and Iran to stop using murder as a tool of policy, and to end all support forterrorism.In spite of attacks by extremists, the world is seeing hopeful progress in the Israel-Palestinianconflict. There is only one outcome that will end the tyranny, danger, violence andhopelessness, and meet the aspirations of all people in the region: We seek two democraticstates, Israel and Palestine, living side-by-side in peace and security. And that goal is within reach, if all the parties meet their responsibilities and if terrorism isbrought to an end. Arab states must end incitement in their own media, cut off public andprivate funding for terrorism, stop their support for extremist education, and establish normalrelations with Israel. Israel must freeze settlement activity, help the Palestinians build athriving economy, and ensure that a new Palestinian state is truly viable, with contiguousterritory on the West Bank. Palestinian leaders must fight corruption, encourage freeenterprise, rest true authority with the people, and actively confront terrorist groups.The bombing in Tel Aviv is a reminder that the fight against terrorists is critical to the searchfor peace and for Palestinian statehood. In an interview last week, Palestinian President Abbasstrongly condemned the terrorist attack in Tel Aviv, declaring, ""Ending violence and securitychaos is first and foremost a Palestinian interest."" He went on to say, ""We cannot build thefoundations of a state without the rule of law and public order."" President Abbas is correct. And so the United States will help the Palestinian Authority buildthe security services that current peace and future statehood require: security forces whichare effective, responsive to civilian control, and dedicated to fighting terror and upholding therule of law. We will coordinate with the government of Israel, with neighbors such as Egyptand Jordan, and with other donors to ensure that Palestinians get the training and equipmentthey need. The United States is determined to help the parties remove obstacles to progressand move forward in practical ways, so we can seize this moment for peace in the Holy Land. In other parts of the Middle East, we're seeing small but welcome steps. Saudi Arabia's recentmunicipal elections were the beginning of reform that may allow greater participation in thefuture. Egypt has now -- has now the prospect of competitive, multi-party elections forPresident in September. Like all free elections, these require freedom of assembly, multiplecandidates, free access by those candidates to the media, and the right to form politicalparties. Each country in the Middle East will take a different path of reform. And every nationthat starts on that journey can know that America will walk at its side. Progress in the Middle East is threatened by weapons of mass destruction and theirproliferation. Today, Great Britain, France, and Germany are involved in a difficult negotiationwith Iran aimed at stopping its nuclear weapons program. We want our allies to succeed,because we share the view that Iran's acquisition of nuclear weapons would be destabilizingand threatening to all of Iran's neighbors. The Iranian regime should listen to the concerns ofthe world, and listen to the voice of the Iranian people, who long for their liberty and wanttheir country to be a respected member of the international community. We look forward tothe day when Iran joins in the hopeful changes taking place across the region. We lookforward to the day when the Iranian people are free.Iran and other nations have an example in Iraq. The recent elections have begun a process ofdebate and coalition building unique in Iraqi history, and inspiring to see. Iraq's leaders areforming a government that will oversee the next -- and critical -- stage in Iraq's politicaltransition: the writing of a permanent constitution. This process must take place withoutexternal influence. The shape of Iraq's democracy must be determined by the Iraqis,themselves. Iraq's democracy, in the long run, must also be defended by Iraqis, themselves. Our goal is tohelp Iraqi security forces move toward self-reliance, and they are making daily progress. Iraqiforces were the main providers of security at about 5,000 polling places in the Januaryelections. Our coalition is providing equipment and training to the new Iraqi military, yet theybring a spirit all of their own. Last month, when soldiers of the U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment were on combat patrol north ofBaghdad, one of their Humvees fell into a canal, and Iraqi troops came to their rescue --plunging into the water again and again, until the last American was recovered. The Armycolonel in charge of the unit said, ""When I saw those Iraqis in the water, fighting to save theirAmerican brothers, I saw a glimpse of the future of this country."" One of the Iraqi soldierscommented, ""These people have come a hundred -- 10,000 miles to help my country. They'veleft their families and their children. If we can give them something back, just a little, we canshow our thanks."" America is proud to defend freedom in Iraq, and proud to stand with thebrave Iraqis as they defend their own freedom. Three and a half years ago, the United States mourned our dead, gathered our resolve, andaccepted a mission. We made a decision to stop threats to the American people before theyarrive on our shores, and we have acted on that decision. We're also determined to seek andsupport the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture,with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world.This objective will not be achieved easily, or all at once, or primarily by force of arms. Weknow that freedom, by definition, must be chosen, and that the democratic institutions ofother nations will not look like our own. Yet we also know that our security increasinglydepends on the hope and progress of other nations now simmering in despair and resentment.And that hope and progress is found only in the advance of freedom.This advance is a consistent theme of American strategy -- from the Fourteen Points, to theFour Freedoms, to the Marshall Plan, to the Reagan Doctrine. Yet the success of this approachdoes not depend on grand strategy alone. We are confident that the desire for freedom, evenwhen repressed for generations, is present in every human heart.  And that desire can emergewith sudden power to change the course of history. Americans, of all people, should not be surprised by freedom's power. A nation founded on theuniversal claim of individual rights should not be surprised when other people claim thoserights. Those who place their hope in freedom may be attacked and challenged, but they willnot ultimately be disappointed, because freedom is the design of humanity and freedom is thedirection of history. In our time, America has been attacked. America has been challenged. Yet the uncertainty,and sorrow, and sacrifice of these years have not been in vain. Millions have gained theirliberty; and millions more have gained the hope of liberty that will not be denied. The trumpetof freedom has been sounded, and that trumpet never calls retreat.Before history is written in books, it is written in courage -- the courage of honorable soldiers;the courage of oppressed peoples; the courage of free nations in difficult tasks. Ourgeneration is fortunate to live in a time of courage. And we are proud to serve in freedom'scause. May God bless you all",bush
"Thank you all for the warm welcome. It wasn't all that long ago that I brought my family overto go to church Easter Sunday here at Fort Hood. I've been looking forward to coming backand giving you a proper Army greeting: Hoo-ah!  It's an honor to be with the courageous menand women of the ""Phantom Corps.""The soldiers and families of Fort Hood have contributed mightily to our efforts in the war onterror. Many of you have recently returned from Iraq.  Welcome home -- and thank you for ajob well-done.  Others are preparing to head out this fall --  some for a second tour of duty. Whether you're coming or going, you are making an enormous difference for the security ofour nation and for the peace of the world. I want to thank you for defending your fellowcitizens. I want to thank you for extending liberty to millions. And I want to thank you formaking America proud.I especially want to thank the military families who are here today. I want to thank you foryour sacrifices in the war on terror. It isn't easy being the one left behind when a loved onegoes to war. You have a wonderful community here at Fort Hood. I thank you for the supportyou have given to each other. By loving and supporting a soldier, you are also serving ournation. Americans are grateful for your sacrifice and your service -- and so is yourCommander-in-Chief.I want to thank Lieutenant General Tom Metz, and his wife, Pam. I want to thank CommandSergeant Major Joe Gainey, and his lovely wife. I want to thank all the officers and soldiers ofthis fantastic base.  I appreciate our fine Governor from the state of Texas, Governor RickPerry, for joining us today.  I want to thank Congressman John Carter and Congressman ChetEdwards for joining us today.  I'm looking forward to giving them a ride back to Washingtonon Air Force One.  I suspect they're looking forward to the ride back.I want to thank Major General Pete Chiarelli for being with us today, and his wife, Beth; MajorGeneral JD Thurman, and his wife, Dee; Command Sergeant Major Tom McMurtrie. And all thesoldiers, airmen, military families, veterans, friends of Fort Hood, and the Three Corps.This weekend we marked the two-year anniversary of the liberation of Baghdad.  Coalitionforces crossed more than 350 miles of desert to get there, pushing through dust storms anddeath squads. They reached the Iraqi capital in 21 days, and that achievement will be studiedfor generations as the fastest armored advance in military history.The coalition assault was rapid, and it wasn't easy. The enemy hid in schools and hospitals.They used civilians as human shields. Yet our troops persevered. We protected civilian liveswhile destroying the Republican Guard's Medina Division, pushing through the Karbala Gap,capturing Saddam International Airport, and, on April 9th, we liberated the Iraqi capital.For millions of Iraqis and Americans, it is a day they will never forget. The toppling of SaddamHussein's statue in Baghdad will be recorded, alongside the fall of the Berlin Wall, as one ofthe great moments in the history of liberty. And eight months later, soldiers of the IvyDivision brought the real Saddam Hussein to justice.  When Ironhorse soldiers left for Iraq,Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator sitting in a palace, and by the time you came home, hewas sitting in a prison cell.When it came time to drive the terrorists and insurgents from Fallujah, soldiers of the 1stCavalry Division spearheaded the assault. The ""First Team"" was ""First in Fallujah"" -- and whenthe dust settled, what you found there reminds us why we are at war: Blood-stained torturechambers used by terrorists to execute hostages; you found videos of beheadings and brutalterrorist attacks; you found over 600 improvised explosive devices, including an ice creamtruck that had been loaded with bomb-making materials for a terrorist attack.The men and women of the Phantom Corps know why we are in Iraq. As one First Teamsoldier, Lieutenant Mike Erwin, put it: ""If we can start to change the most powerful country inthe Middle East, the others will follow, and Americans 20 years down the road won't have todeal with a day like September the 11th, 2001.""The terrorists have made Iraq a central front in the war on terror. Because of your service,because of your sacrifice, we are defeating them there where they live, so we do not have toface them where we live.  Because of you, the people of Iraq no longer live in fear of beingexecuted and left in mass graves. Because of you, freedom is taking root in Iraq. Our successin Iraq will make America safer, for us and for future generations.In my liberation message to the Iraqi people, I made them a solemn promise: ""Thegovernment of Iraq, and the future of your country, will soon belong to you."" I went on tosay: ""We will help you build a peaceful and representative government that protects the rightsof all citizens. And then our military forces will leave.""From the beginning, our goal in Iraq has been to promote Iraqi independence -- by helpingthe Iraqi people establish a free country that can sustain itself, rule itself, and defend itself.And in the last two years, Iraqis have made enormous progress toward that goal. Iraqis havelaid the foundations of a free society, with hundreds of independent newspapers and dozens ofpolitical parties and associations, and schools that teach Iraqi children how to read and write,instead of the propaganda of Saddam Hussein. Iraqis have laid the foundation of a freeeconomy, with a new currency and independent central bank, new laws to encourage foreigninvestment, and thousands of small businesses established since liberation.The troops from Fort Hood have done their part. In Baghdad, soldiers of the 1st CavalryDivision launched Operation Adam Smith, and the new generation of Iraqi entrepreneurs youhelped nurture will create jobs and opportunities for millions of their fellow citizens. Iraqishave laid the foundation for a society built on the rule of law. Today, courts are functioningacross Iraq, and hundreds of independent Iraqi judges have been trained in Bahrain andJordan and Czech Republic and Britain and Italy.An Iraqi special tribunal has been established that will try senior leadership, including SaddamHussein.  He will get the trial that he did not afford his fellow citizens when he was in power.Slowly but surely, the land that gave civilization the first written code of law is now restoringthe rule of law, and setting the example for people across the Middle East.Iraqis have laid a solid foundation for democratic self-government. The world watched in aweas the Iraqi people defied the car bombers and assassins to cast their votes in the country'sfirst free and democratic election in decades. It took courage, the kind of courage displayedby a 29-year-old Iraqi policeman named Abdul Amir. On election day, Amir noticed asuspicious man walking toward the line of voters at a Baghdad polling station. With completedisregard for his own safety, he threw his arms around the man and dragged him into anearby intersection, where the man detonated the belt of explosives that was wrapped aroundhis body. Amir took the brunt of the blast, giving his own life to save scores of innocentcivilians. He is a hero of a free Iraq, and the world honors his valor and his sacrifice.Because of brave Iraqis like Abdul Amir, today the free nation of Iraq has elected atransitional assembly, a President and two Deputy Presidents, leaders who answer to thepeople, instead of the other way around.I've spoken with the new leaders of Iraq, President Talabani, as well as Speaker -- AssemblySpeaker al-Hassani. I congratulated them on their achievement. I told them I look forward toworking with the new government that will soon be established. I assured them that theUnited States will continue to stand with the Iraqi people as they take control of their destinyand assume the blessings of self-government.There's a lot of hard work ahead. The Iraqi people face brutal and determined enemies. ButIraqis are also determined, and they have the will to defeat the insurgency. The soldiers andpolice of a free Iraq learned on election day they can face down the insurgents, and theylearned they can prevail. The Iraqi people now have confidence that the soldiers and police ofa free Iraq have the courage and resolve to defend them. The Iraqi security forces are fightingbravely for the future of their country, and in the last six months alone, more than 800 havegiven their lives in the struggle.The soldiers of Fort Hood have seen their courage in action. Sergeant First Class Troy Hawkinsrecently put it, ""The Iraqis will stand and fight. I've seen guys with grenade fragments inthem, bleeding, pulling people off the street and getting kids out of the way. Then they'll fightthe enemy. They're determined to make this work."" And the United States is determined tohelp the Iraqis succeed.As Iraq's new government assumes increasing responsibility for the stability of their country,security operations are entering a new phase. Iraq security forces are becoming more self-reliant and taking on greater responsibilities.And that means that America and its coalition partners are increasingly playing more of asupporting role. Today, more than 150,000 Iraqi security forces have been trained andequipped, and for the first time, the Iraqi army, police and security forces now outnumberU.S. forces in Iraq.Like free people everywhere, Iraqis want to be defended and led by their own countrymen.We will help them achieve this objective so Iraqis can secure their own nation. And then ourtroops will come home with the honor they have earned.The Iraqi people know the sacrifices you are making. They're grateful to you. They aregrateful to your families. One Iraqi army colonel put it this way: ""These U.S. soldiers leavetheir wives and kids to come here and give us freedom. We have to thank them for doing thatfor us."" You are making possible the peace of Iraq, and you are making possible the securityof free nations. Yours is noble work, it's important work, and I thank you for assuming yourduty.As the Iraq democracy succeeds, that success is sending a message from Beirut to Tehranthat freedom can be the future of every nation. The establishment of a free Iraq at the heartof the Middle East will be a crushing defeat to the forces of tyranny and terror, and awatershed event in the global democratic revolution.In the last two years, you have accomplished much, yet your work isn't over. Freedom stillfaces dangerous adversaries. Terrorists still want to attack our people. But they're losing.These terrorists are losing the struggle because they're under constant pressure from ourArmed Forces, and they will remain under constant pressure from our Armed Forces.  Andthey are losing the struggle because they are on the wrong side of history. Across the broaderMiddle East, the tide of freedom is surging. The people of Afghanistan have embraced freegovernment, after suffering under one of the most backward tyrannies on Earth. The people ofthe Palestinian Territories cast their ballots against violence and corruption of the past. Thepeople of Lebanon are rising up to demand their freedom and independence. Saudi Arabia hasheld its first municipal elections in decades. Egypt is taking its first steps on the path todemocratic reform. A critical mass of events is taking that region in a hopeful new direction.And as freedom spreads in the Middle East and beyond, the American people will be safer andthe free world more secure.You have fought the battles in the war on terror, and you have served the cause of freedom.And you can be proud of all that you have achieved.This time of brave achievement is also a time of sacrifice. Many of our soldiers have returnedfrom war with grave wounds that they will carry with them the rest of their lives. And Americawill fulfill its duty by providing them the best medical care possible. Still others have giventheir lives in this struggle -- your friends, your comrades. We honor their memory. We liftthem up in prayer. Their sacrifice will always be remembered by a grateful nation.  We canlive as free people because men and women like you have stepped forward and havevolunteered to serve.I came here today to thank you in person for your courageous choice of service. You'remaking America proud. You're making America free. And you're making the world morepeaceful. I want to thank you for all you've done for our great nation. May God bless you andyour families. And may God continue to bless this great land of liberty, the United States ofAmerica.",bush
"Thank you, President Byker; members of the faculty; distinguished guests; parents, friends,family -- and, most importantly, the Class of 2005.Thanks for having me. I was excited to come back to Calvin, and I was just telling Laura theother night about what fun it would be to come to Calvin College. And I said, you know,""Laura, I love being around so many young folks. You know, it gives me a chance to re-livemy glory days in academia."" She said, ""George, that's not exactly how I would describe yourcollege experience."" She also said one other thing I think the graduates will appreciatehearing, good piece of advice. She said, the folks here are here to get their diploma, not tohear from an old guy go on too long. So with that sage advice, here goes. I bring a great message of hope and freedom to Calvin College Class of 2005: There's lifeafter Professor Vanden Bosch and English 101. Someday you will appreciate the grammar andverbal skills you learned here. And if any of you wonder how far a mastery of the Englishlanguage can take you, just look what it did for me.I thank the moms and dads here for your sacrifice and for your love. I want to thank thefaculty for your hard work and dedication. And, again, I congratulate the Class of 2005. Soon-- soon you will collect your degrees and say goodbyes to a school that has been your home,and you will take your rightful place in a country that offers you the greatest freedom andopportunity on Earth. I ask that you use what you've learned here to make your owncontributions to the story of American freedom. The immigrants who founded Calvin College came to America for the freedom to worship, andthey built this great school on the sturdy ground of liberty. They saw in the American""experiment"" the world's best hope for freedom -- and they weren't the only ones excitedabout what they saw. In 1835, a young civil servant and aristocrat from France, named Alexisde Tocqueville, would publish a book about America that still resonates today.The book is called ""Democracy in America,"" and in it this young Frenchman said that thesecret to America's success was our talent for bringing people together for the common good.De Tocqueville wrote that tyrants maintained their power by ""isolating"" their citizens -- andthat Americans guaranteed their freedom by their remarkable ability to band together withoutany direction from government. The America he described offered the world something it hadnever seen before: a working model of a thriving democracy where opportunity wasunbounded, where virtue was strong, and where citizens took responsibility for theirneighbors.Tocqueville's account is not just the observations of one man -- it is the story of our founding.It's not just a description of America at a point in time -- it is an agenda for our time. OurFounders rejected both a radical individualism that makes no room for others, and the drearycollectivism that crushes the individual. They gave us instead a society where individualfreedom is anchored in communities. And in this hopeful new century, we have a great goal:to renew this spirit of community and thereby renew the character and compassion of ourcountry.First, we must understand that the character of our citizens is essential to society. In a freeand compassionate society, the public good depends on private character. That character isformed and shaped in institutions like family, faith, and the many civil and -- social and civicorganizations, from the Boy Scouts to the Rotary Clubs.The future success of our nation depends on our ability to understand the difference betweenright and wrong and to have the strength of character to make the right choices. Governmentcannot create character, but it can and should respect and support the institutions that do.Second, we must understand the importance of keeping power close to the people. Localpeople know local problems, they know the names and faces of their neighbors. The heart andsoul of America is in our local communities; it is in the citizen school boards that determinehow our children are educated; it's in city councils and state legislators that reflect the uniqueneeds and priorities of the people they serve; it's in the volunteer groups that transformtowns and cities into caring communities and neighborhoods. In the years to come, I hopethat you'll consider joining these associations or serving in government -- because when youcome together to serve a cause greater than yourself, you will energize your communities andyou will help build a more just and compassionate America.Finally, we must understand that it is by becoming active in our communities that we movebeyond our narrow interests. In today's complex world, there are a lot of things that pull usapart. We need to support and encourage the institutions and pursuits that bring us together.And we learn how to come together by participating in our churches and temples and mosquesand synagogues; in civil rights associations; in our PTAs and Jaycees; in our gardening andbook clubs, interest groups and chambers of commerce; in our service groups -- from soupkitchens to homeless shelters.All these organizations promote the spirit of community and help us acquire the ""habits ofheart"" that are so vital to a free society. And because one of the deepest values of our countryis compassion, we must never turn away from any citizen who feels isolated from theopportunities of America. Our faith-based and community groups provide the armies ofcompassion that help people who wonder if the American Dream is meant for them. Thesearmies of compassion are the great engines of social change. They serve individual and localneeds, and they have been found at the front of every great movement in American history.The history of forming associations dedicated to serving others is as old as America, itself.From abolition societies and suffrage movements to immigrant aid groups and prison reformministries, America's social entrepreneurs have often been far ahead of our government inidentifying and meeting the needs of our fellow countrymen.Because they are closer to the people they serve, our faith-based and communityorganizations deliver better results than government. And they have a human touch: When aperson in need knocks on the door of a faith-based or community organization, he or she iswelcomed as a brother or a sister.No one understood this better than another 19th century visitor to America whose name iswell known to Calvin College: Abraham Kuyper. Kuyper was a Dutchman who would beelected his nation's prime minister, and he knew all about the importance of associationsbecause he founded so many of them -- including two newspapers, a political party, and auniversity. Kuyper contrasted the humanizing influence of independent social institutions withthe ""mechanical character of government."" And in a famous speech right here in GrandRapids, he urged Dutch immigrants to resist the temptation to retreat behind their own walls.He told them to go out into their adopted America and make a true difference as trueChristian citizens. Our government is encouraging all Americans to make a difference through our faith-basedand community initiative; we're mobilizing Americans to volunteer through the USA FreedomCorps. We'll do our part, but, ultimately, service is up to you. It is your choice to make. Asyour generation takes its place in the world, all of you must make this decision: Will you be aspectator or a citizen? To make a difference in this world, you must be involved. By serving ahigher calling here or abroad, you'll make your lives richer and build a more hopeful future forour world.At Calvin College, you take this call to service to heart. You serve as ""agents of renewal""across the Earth. You volunteer for Big Brothers/Big Sisters to mentor young people. You workat Bethany Christian Services here in Grand Rapids, one of the best-known adoption servicesin America. A former Calvin student and professor, Vern Ehlers, serves in the halls ofCongress. As the Class of 2005 goes out into the world, I ask you to embrace this tradition ofservice and help set an example for all Americans. As Americans we share an agenda thatcalls us to action -- a great responsibility to serve and love others, a responsibility that goesback to the greatest commandment.This isn't a Democrat idea. This isn't a Republican idea. This is an American idea. It hassustained our nation's liberty for more than 200 years. The Founders knew that too muchgovernment leads to oppression, but that too little government can leave us helpless andalone. So they built a free society with many roots in community. And to keep the tree ofliberty standing tall in the century before us, you must nourish those roots.Today, the Calvin Class of 2005 looks out on an America that continues to be defined by thepromise of our Declaration of Independence. We're [still] the nation our Founders imagined,where individual freedom and opportunity is unbounded, where community is vibrant, wherecompassion keeps us from resting until all our citizens take their place at the banquet offreedom and equality. And with your help, we'll all do our part to transform our great land oneperson and one community at a time. Thank you for having me and may God bless you, and may God continue to bless our country.",bush
"Good evening. I'm speaking to you from the city of New Orleans -- nearly empty, still partlyunder water, and waiting for life and hope to return. Eastward from Lake Pontchartrain, acrossthe Mississippi coast, to Alabama into Florida, millions of lives were changed in a day by acruel and wasteful storm. In the aftermath, we have seen fellow citizens left stunned and uprooted, searching for lovedones, and grieving for the dead, and looking for meaning in a tragedy that seems so blind andrandom. We've also witnessed the kind of desperation no citizen of this great and generousnation should ever have to know -- fellow Americans calling out for food and water, vulnerablepeople left at the mercy of criminals who had no mercy, and the bodies of the dead lyinguncovered and untended in the street. These days of sorrow and outrage have also been marked by acts of courage and kindnessthat make all Americans proud. Coast Guard and other personnel rescued tens of thousands ofpeople from flooded neighborhoods. Religious congregations and families have welcomedstrangers as brothers and sisters and neighbors.In the community of Chalmette, when two men tried to break into a home, the owner invitedthem to stay -- and took in 15 other people who had no place to go. At Tulane Hospital forChildren, doctors and nurses did not eat for days so patients could have food, and eventuallycarried the patients on their backs up eight flights of stairs to helicopters. Many first responders were victims themselves, wounded healers, with a sense of duty greaterthan their own suffering. When I met Steve Scott of the Biloxi Fire Department, he and hiscolleagues were conducting a house-to-house search for survivors. Steve told me this, ""I lostmy house and I lost my cars, but I still got my family, and I still got my spirit."" Across the Gulf Coast, among people who have lost much, and suffered much, and given tothe limit of their power, we are seeing that same spirit -- a core of strength that survives allhurt, a faith in God no storm can take away, and a powerful American determination to clearthe ruins and build better than before. Tonight so many victims of the hurricane and the flood are far from home and friends andfamiliar things. You need to know that our whole nation cares about you, and in the journeyahead you're not alone. To all who carry a burden of loss, I extend the deepest sympathy ofour country. To every person who has served and sacrificed in this emergency, I offer thegratitude of our country. And tonight I also, also offer this pledge of the American people:Throughout the area hit by the hurricane, we will do what it takes, we will stay as long as ittakes, to help citizens rebuild their communities and their lives. And all who question thefuture of the Crescent City need to know there is no way to imagine America without NewOrleans, and this great city will rise again. The work of rescue is largely finished; the work of recovery is moving forward. In nearly all ofMississippi, electric power has been restored. Trade is starting to return to the Port of NewOrleans, and agricultural shipments are moving down the Mississippi River. All major gasolinepipelines are now in operation, preventing the supply disruptions that many feared. Thebreaks in the levees have been closed, the pumps are running, and the water here in NewOrleans is receding by the hour. Environmental officials are on the ground, taking watersamples, identifying and dealing with hazardous debris, and working to get drinking water andwaste water treatment systems operating again. And some very sad duties are being carriedout by professionals who gather the dead, treat them with respect, and prepare them for theirrest. In the task of recovery and rebuilding, some of the hardest work is still ahead, and it willrequire the creative skill and generosity of a united country. Our first commitment is to meet the immediate needs of those who had to flee their homesand leave all their possessions behind. For these Americans, every night brings uncertainty,every day requires new courage, and in the months to come will bring more than their fairshare of struggles. The Department of Homeland Security is registering evacuees who are now in shelters andchurches, or private homes, whether in the Gulf region or far away. I have signed an orderproviding immediate assistance to people from the disaster area. As of today, more than500,000 evacuee families have gotten emergency help to pay for food, clothing, and otheressentials. Evacuees who have not yet  (registered? 5:38) registered should contact FEMA orthe Red Cross. We need to know who you are, because many of you will be eligible forbroader assistance in the future. Many families were separated during the evacuation, and weare working to help you reunite. Please call this number: 1-877-568-3317 -- that's 1-877-568-3317 -- and we will work to bring your family back together, and pay for your travel toreach them. In addition, we're taking steps to ensure that evacuees do not have to travel great distancesor navigate bureaucracies to get the benefits that are there for them. The Department ofHealth and Human Services has sent more than 1,500 health professionals, along with over50 tons of medical supplies -- including vaccines and antibiotics and medicines for people withchronic conditions such as diabetes. The Social Security Administration is delivering checks.The Department of Labor is helping displaced persons apply for temporary jobs andunemployment benefits. And the Postal Service is registering new addresses so that peoplecan get their mail. To carry out the first stages of the relief effort and begin rebuilding at once, I have asked for,and the Congress has provided, more than $60 billion dollars. This is an unprecedentedresponse to an unprecedented crisis, which demonstrates the compassion and resolve of ournation. Our second commitment is to help the citizens of the Gulf Coast to overcome this disaster, puttheir lives back together, and rebuild their communities. Along this coast, for mile after mile,the wind and water swept the land clean. In Mississippi, many thousands of houses weredamaged or destroyed. In New Orleans and surrounding parishes, more than a quarter-millionhouses are no longer safe to live in. Hundreds of thousands of people from across this regionwill need to find longer-term housing.Our goal is to get people out of the shelters by the middle of October. So we're providingdirect assistance to evacuees that allows them to rent apartments, and many already aremoving into places of their own. A number of states have taken in evacuees and shown themgreat compassion -- admitting children to school, and providing health care. So I will workwith the Congress to ensure that states are reimbursed for these extra expenses. In the disaster area, and in cities that have received huge numbers of displaced people, we'rebeginning to bring in mobile homes and trailers for temporary use. To relieve the burden onlocal health care facilities in the region, we're sending extra doctors and nurses to theseareas. We're also providing money that can be used to cover overtime pay for police and firedepartments while the cities and towns rebuild. Near New Orleans, Biloxi, and other cities, housing is urgently needed for police andfirefighters, other service providers, and the many workers who are going to rebuild thesecities. Right now, many are sleeping on ships we have brought to the Port of New Orleans --and more ships are on their way to the region. And we'll provide mobile homes, and supplythem with basic services, as close to construction areas as possible, so the rebuilding processcan go forward as quickly as possible. And the federal government will undertake a close partnership with the states of Louisianaand Mississippi, the city of New Orleans, and other Gulf Coast cities, so they can rebuild in asensible, well-planned way. Federal funds will cover the great majority of the costs ofrepairing public infrastructure in the disaster zone, from roads and bridges to schools andwater systems. Our goal is to get the work done quickly. And taxpayers expect this work to bedone honestly and wisely -- so we'll have a team of inspectors general reviewing allexpenditures. In the rebuilding process, there will be many important decisions and many details to resolve,yet we're moving forward according to some clear principles. The federal government will befully engaged in the mission, but Governor Barbour, Governor Blanco, Mayor Nagin, and otherstate and local leaders will have the primary role in planning for their own future. Clearly,communities will need to move decisively to change zoning laws and building codes, in orderto avoid a repeat of what we've seen. And in the work of rebuilding, as many jobs as possibleshould go to the men and women who live in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Our third commitment is this: When communities are rebuilt, they must be even better andstronger than before the storm.Within the Gulf region are some of the most beautiful and historic places in America. As all ofus saw on television, there's also some deep, persistent poverty in this region as well. Thatpoverty has roots in a history of racial discrimination, which cut off generations from theopportunity of America. We have a duty to confront this poverty with bold action. So let usrestore all that we have cherished from yesterday, and let us rise above the legacy ofinequality. When the streets are rebuilt, there should be many new businesses, includingminority-owned businesses, along those streets. When the houses are rebuilt, more familiesshould own, not rent, those houses. When the regional economy revives, local people shouldbe prepared for the jobs being created. Americans want the Gulf Coast not just to survive, but to thrive; not just to cope, but toovercome. We want evacuees to come home, for the best of reasons -- because they have areal chance at a better life in a place they love. When one resident of this city who lost his home was asked by a reporter if he would relocate,he said, ""Naw, I will rebuild -- but I will build higher."" That is our vision for the future, in thiscity and beyond. We'll not just rebuild, we'll build higher and better. To meet this goal, I willlisten to good ideas from Congress, and state and local officials, and the private sector. Ibelieve we should start with three initiatives that the Congress should pass. Tonight I propose the creation of a Gulf Opportunity Zone, encompassing the region of thedisaster in Louisiana and Mississippi and Alabama. Within this zone, we should provideimmediate incentives for job-creating investment, tax relief for small businesses, incentives tocompanies that create jobs, and loans and loan guarantees for small businesses, includingminority-owned enterprises, to get them up and running again. It is entrepreneurship thatcreates jobs and opportunity; it is entrepreneurship that helps break the cycle of poverty; andwe will take the side of entrepreneurs as they lead the economic revival of the Gulf region. I propose the creation of Worker Recovery Accounts to help those evacuees who need extrahelp finding work. Under this plan, the federal government would provide accounts of up to$5,000, which these evacuees could draw upon for job training and education to help themget a good job, and for child care expenses during their job search. And to help lower-income citizens in the hurricane region build new and better lives, I alsopropose that Congress pass an Urban Homesteading Act. Under this approach, we will identifyproperty in the region owned by the federal government, and provide building sites to low-income citizens free of charge, through a lottery. In return, they would pledge to build on thelot, with either a mortgage or help from a charitable organization like Habitat for Humanity.Home ownership is one of the great strengths of any community, and it must be a central partof our vision for the revival of this region. In the long run, the New Orleans area has a particular challenge, because much of the city liesbelow sea level. The people who call it home need to have reassurance that their lives will besafer in the years to come. Protecting a city that sits lower than the water around it is noteasy, but it can, and has been done. City and parish officials in New Orleans, and stateofficials in Louisiana will have a large part in the engineering decisions to come. And the ArmyCorps of Engineers will work at their side to make the flood protection system stronger than ithas ever been. The work that has begun in the Gulf Coast region will be one of the largest reconstructionefforts the world has ever seen. When that job is done, all Americans will have something tobe very proud of -- and all Americans are needed in this common effort. It is the armies ofcompassion -- charities and houses of worship, and idealistic men and women -- that give ourreconstruction effort its humanity. They offer to those who hurt a friendly face, an arm aroundthe shoulder, and the reassurance that in hard times, they can count on someone who cares.By land, by sea, and by air, good people wanting to make a difference deployed to the GulfCoast, and they've been working around the clock ever since. The cash needed to support the armies of compassion is great, and Americans have givengenerously. For example, the private fundraising effort led by former Presidents Bush andClinton has already received pledges of more than $100 million dollars. Some of that money isgoing to the Governors to be used for immediate needs within their states. A portion will alsobe sent to local houses of worship to help reimburse them for the expense of helping others.This evening the need is still urgent, and I ask the American people to continue donating tothe Salvation Army, the Red Cross, other good charities, and religious congregations in theregion. It's also essential for the many organizations of our country to reach out to your fellowcitizens in the Gulf area. So I've asked USA Freedom Corps to create an informationclearinghouse, available at usafreedomcorps.gov, so that families anywhere in the country canfind opportunities to help families in the region, or a school can support a school. And Ichallenge existing organizations -- churches, and Scout troops, or labor union locals to get intouch with their counterparts in Mississippi, Louisiana, or Alabama, and learn what they cando to help. In this great national enterprise, important work can be done by everyone, andeveryone should find their role and do their part.The government of this nation will do its part, as well. Our cities must have clear and up-to-date plans for responding to natural disasters, and disease outbreaks, or a terrorist attack, forevacuating large numbers of people in an emergency, and for providing the food and waterand security they would need. In a time of terror threats and weapons of mass destruction,the danger to our citizens reaches much wider than a fault line or a flood plain. I considerdetailed emergency planning to be a national security priority, and therefore, I've ordered theDepartment of Homeland Security to undertake an immediate review, in cooperation with localcounterparts, of emergency plans in every major city in America. I also want to know all the facts about the government response to Hurricane Katrina. Thestorm involved a massive flood, a major supply and security operation, and an evacuationorder affecting more than a million people. It was not a normal hurricane -- and the normaldisaster relief system was not equal to it. Many of the men and women of the Coast Guard,the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the United States military, the National Guard,Homeland Security, and state and local governments performed skillfully under the worstconditions. Yet the system, at every level of government, was not well-coordinated, and wasoverwhelmed in the first few days. It is now clear that a challenge on this scale requiresgreater federal authority and a broader role for the armed forces -- the institution of ourgovernment most capable of massive logistical operations on a moment's notice. Four years after the frightening experience of September the 11th, Americans have everyright to expect a more effective response in a time of emergency. When the federalgovernment fails to meet such an obligation, I, as President, am responsible for the problem,and for the solution. So I've ordered every Cabinet Secretary to participate in acomprehensive review of the government response to the hurricane. This government willlearn the lessons of Hurricane Katrina. We're going to review every action and makenecessary changes, so that we are better prepared for any challenge of nature, or act of evilmen, that could threaten our people. The United States Congress also has an important oversight function to perform. Congress ispreparing an investigation, and I will work with members of both parties to make sure thiseffort is thorough. In the life of this nation, we have often been reminded that nature is an awesome force, andthat all life is fragile. We're the heirs of men and women who lived through those first terriblewinters at Jamestown and Plymouth, who rebuilt Chicago after a great fire, and San Franciscoafter a great earthquake, who reclaimed the prairie from the Dust Bowl of the 1930s.Every time, the people of this land have come back from fire, flood, and storm to build anew -- and to build better than what we had before. Americans have never left our destiny to thewhims of nature -- and we will not start now. These trials have also reminded us that we are often stronger than we know -- with the helpof grace and one another. They remind us of a hope beyond all pain and death, a God whowelcomes the lost to a house not made with hands. And they remind us that we're tiedtogether in this life, in this nation -- and that the despair of any touches us all. I know that when you sit on the steps of a porch where a home once stood, or sleep on a cotin a crowded shelter, it is hard to imagine a bright future. But that future will come. Thestreets of Biloxi and Gulfport will again be filled with lovely homes and the sound of childrenplaying. The churches of Alabama will have their broken steeples mended and theircongregations whole. And here in New Orleans, the street cars will once again rumble downSt. Charles, and the passionate soul of a great city will return. In this place, there's a custom for the funerals of jazz musicians. The funeral processionparades slowly through the streets, followed by a band playing a mournful dirge as it movesto the cemetery. Once the casket has been laid in place, the band breaks into a joyful ""secondline"" -- symbolizing the triumph of the spirit over death. Tonight the Gulf Coast is still comingthrough the dirge -- yet we will live to see the second line. Thank you, and may God bless America.",bush
"Thanks for the warm welcome. It's good to be back at the Naval Academy. I'm pleased toprovide a convenient excuse for you to miss class. This is the first year that every class of midshipmen at this Academy arrived after the attacksof September the 11th, 2001. Each of you has volunteered to wear our nation's uniform in atime of war -- knowing all the risks and dangers that accompany military service. Our citizensare grateful for your devotion to duty -- and America is proud of the men and women of theUnited States Naval Academy. I thank Admiral Rempt for his invitation for me to come and give this speech. I appreciateAdmiral Mike Mullen. I'm traveling today with a man who's done a fine job as the Secretary ofDefense -- Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. Navy aviator, Don Rumsfeld. I'm proudthat the Governor of the great state of Maryland, Bob Ehrlich, and his wife, Kendel, is with us.Thanks for being here, Governor.I so appreciate that members of the United States Congress have joined us, starting with theChairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator John Warner of the state ofVirginia. Former Secretary of the United States Navy, I might add. Chairman of the HousePermanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Congressman Pete Hoekstra. From the state ofArizona, Congressman John Shadegg. And from the state of Indiana, Congressman MikePence. I'm honored you all came, thanks for being here. I appreciate the Mayor of the city of Annapolis, Mayor Ellen Moyer, joining us. I want to thankall the state and local officials. I want to thank the faculty members here. Thank you all forletting me come by. Six months ago, I came here to address the graduating class of 2005. I spoke to them aboutthe importance of their service in the first war of the 21st century -- the global war on terror.I told the class of 2005 that four years at this Academy had prepared them morally, mentallyand physically for the challenges ahead. And now they're meeting those challenges as officersin the United States Navy and Marine Corps. Some of your former classmates are training with Navy SEAL teams that will storm terroristsafe houses in lightning raids. Others are preparing to lead Marine rifle platoons that will huntthe enemy in the mountains of Afghanistan and the streets of Iraqi cities. Others are trainingas naval aviators who will fly combat missions over the skies of Afghanistan and Iraq andelsewhere. Still others are training as sailors and submariners who will deliver the combatpower of the United States to the farthest regions of the world -- and deliver compassionateassistance to those suffering from natural disasters. Whatever their chosen mission, everygraduate of the class of 2005 is bringing honor to the uniform -- and helping to bring usvictory in the war on terror. In the years ahead, you'll join them in the fight. Your service is needed, because our nation isengaged in a war that is being fought on many fronts -- from the streets of Western cities, tothe mountains of Afghanistan, the islands of Southeast Asia and the Horn of Africa. This war isgoing to take many turns, and the enemy must be defeated on every battlefield. Yet theterrorists have made it clear that Iraq is the central front in their war against humanity, andso we must recognize Iraq as the central front in the war on terror. As we fight the enemy in Iraq, every man and woman who volunteers to defend our nationdeserves an unwavering commitment to the mission -- and a clear strategy for victory. A clearstrategy begins with a clear understanding of the enemy we face. The enemy in Iraq is acombination of rejectionists, Saddamists and terrorists. The rejectionists are by far the largestgroup. These are ordinary Iraqis, mostly Sunni Arabs, who miss the privileged status they hadunder the regime of Saddam Hussein -- and they reject an Iraq in which they are no longerthe dominant group. Not all Sunnis fall into the rejectionist camp. Of those that do, most are not actively fightingus -- but some give aid and comfort to the enemy. Many Sunnis boycotted the Januaryelections -- yet as democracy takes hold in Iraq, they are recognizing that opting out of thedemocratic process has hurt their interests. And today, those who advocate violent oppositionare being increasingly isolated by Sunnis who choose peaceful participation in the democraticprocess. Sunnis voted in the recent constitutional referendum in large numbers -- and Sunnicoalitions have formed to compete in next month's elections -- or, this month's elections. Webelieve that, over time, most rejectionists will be persuaded to support a democratic Iraq ledby a federal government that is a strong enough government to protect minority rights. The second group that makes up the enemy in Iraq is smaller, but more determined. Itcontains former regime loyalists who held positions of power under Saddam Hussein -- peoplewho still harbor dreams of returning to power. These hard-core Saddamists are trying tofoment anti-democratic sentiment amongst the larger Sunni community. They lack popularsupport and therefore cannot stop Iraq's democratic progress. And over time, they can bemarginalized and defeated by the Iraqi people and the security forces of a free Iraq. The third group is the smallest, but the most lethal: the terrorists affiliated with or inspired byal Qaeda . Many are foreigners who are coming to fight freedom's progress in Iraq. This groupincludes terrorists from Saudi Arabia, and Syria, and Iran, and Egypt, and Sudan, and Yemen,and Libya, and other countries. Our commanders believe they're responsible for most of thesuicide bombings, and the beheadings, and the other atrocities we see on our television. They're led by a brutal terrorist named Zarqawi -- al Qaeda's chief of operations in Iraq -- whohas pledged his allegiance to Osama bin Laden. Their objective is to drive the United Statesand coalition forces out of Iraq, and use the vacuum that would be created by an Americanretreat to gain control of that country.They would then use Iraq as a base from which to launch attacks against America, andoverthrow moderate governments in the Middle East, and try to establish a totalitarian Islamicempire that reaches from Indonesia to Spain. That's their stated objective. That's what theirleadership has said. These terrorists have nothing to offer the Iraqi people. All they have is the capacity and thewillingness to kill the innocent and create chaos for the cameras. They are trying to shake ourwill to achieve their stated objectives. They will fail. America's will is strong. And they will failbecause the will to power is no match for the universal desire to live in liberty. The terrorists in Iraq share the same ideology as the terrorists who struck the United Stateson September the 11th. Those terrorists share the same ideology with those who blew upcommuters in London and Madrid, murdered tourists in Bali, workers in Riyadh, and guests ata wedding in Amman, Jordan. Just last week, they massacred Iraqi children and their parentsat a toy give-away outside an Iraqi hospital. This is an enemy without conscience -- and they cannot be appeased. If we were not fightingand destroying this enemy in Iraq, they would not be idle. They would be plotting and killingAmericans across the world and within our own borders. By fighting these terrorists in Iraq,Americans in uniform are defeating a direct threat to the American people. Against thisadversary, there is only one effective response: We will never back down. We will never givein. And we will never accept anything less than complete victory. To achieve victory over such enemies, we are pursuing a comprehensive strategy in Iraq.Americans should have a clear understanding of this strategy -- how we look at the war, howwe see the enemy, how we define victory, and what we're doing to achieve it. So today, we'rereleasing a document called the ""National Strategy for Victory in Iraq."" This is an unclassifiedversion of the strategy we've been pursuing in Iraq, and it is posted on the White Housewebsite -- whitehouse.gov. I urge all Americans to read it. Our strategy in Iraq has three elements. On the political side, we know that free societies arepeaceful societies, so we're helping the Iraqis build a free society with inclusive democraticinstitutions that will protect the interests of all Iraqis. We're working with the Iraqis to helpthem engage those who can be persuaded to join the new Iraq -- and to marginalize thosewho never will.On the security side, coalition and Iraqi security forces are on the offensive against theenemy, cleaning out areas controlled by the terrorists and Saddam loyalists, leaving Iraqiforces to hold territory taken from the enemy, and following up with targeted reconstructionto help Iraqis rebuild their lives. As we fight the terrorists, we're working to build capable and effective Iraqi security forces, sothey can take the lead in the fight -- and eventually take responsibility for the safety andsecurity of their citizens without major foreign assistance. And on the economic side, we're helping the Iraqis rebuild their infrastructure, reform theireconomy, and build the prosperity that will give all Iraqis a stake in a free and peaceful Iraq.In doing all this we have involved the United Nations, other international organizations, ourcoalition partners, and supportive regional states in helping Iraqis build their future. In the days ahead, I'll be discussing the various pillars of our strategy in Iraq. Today, I wantto speak in depth about one aspect of this strategy that will be critical to victory in Iraq -- andthat's the training of Iraqi security forces. To defeat the terrorists and marginalize theSaddamists and rejectionists, Iraqis need strong military and police forces. Iraqi troops bringknowledge and capabilities to the fight that coalition forces cannot. Iraqis know their people, they know their language, and they know their culture -- and theyknow who the terrorists are. Iraqi forces are earning the trust of their countrymen -- who arewilling to help them in the fight against the enemy. As the Iraqi forces grow in number,they're helping to keep a better hold on the cities taken from the enemy. And as the Iraqiforces grow more capable, they are increasingly taking the lead in the fight against theterrorists. Our goal is to train enough Iraqi forces so they can carry the fight -- and this willtake time and patience. And it's worth the time, and it's worth the effort -- because Iraqis andAmericans share a common enemy, and when that enemy is defeated in Iraq, Americans willbe safer here at home. The training of the Iraqi security forces is an enormous task, and it always hasn't gonesmoothly. We all remember the reports of some Iraqi security forces running from the fightmore than a year ago. Yet in the past year, Iraqi forces have made real progress. At this timelast year, there were only a handful of Iraqi battalions ready for combat.Now, there are over 120 Iraqi Army and Police combat battalions in the fight against theterrorists -- typically comprised of between 350 and 800 Iraqi forces. Of these, about 80 Iraqibattalions are fighting side-by-side with coalition forces, and about 40 others are taking thelead in the fight. Most of these 40 battalions are controlling their own battle space, andconducting their own operations against the terrorists with some coalition support -- andthey're helping to turn the tide of this struggle in freedom's favor. America and our troops areproud to stand with the brave Iraqi fighters. The progress of the Iraqi forces is especially clear when the recent anti-terrorist operations inTal Afar are compared with last year's assault in Fallujah. In Fallujah, the assault was led bynine coalition battalions made up primarily of United States Marines and Army -- with six Iraqibattalions supporting them. The Iraqis fought and sustained casualties. Yet in most situations,the Iraqi role was limited to protecting the flanks of coalition forces, and securing ground thathad already been cleared by our troops. This year in TAL Afar, it was a very different story. The assault was primarily led by Iraqi security forces -- 11 Iraqi battalions, backed by fivecoalition battalions providing support. Many Iraqi units conducted their own anti-terroristoperations and controlled their own battle space -- hunting for enemy fighters and securingneighborhoods block-by-block. To consolidate their military success, Iraqi units stayed behindto help maintain law and order -- and reconstruction projects have been started to improveinfrastructure and create jobs and provide hope. One of the Iraqi soldiers who fought in TAL Afar was a private named Tarek Hazem. Thisbrave Iraqi fighter says, ""We're not afraid. We're here to protect our country. All we feel ismotivated to kill the terrorists."" Iraqi forces not only cleared the city, they held it. Andbecause of the skill and courage of the Iraqi forces, the citizens of TAL Afar were able to votein October's constitutional referendum. As Iraqi forces increasingly take the lead in the fight against the terrorists, they're also takingcontrol of more and more Iraqi territory. At this moment, over 30 Iraqi Army battalions haveassumed primary control of their own areas of responsibility. In Baghdad, Iraqi battalionshave taken over major sectors of the capital -- including some of the city's toughestneighborhoods. Last year, the area around Baghdad's Haifa Street was so thick with terroriststhat it earned the nickname ""Purple Heart Boulevard."" Then Iraqi forces took responsibility forthis dangerous neighborhood -- and attacks are now down.Our coalition has handed over roughly 90 square miles of Baghdad province to Iraqi securityforces. Iraqi battalions have taken over responsibility for areas in South-Central Iraq, sectorsof Southeast Iraq, sectors of Western Iraq, and sectors of North-Central Iraq. As Iraqi forcestake responsibility for more of their own territory, coalition forces can concentrate on trainingIraqis and hunting down high-value targets, like the terrorist Zarqawi and his associates. We're also transferring forward operating bases to Iraqi control. Over a dozen bases in Iraqhave been handed over to the Iraqi government -- including Saddam Hussein's former palacein Tikrit, which has served as the coalition headquarters in one of Iraq's most dangerousregions. From many of these bases, the Iraqi security forces are planning and executingoperations against the terrorists -- and bringing security and pride to the Iraqi people. Progress by the Iraqi security forces has come, in part, because we learned from our earlierexperiences and made changes in the way we help train Iraqi troops. When our coalition firstarrived, we began the process of creating an Iraqi Army to defend the country from externalthreats, and an Iraqi Civil Defense Corps to help provide the security within Iraq's borders.The civil defense forces did not have sufficient firepower or training -- they proved to be nomatch for an enemy armed with machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades, and mortars. Sothe approach was adjusted. Working with Iraq's leaders, we moved the civil defense forcesinto the Iraqi Army, we changed the way they're trained and equipped, and we focused theArmy's mission on defeating those fighting against a free Iraq, whether internal or external. Now, all Iraqi Army recruits receive about the same length of basic training as new recruits inthe U.S. Army -- a five-week core course, followed by an additional three-to-seven weeks ofspecialized training. With coalition help, Iraqis have established schools for the Iraqi militaryservices, an Iraqi military academy, a non-commissioned officer academy, a military policeschool, a bomb disposal school -- and NATO has established an Iraqi Joint Staff College.There's also an increased focus on leadership training, with professional development coursesfor Iraqi squad leaders and platoon sergeants and warrant officers and sergeants-major. Anew generation of Iraqi officers is being trained, leaders who will lead their forces with skill --so they can defeat the terrorists and secure their freedom.Similar changes have taken place in the training of the Iraqi police. When our coalition firstarrived, Iraqi police recruits spent too much time of their training in classroom lectures -- andthey received limited training in the use of small arms. This did not adequately prepare thefight they would face. And so we changed the way the Iraqi police are trained. Now, policerecruits spend more of their time outside the classroom with intensive hands-on training inanti-terrorism operations and real-world survival skills. Iraq has now six basic police academies, and one in Jordan, that together produce over 3,500new police officers every ten weeks. The Baghdad police academy has simulation modelswhere Iraqis train to stop IED attacks and operate roadblocks. And because Iraqi police arenot just facing common criminals, they are getting live-fire training with the AK-47s. As more and more skilled Iraqi security forces have come online, there's been anotherimportant change in the way new Iraqi recruits are trained. When the training effort began,nearly all the trainers came from coalition countries. Today, the vast majority of Iraqi policeand army recruits are being taught by Iraqi instructors. By training the trainers, we're helpingIraqis create an institutional capability that will allow the Iraqi forces to continue to developand grow long after coalition forces have left Iraq. As the training has improved, so has the quality of the recruits being trained. Even though theterrorists are targeting Iraqi police and army recruits, there is no shortage of Iraqis who arewilling to risk their lives to secure the future of a free Iraq. The efforts to include more Sunnis in the future of Iraq were given a significant boost earlierthis year. More than 60 influential Sunni clerics issued a fatwa calling on young Sunnis to jointhe Iraqi security forces, ""for the sake of preserving the souls, property and honor"" of theIraqi people. These religious leaders are helping to make the Iraqi security forces a trulynational institution -- one that is able to serve, protect and defend all the Iraqi people. Some critics dismiss this progress and point to the fact that only one Iraqi battalion hasachieved complete independence from the coalition. To achieve complete independence, anIraqi battalion must do more than fight the enemy on its own -- it must also have the abilityto provide its own support elements, including logistics, airlift, intelligence, and command andcontrol through their ministries. Not every Iraqi unit has to meet this level of capability inorder for the Iraqi security forces to take the lead in the fight against the enemy.As a matter of fact, there are some battalions from NATO militaries that would not be able tomeet this standard. The facts are that Iraqi units are growing more independent and morecapable; they are defending their new democracy with courage and determination. They're inthe fight today, and they will be in the fight for freedom tomorrow. We're also helping Iraqis build the institutions they need to support their own forces. Forexample, a national depot has been established north of Baghdad that is responsible forsupplying the logistical needs of the ten divisions of the Iraqi Army. Regional support unitsand base support units have been created across the country with the mission of supplyingtheir own war fighters. Iraqis now have a small Air Force, that recently conducted its firstcombat airlift operations -- bringing Iraqi troops to the front in TAL Afar. The new Iraqi Navyis now helping protect the vital ports of Basra and Umm Qasr. An Iraqi military intelligenceschool has been established to produce skilled Iraqi intelligence analysts and collectors. Bytaking all these steps, we're helping the Iraqi security forces become self-supporting so theycan take the fight to the enemy, and so they can sustain themselves in the fight. Over the past two and a half years, we've faced some setbacks in standing up a capable Iraqisecurity force -- and their performance is still uneven in some areas. Yet many of those forceshave made real gains over the past year -- and Iraqi soldiers take pride in their progress. AnIraqi first lieutenant named Shoqutt describes the transformation of his unit this way: ""I reallythink we've turned the corner here. At first, the whole country didn't take us seriously. Nowthings are different. Our guys are hungry to demonstrate their skill and to show the world."" Our troops in Iraq see the gains that Iraqis are making. Lieutenant Colonel Todd Wood ofRichmond Hill, Georgia, is training Iraqi forces in Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit. Hesays this about the Iraqi units he is working with: ""They're pretty much ready to go it on theirown ... What they're doing now would have been impossible a year ago ... These guys arepatriots, willing to go out knowing the insurgents would like nothing better than to kill themand their families ... They're getting better, and they'll keep getting better."" Our commanders on the ground see the gains the Iraqis are making. General Marty Dempseyis the commander of the Multinational Security Transition Command. Here's what he saysabout the transformation of the Iraqi security forces: ""It's beyond description. They are farbetter equipped, far better trained"" than they once were.The Iraqis, General Dempsey says, are ""increasingly in control of their future and their ownsecurity _ the Iraqi security forces are regaining control of the country."" As the Iraqi security forces stand up, their confidence is growing and they are taking ontougher and more important missions on their own. As the Iraqi security forces stand up, theconfidence of the Iraqi people is growing -- and Iraqis are providing the vital intelligenceneeded to track down the terrorists. And as the Iraqi security forces stand up, coalition forcescan stand down -- and when our mission of defeating the terrorists in Iraq is complete, ourtroops will return home to a proud nation. This is a goal our Iraqi allies share. An Iraqi Army Sergeant named Abbass Abdul Jabar puts itthis way: ""We have to help the coalition forces as much as we can to give them a chance togo home. These guys have been helping us. [Now] we have to protect our own families.""America will help the Iraqis so they can protect their families and secure their free nation. Wewill stay as long as necessary to complete the mission. If our military leaders tell me we needmore troops, I will send them. For example, we have increased our force levels in Iraq to 160,000 -- up from 137,000 -- inpreparation for the December elections. My commanders tell me that as Iraqi forces becomemore capable, the mission of our forces in Iraq will continue to change. We will continue toshift from providing security and conducting operations against the enemy nationwide, toconducting more specialized operations targeted at the most dangerous terrorists. We willincreasingly move out of Iraqi cities, reduce the number of bases from which we operate, andconduct fewer patrols and convoys. As the Iraqi forces gain experience and the political process advances, we will be able todecrease our troop levels in Iraq without losing our capability to defeat the terrorists. Thesedecisions about troop levels will be driven by the conditions on the ground in Iraq and thegood judgment of our commanders -- not by artificial timetables set by politicians inWashington. Some are calling for a deadline for withdrawal. Many advocating an artificial timetable forwithdrawing our troops are sincere -- but I believe they're sincerely wrong. Pulling our troopsout before they've achieved their purpose is not a plan for victory.As Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman said recently, setting an artificial timetable would""discourage our troops because it seems to be heading for the door. It will encourage theterrorists, it will confuse the Iraqi people."" Senator Lieberman is right. Setting an artificial deadline to withdraw would send a messageacross the world that America is a weak and an unreliable ally. Setting an artificial deadline towithdraw would send a signal to our enemies -- that if they wait long enough, America will cutand run and abandon its friends. And setting an artificial deadline to withdraw would vindicatethe terrorists' tactics of beheadings and suicide bombings and mass murder -- and invite newattacks on America. To all who wear the uniform, I make you this pledge: America will not runin the face of car bombers and assassins so long as I am your Commander-in-Chief. And as we train Iraqis to take more responsibility in the battle with the terrorists, we're alsohelping them build a democracy that is worthy of their sacrifice. And in just over two-and-a-half years, the Iraqi people have made incredible progress on the road to lasting freedom.Iraqis have gone from living under the boot of a brutal tyrant, to liberation, free elections, anda democratic constitution -- and in 15 days they will go to the polls to elect a fullyconstitutional government that will lead them for the next four years. With each ballot cast, the Iraqi people have sent a clear message to the terrorists: Iraqis willnot be intimidated. The Iraqi people will determine the destiny of their country. The future ofIraq belongs to freedom. Despite the costs, the pain, and the danger, Iraqis are showingcourage and are moving forward to build a free society and a lasting democracy in the heartof the Middle East -- and the United States of America will help them succeed. Some critics continue to assert that we have no plan in Iraq except to, ""stay the course."" If by""stay the course,"" they mean we will not allow the terrorists to break our will, they are right.If by ""stay the course,"" they mean we will not permit al Qaeda to turn Iraq into whatAfghanistan was under the Taliban -- a safe haven for terrorism and a launching pad forattacks on America -- they are right, as well. If by ""stay the course"" they mean that we're notlearning from our experiences, or adjusting our tactics to meet the challenges on the ground,then they're flat wrong. As our top commander in Iraq, General Casey, has said, ""Ourcommanders on the ground are continuously adapting and adjusting, not only to what theenemy does, but also to try to out-think the enemy and get ahead of him.""Our strategy in Iraq is clear, our tactics are flexible and dynamic; we have changed them asconditions required and they are bringing us victory against a brutal enemy. Victory in Iraq will demand the continued determination and resolve of the American people.It will also demand the strength and personal courage of the men and women who wear ournation's uniform. And as the future officers of the United States Navy and Marine Corps,you're preparing to join this fight. You do so at a time when there is a vigorous debate aboutthe war in Iraq. I know that for our men and women in uniform, this debate can be unsettling-- when you're risking your life to accomplish a mission, the last thing you want to hear is thatmission being questioned in our nation's capital. I want you to know that while there may be alot of heated rhetoric in Washington, D.C., one thing is not in dispute: The American peoplestand behind you. And we should not fear the debate in Washington. It's one of the great strengths of ourdemocracy that we can discuss our differences openly and honestly -- even at times of war.Your service makes that freedom possible. And today, because of the men and women in ourmilitary, people are expressing their opinions freely in the streets of Baghdad, as well. Most Americans want two things in Iraq: They want to see our troops win, and they want tosee our troops come home as soon as possible. And those are my goals as well. I will settlefor nothing less than complete victory. In World War II, victory came when the Empire ofJapan surrendered on the deck of the USS Missouri. In Iraq, there will not be a signingceremony on the deck of a battleship. Victory will come when the terrorists and Saddamistscan no longer threaten Iraq's democracy, when the Iraqi security forces can provide for thesafety of their own citizens, and when Iraq is not a safe haven for terrorists to plot newattacks on our nation. As we make progress toward victory, Iraqis will take more responsibility for their security, andfewer U.S. forces will be needed to complete the mission. America will not abandon Iraq. Wewill not turn that country over to the terrorists and put the American people at risk. Iraq willbe a free nation and a strong ally in the Middle East -- and this will add to the security of theAmerican people.In the short run, we're going to bring justice to our enemies. In the long run, the best way toensure the security of our own citizens is to spread the hope of freedom across the broaderMiddle East. We've seen freedom conquer evil and secure the peace before. In World War II,free nations came together to fight the ideology of fascism, and freedom prevailed -- andtoday Germany and Japan are democracies and they are allies in securing the peace. In theCold War, freedom defeated the ideology of communism and led to a democratic movementthat freed the nations of Eastern and Central Europe from Soviet domination -- and todaythese nations are allies in the war on terror. Today in the Middle East freedom is once again contending with an ideology that seeks to sowanger and hatred and despair. And like fascism and communism before, the hateful ideologiesthat use terror will be defeated by the unstoppable power of freedom, and as democracyspreads in the Middle East, these countries will become allies in the cause of peace. Advancing the cause of freedom and democracy in the Middle East begins with ensuring thesuccess of a free Iraq. Freedom's victory in that country will inspire democratic reformers fromDamascus to Tehran, and spread hope across a troubled region, and lift a terrible threat fromthe lives of our citizens. By strengthening Iraqi democracy, we will gain a partner in the causeof peace and moderation in the Muslim world, and an ally in the worldwide struggle against --against the terrorists. Advancing the ideal of democracy and self-government is the missionthat created our nation -- and now it is the calling of a new generation of Americans. We willmeet the challenge of our time. We will answer history's call with confidence -- because weknow that freedom is the destiny of every man, woman and child on this earth. Before our mission in Iraq is accomplished, there will be tough days ahead. A time of war is atime of sacrifice, and we've lost some very fine men and women in this war on terror. Many ofyou know comrades and classmates who left our shores to defend freedom and who did notlive to make the journey home. We pray for the military families who mourn the loss of lovesones. We hold them in our hearts -- and we honor the memory of every fallen soldier, sailor,airman, Coast Guardsman, and Marine. One of those fallen heroes is a Marine Corporal named Jeff Starr, who was killed fighting theterrorists in Ramadi earlier this year. After he died, a letter was found on his laptop computer.Here's what he wrote, he said, ""[I]f you're reading this, then I've died in Iraq. I don't regretgoing. Everybody dies, but few get to do it for something as important as freedom.It may seem confusing why we are in Iraq, it's not to me. I'm here helping these people, sothey can live the way we live. Not [to] have to worry about tyrants or vicious dictators_.Others have died for my freedom, now this is my mark."" There is only one way to honor the sacrifice of Corporal Starr and his fallen comrades -- andthat is to take up their mantle, carry on their fight, and complete their mission. We will take the fight to the terrorists. We will help the Iraqi people lay the foundations of astrong democracy that can govern itself, sustain itself, and defend itself. And by laying thefoundations of freedom in Iraq, we will lay the foundation of peace for generations to come.You all are the ones who will help accomplish all this. Our freedom and our way of life are inyour hands -- and they're in the best of hands. I want to thank you for your service in thecause of freedom. I want to thank you for wearing the uniform.May God bless you all, and may God continue to bless the United States of America.",bush
"Nellie, thank you very much. I appreciate the invitation to speak. I'm calling from Manhattan,Kansas. Sounds like you got some good folks from Kansas there. I want to thank everybodythere -- if you're from Kansas, or anywhere else in our country, for your devotion to such anoble cause.You believe, as I do, that every human life has value, that the strong have a duty to protectthe weak, and that the self-evident truths of the Declaration of Independence apply toeveryone, not just to those considered healthy or wanted or convenient. These principles callus to defend the sick and the dying, persons with disabilities and birth defects, all who areweak and vulnerable, especially unborn children.We're making good progress in defending these principles, Nellie, and you and I are workingtogether, along with others, to build what I've called a ""culture of life."" One of my first acts asthe President was to ban the use of taxpayer money on programs that promote abortionoverseas.I want to thank you all for getting that ban on partial-birth abortion to my desk, a bill I wasproud to sign -- and a law which we are going to defend -- and are defending -- vigorously inour courts. Because we acted, infants who are born despite an attempted abortion are nowprotected by law. Thanks to ""Laci and Conner's Law,"" prosecutors can now charge those whoharm or kill a pregnant woman with harming or killing her unborn child, as well.We're vigorously promoting parental notification laws, adoption, teen abstinence, crisispregnancy programs, and the vital work of our faith-based groups. We're sending a clearmessage to any woman facing a crisis pregnancy: We love you; we love your child, and we'rehere to help you.There's more work to be done. The House has passed a bill to ensure that state parentalinvolvement laws are not circumvented by those who take minors across state lines to haveabortion[s]. And the United States Senate needs to pass this bill so I can sign it into law.We also must respect human life and dignity when advancing medical science, and we'remaking progress here, as well. Last month, I signed a pro-life bill supporting ethical treatmentand research using stem cells from umbilical cord blood. I also renew my call for Congress toban all forms of human cloning. Because human life is a gift from our Creator and shouldnever be used as a means to an end, we will not sanction the creation of life only to destroy it.By changing laws we can change our culture. And your persistence and prayers, Nellie, andthe folks there with you, are making a real difference. We, of course, seek common groundwhere possible; we're working to persuade more of our fellow Americans of the rightness ofour cause. And this is a cause that appeals to the conscience of our citizens, and is rooted inAmerica's deepest principles -- and history tells us that with such a cause, we will prevail.Again, Nellie, thank you for letting me come to speak to you. Tell everybody there that I askfor God's blessings on them and their families, and, of course, may God continue to bless ourgrand country.",bush
"Thanks for the warm welcome. Thanks for inviting me here to give the Landon Lecture. Forthose students who are here, I want you to know I can remember what it was like to sitthrough lectures. I didn't particularly like it then. Some will take a little different approach. I'mhere to tell you how I see the world and how I've made some of the decisions I've made andwhy I made them. Before I get there, I want to thank the introducer. So he's on Air Force One. He says, that's acute-looking blue tie you have. But I strongly suggest, Mr. President -- I said, I don't know,Senator, if I can take it; I'm worried about all those lobby laws -- or the lack of them. He said,fine, I'll just loan it to you. I said, well, now that you're helping me dress, you got any hintson how I ought to do my hair?Pat Roberts is a good man. He's got a great sense of humor. He loves the people of Kansasand he loves Kansas State and I'm proud to be with him on this stage. And I'm proud to behere, as well, with the other United States Senator, Senator Sam Brownback. Formerpresident of the Kansas State student body.I want to thank the Governor. Governor Sebelius, thanks for putting up with me, Roberts andBrownback as we drove from the airport to here. One hour with the three of us -- it required alot of patience. I'm proud the Governor came with us, and I want to thank you. I want tothank Congressman Jim Ryun, right from this district. I appreciate you being here,Congressman. I'm not interested in jogging with you.I also thank Congressman Dennis Moore and Congressman Jerry Moran, both fine members ofthe United Stated Congress from the state of Kansas. Thank you all for coming.I appreciate President Wefald for having me come. I know Laura was his first choice. That'swhy he's the head of such a fine institution; he's got good judgment. By the way, she sendsher best. I married really well.And I want to thank Charles Reagan and Edward Seaton. Charles is the chairman of theLandon Lecture Series. And Edward is the head of the patrons. He said to me, he said, I soappreciate you believing in free speech; thanks for giving a free one.I want to thank Tom Herald, who is the faculty senate president. I want to thank all thefaculty members who are here. Thanks for teaching. It's such a noble profession and Iappreciate you lending your expertise to help youngsters learn what is possible and how tothink, and how to be creative. And I want to thank the president of the student body, MichaelBurns, for being here, as well.I appreciate the students being here. I particularly want to thank those who've come from theLast Chance Bar. Better than watching daytime TV I guess. I appreciate your interest in yourcountry; looking forward to sharing some thoughts with you, and then I'll answer somequestions. Before I get there, I do want to pay tribute to our wonderful men and women in uniform.Thank you for serving our country.You know, really one of the interesting things about being the President is to invite my guys,buddies I grew up with from Texas, to the White House. It's really neat to see how they reactto the majesty of the White House and the Oval Office and the South Lawn, and just thebeauty of Washington. And most of them, after they get over the initial shock of seeing theWhite House, then come to the shock wondering how in the heck I got there.But they, oftentimes, they ask me, they say, what's it like, being the President of the UnitedStates? And my answer to them is, first, it's a huge honor. But, secondly, if I had to give youa job description, it would be a decision-maker. I make a lot of decisions. I make some thatyou see that obviously affect people's lives, not only here, but around the world. I make a lotof small ones you never see, but have got consequence. Decision-maker is the job description.First of all, when you make decisions, you've got to stand on principle. If you're going to makedecisions, you've got to know what you believe. I guess the best way to summarize me is Icame from Texas and I'm going back to Texas with the exact same values I had when Iarrived in Washington, D.C.In order to make good decisions, you've got to rely upon the judgment of people you trust. I'llnever forget the first decision I had to make as the President. I wasn't even sworn in yet, anda fellow called me on the phone and he said, what color rug do you want to have in the OvalOffice? You've got to be kidding me, man. He said, no, what color rug would you like to havein the Oval Office? I said, I don't know. He said, well, it turns out that Presidents -- you'vejust got to know Presidents design their rugs. I said, well, to be honest with you, I don't knowmuch about designing rugs.So I called, I delegated -- that's one of the things you do in decision-making. I said, Laura,how about helping design the rug? Part of being a decision-maker, though, is you've got tohelp -- you've got to think strategically. And so I said to her -- she said, what color do youwant? I said, make it say this: optimistic person comes here to work every single day. Youcan't lead the nation, you can't make good decisions unless you're optimistic about the future.So for the students here, as you take over organizations or head out of college and becomeinvolved in your life, you've got to be optimistic about -- if you're going to lead somebody.Imagine somebody saying, follow me, the world is going to be worse.That's not a very good organizing principle about which to lead people. I'm optimistic aboutour future, and the reason I am is because I believe so strongly in what America stands for:liberty and freedom and human rights, and the human dignity of every single person.Sometimes decisions come to your desk unexpectedly. Part of the job of a President is to beable to plan for the worst and hope for the best; and if the worst comes, be able to react to it.On September the 11th, the worst came. We got attacked. We didn't ask for the attack, but itcame. I resolved on that day to do everything I can to protect the American people. You know, a lot of us grew up thinking that oceans would protect us; that if there was a threatoverseas, it really didn't concern us because we were safe. That's what history had basicallytold us -- yes, there was an attack on Pearl Harbor, obviously, but it was a kind of hit-and-runand then we pursued the enemy. A lot of folks -- at least, my age, when I was going tocollege, I never dreamed that the United States of America could be attacked. And in that wegot attacked, I vowed then, like I'm vowing to you today, that I understand my mostimportant priority. My most important job is to protect the security of the American people. I knew right after September the 11th, though, that the attacks would begin to fade inpeople's memory. I mean, who wants to constantly go through life thinking that you're goingto get hit again? Who wants to kind of re-live those days in your memory? As a matter of fact,I asked the American people to go on about your life. But given the fact that it's humannature to forget, or try to put in the past, put the pain in the past, I want to assure you andour fellow Americans I'm not going to put it in the past. The threat to the United States isforefront in my mind. I knew that at times people would say, you know, it may be an isolatedincident, let's just don't worry about it. Well, for me it's not an isolated incident. I understandthere is still an enemy which lurks out there. And so part of my decision-making process, part of it as you see when I begin to protect you,to do my number one priority, rests upon this fact: that there is an enemy which is relentlessand desirous to bring harm to the American people, because of what we believe in. See, we'rein an ideological struggle. It's very important for the students here to understand that there isan enemy which has an ideology, and they're driven by an ideology. They make decisionsbased upon their view of the world, which is the exact opposite of our view of the world.Perhaps the best way to describe their political vision is to remind you what life was like forpeople living in Afghanistan when the Taliban was running that country with al Qaeda as theparasite. If you were a young girl in that society, you had no chance to get educated. If youspoke out against the view of these folks, their religious view, you could be taken to the publicsquare and whipped. In other words, there was not freedom. There wasn't freedom to worshipthe way you want to, just like we believe here in the United States of America. You canworship, you can not worship in our country, and you're equally American. You can be aChristian, Jew or Muslim, and you're equally American. It's the greatness of the United Statesof America which -- which stands in stark contrast to what these ideologues believe. Their vision of the world is dark and dim. They have got desires to spread a totalitarianempire. How do we know? Because they told us. Mr. Zawahiri, the number two in the al Qaedanetwork, told the world such. He might not have wanted us to read that particular thing hewas sending, but nevertheless we did. And he said that, here's our designs and our desires. Inother words, these people have got an ideology, and strategy to implement the ideology.They've got a -- they have no heart, no conscience. They kill innocent men, women andchildren to achieve their objective. These folks cannot be appeased. We can't hope that nicewords will change their point of view. And so the decision I made right off the bat is we will find them, and we will hunt them down,and we will bring them to justice before they hurt America again.But that requires a different kind of response than the old days of nations fighting nations.First of all, I want to step back and just tell you -- I probably -- I hope I say this more thanonce, but committing U.S. troops into harm's way is the last option of the President. It's thehardest decision a President can make. And so when I'm telling you I made the decision, youall have got to understand, I did not take that decision lightly. I knew the consequences, but Ialso believed that the consequences of not acting against this enemy would mean I wasn'tdoing my job of working with others to protect the United States of America.So we sent our men and women into harm's way -- all volunteers. It is really important for theUnited States of America to have an all-volunteer Army. The best way to keep peoplevolunteering in the Army is to make sure they got good pay, good training, good equipmentand good housing for their loved ones.But since we're not able to track vast battalions or armadas, we've got to have intelligence,good intelligence, to help us locate the dark corners of the world where these people hide. Alot of the decisions I make, and decisions future Presidents make, will be based upon thecapacity of our intelligence services to find the enemy and to understand the intentions of theenemy and to share information with our allies. This is a different kind of struggle andrequires the best intelligence possible. That's why we're reevaluating, constantly reevaluating,how best to use our intelligence services to be able to protect the American people. We've got to be strong in diplomacy. Secretary Rice, who is a great diplomat, she followedanother great -- she followed another great diplomat in Colin Powell -- they're constantlyworking to remind people about the stakes. Just like part of my job is to educate the Americanpeople about the threats we face, at a lecture series such as this, our government mustconstantly remind our friends and allies the nature of the enemy and the stakes that all freecountries face. There's a diplomatic effort that's constantly going on. You can't run your network without money, and so we're working with our friends and allies toseize terrorist assets and choke off their funding sources. In other words, what I'm telling youis, we're using all assets at our disposal to protect you in a different kind of war. In order tomake the right decision about how to win this war, it's important to understand the nature ofthe enemy and to take the enemy's word seriously and to understand their lethality and notlet the kind of lull in the action lull us to sleep.Secondly, right after they attacked us, I laid out a doctrine, and it said, if you harbor aterrorist, you're equally as guilty as the terrorists. The reason I said that is because Iunderstand that a terrorist network can sometimes burrow in society and can sometimes findsafe haven from which to plot and plan. The perfect example of that was Afghanistan. Forthose of you who didn't pay much attention to the initial stages of this war, it becameapparent to the world that Afghanistan became a safe haven. You'll hear stories about peoplethat went into Afghanistan to be trained -- trained as to how to brutally kill people, trained indifferent methodologies, trained in how to communicate.So in other words, the enemy was able to burrow in, and felt safe and confident and secure.And I understood in this different kind of war that we had to make it clear to any country thatif they harbored a terrorist, they would be held to account. And when the American Presidentspeaks, it's really important for those words to mean something.And so when I said to the Taliban, get rid of al Qaeda, and they didn't, I made the difficultdecision to commit our troops, to uphold the doctrine that if you harbor a terrorist, you'reequally as guilty as the terrorist. And our kids went in, men and women alike, and liberated acountry from the clutches of the barbaric regime, the Taliban.And today, today in Afghanistan, think about what has happened in a brief period of time --today in Afghanistan there is a fledgling democracy. Al Qaeda no longer has run of thecountry; the Taliban is routed; there's an elected parliament and a president dedicated todemocratic institutions.The doctrine still stands: If you harbor a terrorist, you're equally as guilty as the terroristswho commit murder.Thirdly -- and this is very important for the students to understand, and others -- becauseoceans no longer protect us, the United States of America must confront threats before theycause us harm. In other words, in the old days we could see a threat and say, well, maybe itwill cause harm, maybe it won't. Those days changed, as far as I'm concerned. Threats mustbe taken seriously now, because geography doesn't protect us and there's an enemy that stilllurks. And so early in my first term, I looked at the world and saw a threat in SaddamHussein. And let me tell you why I saw the threat. First of all, there was an immediate threat because he was shooting at our airplanes. Therewas what's called no-fly zones; that meant the Iraqis couldn't fly in the zones, and we werepatrolling with British pilots. And he was firing at us, which was a threat -- a threat to the lifeand limb of the troops to whom I'm the Commander-in-Chief. He was a state sponsor ofterror. In other words, the government had declared, you are a state sponsor of terror. And,remember, we're dealing with terrorist networks that would like to do us harm. There's a reason why he was declared a state sponsor of terror -- because he was sponsoringterror. He had used weapons of mass destruction. And the biggest threat that this President,and future Presidents, must worry about is weapons of mass destruction getting in the handsof a terrorist network that would like to do us harm. That is the biggest threat we face.Airplanes were horrible; the attacks of aircraft were horrible. But the damage done could bemultiplied if weapons of mass destruction were in the hands of these people.The world thought Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. It wasn't just me or myadministration. Our predecessor thought he had weapons of mass destruction. And there's alogical reason why -- the data showed that he likely had weapons of mass destruction, andhe'd use them. I told you, the last option for a President is to send troops into combat, and Iwas hoping that we could solve the issue, the threat, the threat to the United States bydiplomatic means. So I went to the United Nations. Secretary Powell carried our message to the United Nations.It said --- see, now, I actually gave a speech to the United Nations, you might remember, andI said to them, basically, how many resolutions is it going to take before this threat will takeus seriously? I mean, we passed, I don't know, 14, 15 different resolutions. That's a lot ofresolutions. Pretty soon, if you pass that many resolutions, somebody is going to say, well,they may not mean anything. I want this body to be effective. It's important for the world,when it speaks, that people listen. And so we passed another resolution that said that Saddam is in -- and it unanimouslypassed, and the reason why is because the world thought he was a danger. It said: disarm,disclose, or face serious consequences. I'm the kind of fellow, when I -- when we saysomething, I mean it, like I told you before. And I meant it. And so Saddam Hussein was given a choice. He chose war. And so we moved and he wasremoved from power. And there is absolutely no doubt in my mind, America is safer for it, andthe world is better off without Saddam Hussein.A lot of people, I understand, disagreed with that decision, and that's what democracy is allabout, that's what we believe in. We believe you can disagree. There's a custom in ourcountry for people to express themselves, and it's good. It's what makes us a great country,that people can stand up and tell people what's on their mind. And we're going to keep it thatway. It's very important for those who didn't agree with the decision, though, to understandthe consequences of success in Iraq. It's really important we succeed, for a lot of reasons. And the definition of success, by the way, is for there to be a country where the terrorists andSaddamists can no longer threaten the democracy, and where Iraqi security forces canprovide for the security of their people, and where Iraq is not a safe haven from which theterrorists -- al Qaeda and its affiliates -- can plot attacks against America.We got a strategy, and I'm going to keep talking about the strategy -- it will yield a victory.And the strategy is political security and economic in nature. In economic, we're going to helpthem rebuild their country, help secure their oil supply so they'll have cash flow in order toinvest in their people. On the political front, you've seen it -- you've seen what happened in one year's time. It's justamazing, I think. I guess, we take it for granted -- some of us do. I don't. The fact that peoplehave gone from living under the clutches of a tyrant who ordered the murder of thousands ofhis own citizens, to a society in which people last year started voting -- voting for an interimgovernment, voting for a constitution, and then voting for a permanent government under thenew constitution. The government is now -- they're beginning to form. In other words, you're seeing a lot of sharp elbows, probably kind of like American politicsseem to some people, a lot of throwing of sharp elbows. You didn't see a lot of elbows,political elbows being thrown under the tyrant, did you? That's because tyrants don't allow forthe political process to evolve. But we're watching the political process evolve, madecomplicated by the fact that the terrorists still want to cause destruction and death as thisgovernment is forming to try to stop it. We got to step back and ask why. Why would they want to stop democracy? And the answer,because democracy stands for the exact opposite of their vision. Liberty is not their credo.And they understand a defeat to their ideology by the establishment of a free Iraq will be adevastating blow for their vision. And so the Iraqis are showing incredible courage. When somebody says, if you vote, I'm goingto get you, sometimes people maybe say, well, maybe I don't want to vote. Eleven million orso Iraqis went to the polls in defiance of these killers. It's a magical moment in the history ofliberty. And then on the security front, our strategy can be summed up this way: As the Iraqis standup, we'll stand down. Look, we want the Iraqis to be prepared to take the fight to the enemy.Let me talk about the enemy real quick in Iraq. There are what we call ""rejectionists."" Theseare Sunnis that kind of like the fact that they -- even though a minority inside the country --had the upper hand for a long period of time with Saddam.And they're worried about whether or not a constitution that says it will protect minority rightsactually will protect minority rights. But the good news is, more and more Sunnis started tovote. And if you watch the news, they're beginning to negotiate, they're beginning to see abetter way. In other words, the political process is beginning to marginalize the remainingelements of those who are trying to stop the progress. One of those elements is Saddamists. These are the thugs that kind of control the country.They loved power; they don't want to give it up. And they'd like to return to the good olddays, which isn't going to happen. And the other group of course, is the al Qaeda types, Mr. Zarqawi, who wants us to leaveIraq. They want us to get out of Iraq so Iraq can be a safe haven. It is their stated objective:Don't worry, take your time, keep killing the innocent because America will lose its will. That'swhat the enemy has said. That's their words. The way to defeat the enemy is for the political process to marginalize the rejectionists, andfor us to train the Iraqi forces so they can find the few that want to dash the hopes of themany, and that's what we're doing. Our strategy is twofold: We're on the hunt for the terrorists, and we're training Iraqis. Andwe're making decent progress. There are more and more Iraqi units in the fight. There's moreand more country being turned over to the Iraqis. We got a lot of bases around Iraq, andmore of those bases are being given to the Iraqi troops. This is the year that we'll not only continue to focus on the troops, we'll continue to train Iraqipolice. We've seen some problems about what it means to have lived in a society wherepeople want to seek revenge. In other words, they use their police -- status as a police personto take it out on others because of past grievances. That's not acceptable to the United Statesof America. And it's not acceptable to most Iraqis, either. And so part of the training for police is not only to give them the capacity to handle theenemy, but to make sure they understand human rights and ethics involved with police work.And so that's what you'll be seeing. You're going to see more Iraqi troops in the fight, andmore police providing security.And as a result, our commanders on the ground informed me that they thought we couldreduce our troop level from the 168,000 that were there -- 165,000, more or less, that werethere for the election -- below 138,000. Now, I want to emphasize something to you, you heard me say, ""our commanders on theground said."" You see, sometimes in the political process people feel beholden to polls andfocus groups. You don't have to worry about me. I'm going to be listening to the people thatknow what they're talking about, and that's the commanders on the ground in Iraq.  They'llmake the decisions. They will give the advice. Conditions on the ground will dictate our forcelevels over the next year, but the strategy is what I said it is: We'll stay on the offense, andwe'll give these brave Iraqis the skills and training necessary to defend their own democracy.Look, this enemy cannot beat us. They cannot defeat us militarily. There's no chance. The oneweapon they have, which is a lethal weapon, is the willingness to kill people. I remember thestory -- and it just broke my heart to think about the young soldier that was giving candy to akid, and they set off the car bomb next to the kids. I mean, it's just -- I cannot describe toyou how brutal these people are. And they understand that their scenes will get on TV. And Idon't know if they can adequately understand the compassion of the American people. Butwe're compassionate.I told you one of the great beliefs of our country is every life matters, every person counts --whether it be a child here in America, or a child in Iraq. And they understand. And so part ofmy decision-making process is to understand the strength of the enemy -- the only strengththey have -- and continue to remind the people that is their only strength, and the only waywe can lose is if we lose our nerve and our will. The American people are resolute. They arestrong. And we're not going to lose our will to these thugs and murderers.In there long-term -- in the short-term, we'll stay on the offense; in the long-term, the way todefeat these people is to spread liberty. As you study history, I want you to watch the effectsof freedom around the world. One of my favorite ways to describe my belief in the capacity offreedom to help achieve peace -- not only security for the American people, but peace -- is togive people the example of my dad and me, in terms of Japan.My dad was an 18-year-old kid and went to fight the Japanese. I promise you, a lot of folkshere, relatives, did the same thing. They were called into action because the enemy hadattacked us. They were the sworn enemy of the United States of America. It was a brutal waragainst the Japanese. Took a lot of lives -- Japanese lives and American lives -- to win thatwar. And, today, like my recent trip to the Far East, I sit down with Prime Minister Koizumi,who is the Japanese Prime Minister, and talk about the peace. Now, think about that. Iparticularly want the students to think about what took place when 18-year-old President 41was fighting the Japanese, and 59-year-old 43 -- that would be me -- is talking to the PrimeMinister of the former enemy about peace. And you know what took place? A Japanese-styledemocracy came to be. History has shown that democracies yield the peace. Europe is free, whole, and at peacebecause the nations are democratic. That wasn't always the case, obviously, in the 1900s.Two major wars were fought where a lot of Americans died, and yet systems and forms ofgovernment changed. And now Europe is completely different, in terms of security and peace.The Far East -- I just mentioned the Japanese example. And that's what the enemyunderstands, and that's why they're so brutal and relentless. They understand the march ofpeace will be contagious. Part of my decision-making process is my firm belief in the naturalrights of men and women; my belief that deep in everybody's soul is the desire to live free. Ibelieve there's an Almighty, and I believe the Almighty's great gift to each man and woman inthis world is the desire to be free. This isn't America's gift to the world, it is a universal gift tothe world, and people want to be free.And if you believe that, and if you believe freedom yields the peace, it's important for theUnited States of America, with friends, to lead the cause of liberty. I'm not saying to anycountry, you must have a democracy that looks like America. I am saying, free your people,understand that liberty is universal, and help lay that foundation of peace for generations tocome. Some day an American President will be sitting down with elected leaders from acountry like Iraq talking about how to keep the peace. This generation is rising to thechallenge. We're looking at history, we understand our values, and we're laying thatfoundation of peace for generations to come.We've also got to be diligent here at home. I'm getting ready to answer some questions.Laura said, whatever you do, don't get too windy.We've created the Department of Homeland Security. We reorganized our intelligenceservices. I want you to know that every morning, I meet with the Director of NationalIntelligence or his Deputy, sometimes with the head of the CIA, and always with a briefer, CIAbriefer that comes and gives me the latest intelligence and the analysis of intelligence. That'severy morning in the White House, except for Sunday. And the reason I do is because I told you early that my job is not to be complacent, my job isto be on the lookout -- along with a lot of other people, I want you to know. We've got800,000 state and first responders that have been trained; security is strong at the airports. Ihope they stop taking off the shoes of the elderly. I must confess, they haven't taken off myshoes lately at the airport.We're doing a lot of stuff, but I want to talk about two tools necessary to protect you. First,before September the 11th, our law enforcement and intelligence services weren't able toshare information. For example, within the FBI, you had your law enforcement division andyour intelligence division -- and for a lot of reasons, if they had information about a potentialterrorist, they couldn't share it. That's hard to fathom, but it's the truth. There was a wall builtup, and there's a lot of reasons why the wall was built up -- some of it historical, obviously,legal ramifications.And I didn't think you could ask our front-line officers to defend us if they didn't have all thetools necessary to share intelligence, and to share information -- by the way, tools which havebeen granted to use in tracking down drug dealers, for example. My attitude was, if it's goodenough -- these tools are good enough to find a drug dealer, then they ought to be goodenough to protect us from the new threats of the 21st century.And so the Congress passed what's called the Patriot Act by a huge majority. They saw thethreat, and they said, wait a minute, let's make sure that if we ask the administration, and,more importantly, people in the administration to defend us, let's give them the toolsnecessary to defend us. Interestingly enough, the Patriot Act, some of its provisions are set toexpire. I like to remind people the Patriot Act may be set to expire, but the threats to theUnited States haven't expired. And exactly what has changed, I asked out loud, after theattack of September the 11th and today? Those tools are still needed for our law enforcementofficers. I want you to know that this Patriot Act is under constant review, and there has beenno documented abuses under the Patriot Act.In other words, Congress, in its wisdom, when it passed the Act, said, we'll make sure thatthe civil liberties of the United States are protected as we give the tools to those who areasked to take the fight to the enemy, to protect us. Congress extended this Patriot Act toFebruary 3rd. That's not good enough for the American people, it seems like to me. Whenthey get back there, they need to make sure they extend all aspects of the Patriot Act toprotect the American people. The threat still exists, is my message to members of both political parties. The tools -- if theywere important right after September the 11th, they're still important in 2006. The enemy hasnot gone away.Let me talk about one other program -- and then I promise to answer questions -- somethingthat you've been reading about in the news lately. It's what I would call a ""terroristsurveillance program."" After the enemy attacked us, and after I realized that we were notprotected by oceans, I asked people that work for you -- work for me, how best can we useinformation to protect the American people? You might remember there was hijackers herethat had made calls outside the country to somebody else, prior to the September the 11thattacks. And I said, is there anything more we can do within the law, within the Constitution,to protect the American people. And they came back with a program, designed a program thatI want to describe to you. And I want people here to clearly understand why I made thedecision I made.First, I made the decision to do the following things because there's an enemy that still wantsto harm the American people. What I'm talking about is the intercept of certaincommunications emanating between somebody inside the United States and outside theUnited States; and one of the numbers would be reasonably suspected to be an al Qaeda linkor affiliate. In other words, we have ways to determine whether or not someone can be an alQaeda affiliate or al Qaeda. And if they're making a phone call in the United States, it seemslike to me we want to know why.This is a -- I repeat to you, even though you hear words, ""domestic spying,"" these are notphone calls within the United States. It's a phone call of an al Qaeda, known al Qaeda suspect,making a phone call into the United States. I'm mindful of your civil liberties, and so I had allkinds of lawyers review the process.We briefed members of the United States Congress, one of whom was Senator Pat Roberts,about this program. You know, it's amazing, when people say to me, well, he was justbreaking the law -- if I wanted to break the law, why was I briefing Congress?Federal courts have consistently ruled that a President has authority under the Constitution toconduct foreign intelligence surveillance against our enemies. Predecessors of mine have usedthat same constitutional authority. Recently there was a Supreme Court case called the Hamdicase. It ruled the authorization for the use of military force passed by the Congress in 2001 --in other words, Congress passed this piece of legislation. And the Court ruled, the SupremeCourt ruled that it gave the President additional authority to use what it called ""thefundamental incidents of waging war"" against al Qaeda. I'm not a lawyer, but I can tell you what it means. It means Congress gave me the authorityto use necessary force to protect the American people, but it didn't prescribe the tactics. It'san -- you've got the power to protect us, but we're not going to tell you how. And one of theways to protect the American people is to understand the intentions of the enemy. I told youit's a different kind of war with a different kind of enemy. If they're making phone calls intothe United States, we need to know why -- to protect you.And that's the world in which you live. I view it as a chance for an historic opportunity tomake this place better for your children and your grandchildren -- ""this place"" being the world.I'm just confident that if we don't lose our will, and stay strong, and that as that libertyadvances, people may look back at this lecture and other speeches by people who profess thesame devotion to freedom that I've had, and say, you know, maybe they're just right. MaybeAmerica, that was founded on natural rights of men and women is a ticket for peace. Maybethat kind of view -- that every person matters, that there are such things as human dignityand the basic freedoms that we feel, that becomes a huge catalyst for change for the better. These troops are defending you with all their might, but at the same time, they're beginningto help change that world by spreading liberty and freedom. It's such an honor to be the President of the great country that we are during such historictimes, and I want to thank you for giving me a chance to describe to you some of thedecision-making processes I've used to do my duty to defend the American people.God bless.Be glad to answer some questions if you've got some. Thank you. I think there's some peoplewith microphones and all that, that are going to be out there. Anybody has any questions, anyboys from the Last Chance Bar got any questions? Question: Mr. President. President Bush: Thank you, yes. Yes, ma'am. Question: Mr. President, we salute what you have done, your aggressive stance on terrorism.But more than that, as you know, Kansas is a beef state. The number one industry in thestate of Kansas is beef production and beef processing. A strong beef industry indicates astrong Kansas, and it affects all of us. We sincerely appreciate your efforts in regaining ourmarkets with Japan, your aggressive stance on trade. We support that tremendously. Iwonder if you would just comment on what's happened recently. President Bush: Yes, well, thanks. Thank you for your leadership. We think we grow prettygood beef in Texas, too. Now is not the time to compare, of course.Look, here's the thing. There's an interesting debate in the United States about markets,about whether or not we should aggressively seek markets or whether or not we shouldbecome protectionists. Protectionism means tariffs and policies that make it difficult for peopleto trade in the United States and for people in the United States to trade outside the UnitedStates. I'm a big believer in opening markets. There's a practical reason why. One is that,we're 5 percent of the people, which means -- in the world -- that means 95 percent of thepeople are potential customers for U.S. farmers and ranchers and small businesses andentrepreneurs. And so, what Madam President -- former President is referring to is that I havebeen very aggressive about opening up markets through trade agreements.Yet I'm a little concerned about trade agreements, though, because it's more and moredifficult to get them passed out of the United States Congress. It seems like they're becomingso political that people either are becoming protectionist or lose sight -- are losing sight of thevalue about opening markets. Look, if you're a cattle raiser in Kansas, you want to be able to sell your product in Japan orSouth Korea or China. I mean, people want the beef. And the problem we've recently had, asyou mentioned, reflects what is necessary to make sure that trade works. And that is, if thereare problems, like in this case, some beef coming out of Brooklyn, I think it was, and if theJapanese balk at opening their markets, we have got to be aggressive about explaining topeople why our beef is safe. And so part of being -- part of making sure that the ranchers inthis case see the benefits of open markets is when a market gets open, to work hard to makesure that market stays open if there happens to be a problem -- or a short-term problem. Secondly, is to make sure that we're treated fairly. And that part -- when you see me arguingfor trade agreements, a lot of times it means that a country is getting a better deal from usthan we are from them. All I'm saying is, look, just treat us the way we treat you. If we openup our markets for your product, you open your markets for our products. And so my -- and I believe, and this is going to sound -- let me just say to people as youstudy the economics of how to make sure this economy continues to grow, one way to do it isto make sure the markets are available, that there be a level playing field. I believe we cancompete with anybody, anytime, anywhere, so long as it's fair. And obviously one area where we're trying to keep those markets open is when it comes tobeef. And we had the BSE, and one of the jobs of the federal government is to respond quicklyto the BSE issue, is to try the settle people's nerves down so we can get those marketsreopened. And when I went to see Prime Minister Koizumi, as well as President Roh in SouthKorea, one of the items I discussed was, you're missing out on some Kansas beef.Question: Thank you, Mr. President. One of the things that most of our Senate delegationhas worked tirelessly on is the situation in the Sudan. Sudan was, of course, slated to be thechair of the African Union next year, which is -- they have tried, much like the United Nations,to do something. Does the United States have a larger role to play in the Sudan, and theentire sub-Saharan African region?President Bush: Yes, great question. We have played an active -- first of all, I do want tothank both Senators. I'm on treacherous ground here to kind of credit one versus the other,but I guess I will, since one of them is going to want a free meal going back to Washington. Iguess both. Sam, I mean -- Roberts is great on the issue, and Sam is the person I've beeninterfacing with the most, frankly, in the whole United States Senate, about his deep concernfor life in the Sudan. Matter of fact, in the vehicle driving over here, he brought the issue up. We have got an important role to play and have played it. I don't know if you remember theDanforth commission, where Jack Danforth, the former senator from Missouri, was my envoyto the Sudan to help resolve the north-south conflict. And there was a peace agreement inplace. And the peace agreement was set back, unfortunately, because -- well, it's still intact,don't get me wrong, but the implementation was delayed somewhat because of John Garang'suntimely death. He was the leader of the south of Sudan. So the important thing there is thatwe showed through diplomacy that it's possible to resolve differences, and to begin to reducethe abhorrent issue of slavery. As you now know, the issue in Sudan is -- and by the way, one of the great strengths of thiscountry is our faith-based programs that rose up in indignation about the slavery that wastaking place in the Sudan. Much of the first wave of help that went into the Sudan, some of itwas government, most of it was the response of the private sector, particularly the religiouscommunities. The issue now is Darfur. And when Colin was still the Secretary of State, he declared thepolicy of the U.S. and our deep concern that we are headed toward genocide. I think we're theonly nation that has uttered those words thus far in Darfur. The strategy -- and it's a verycomplex situation. It would take yet another lecture to give you all the kind of ins and outs.But suffice it to say that we are deeply concerned about poor folks who have been run out oftheir villages into refugee camps, who are still being threatened by a jinjaweed militia andsome rebellious groups that are trying to extract political gain through marauding and deathand rape and destruction. We've empowered the AU, and this is what your question really kind of -- part of yourquestion leads to -- to provide forces on the ground, to provide stability. And what he'sreferring to is that the Sudanese government is going to be the head of the African Union --that's what AU stands for -- which would then put them the titular head of the troops on the ground. And, obviously, that should be of concern -- concern to us. It is a concern to us, andit should be a concern to the AU nations. That issue has yet to be resolved as to whether or not Sudan will be the AU. This is animportant issue. We will continue to work with Congress to provide aid, food aid and help. Wehelped fly the AU troops into Sudan. We're watching it very carefully. We are consideringdifferent strategies as to how to make sure that there's enough protection at least to getpeople help and protection, and, at the same time, see if we can't try to broker the same kindof agreement we did north-south, with the Darfur and the government. Thank you for askingthe question. Yes, sir. Question: What is your position, or would you comment on a long-term strategy with respectto the geopolitical ambitions of China and Iran? President Bush: Yes, great question. First, let me start with Iran. I'm deeply concernedabout Iran, as should a lot of people be concerned about Iran. I'm concerned, when thecountry of Iran, their president announces his desire to see that Israel gets destroyed. Israelis our ally. We're committed to the safety of Israel, and it's a commitment we will keep. Secondly, I'm concerned about a non-transparent society's desire to develop a nuclearweapon. The world cannot be put in a position where we can be blackmailed by a nuclearweapon. I believe it is very important for the Iranian government to hear loud and clear fromnot only the United States, but also from other nations around the world. I also want theIranian people to hear loud and clear, and that is, we have no beef with you. We are worriedabout a government that is not transparent whose aims and objectives are not peaceful. And,therefore, we don't think that you should have the capacity to make a nuclear weapon. The diplomatic strategy is being led right now by what's called the EU3 -- France, Germanyand Great Britain -- and they're doing a good job of keeping together a common message tosay to the Iranians that we expect you to adhere to international norm. The next logical step ifthe Iranians continue not to adhere to international norm or the demands of the free world isto go to the United Nations Security Council.At the same time, the development of an Iraqi democracy is an important message to peopleinside of Iran. I told you what I believe. I believe everybody desires to be free. I believewomen want to be treated equally. And I think that a message of democracy and freedom inthat part of the world will embolden reformers. But this is a serious issue. China is -- we have a complex relationship with China. Unlike with Iran, which we sanctioneda long time ago, we've got a lot of relations with China. We've got trade relations with China.We have got diplomatic relations with China. I've met with the Chinese leadership quite often,and will tell you my personal relations with Hu Jintao are warm, warm enough to be able to sitwith him in private and talk about things that matter to me. And one thing that matters to meis the freedom of the Chinese people. I think any time in the diplomatic arena, you want the President to be in a position where hecan have a relationship where you can speak with candor and your words can be heard, asopposed to a relationship that gets so tense and so off-putting because of distrust. Nobodylikes to be lectured in the public arena, let me put it to you that way. I don't like it, and I'msure other leaders don't like it. And so I've worked hard to make sure that my personaldiplomacy is such that I'm able to make certain points with the Chinese. One such point is that, you know, treat us the way we treat you. You've got a trade imbalancewith the United States. And if we don't get it under control, there could be a backlash here.And, therefore, we expect you to treat our products the same way we treat you. And by theway, if you happen to dump -- choose to dump products, like in textiles, we'll hold you toaccount under the law. I talk about their currency with the Chinese. You've got to let your currency float. The marketcurrency ought to be priced through market, not by government edict, which is -- they'rebeginning to move a little bit on the currency, if you're paying attention to the issue. Now, I went to church in China. And I was a little nervous, at first, frankly, about a licensedchurch. I wasn't sure whether or not I was going to go to a church or not a church, and went -- Laura and I went with a guy named Luis Palau. And I was impressed by the spirit I felt in thechurch.And after it was over, I told Hu Jintao, I said, you know, I'm a religious person, and the morefree religion is in your country, the better off your society will be, and you shouldn't fear thechurch. You ought to come to the church. You know, you ought to see what I saw, which ispeaceful people honoring something greater than themselves. I would hope that China will continue to move in the -- or move in the direction of humandignity. I talked to him about, of course, the Dalai Lama; talked to him about the CatholicChurch's inability to get their bishops in. In other words, what I do is I press the freedomissue. We don't always agree with China, of course. It's a complex relationship, but it's one inwhich, in my judgment, it's best to be in a position where we can dialogue and discuss thingsin order to keep relations on keel and keep peace in that part of the world.It's really interesting, do you realize that it takes China 25 million new jobs a year to stayeven. Think about that -- I'm out there blowing when we get 4 million in the past -- since Aprilof 2003 -- this guy needs to get 25 million a year.  And Sam and I and Pat, and the Governorwere talking about the Chinese demand for energy. One reason they've got such a hugedemand for energy is because they've got to grow their economy, 25 million people a year.And their economy is just beginning to modernize, so they're using a lot of raw materials. I'mkind of wandering here, but -- which says two things to me, by the way -- it's called afilibuster -- it says we've got to diversify away from hydrocarbons in the United States ofAmerica.When we were driving through the beautiful country coming here, I told the Governor and Itold the two senators I firmly believe a day is coming when we're going to be able to growsaw grass and convert that into energy. And, secondly, we've got to share technology withChina so that they become better users of energy and better protectors of the environment.It's a complex relationship that we spend a lot of time thinking about. And I appreciate yourquestion very much. Hu Jintao is coming, I think, here pretty soon to the United States. Andas I say, I enjoy my visits -- personal visits with him. Yes, ma'am. Question: Hello, Mr. President. I am an American Iraqi Kurd. I would like to salute you andsalute all the troops are freeing 27 million people. They are free.President Bush: Thank you. Question: Mr. President, I would like to share this thought with all our nation and everybodywho is questioning what happened to the chemical weapons. Saddam burned 4,500 villagers.I lost more than 10 members of my family under the ground. We found their bones after,when we freed Iraq. Saddam, himself, and his people, his followers, they are chemicalweapons. Please stop questioning the administration and their decision. It was the bestdecision anybody could take. Freeing 27 million people.President Bush: Okay, this is a question and answer period. Question: Mr. President -- President Bush: I hate to cut you off. You're on a roll, but what's the question? Question: Mr. President, all I could tell you, I have two members of my family, they are inthe Iraqi parliament. And both of them are women. My sister-in-law and my aunt, they are inthe Iraqi parliament. And I would like you to share this happiness with me and with all theIraqi people. Thank you, Mr. President.President Bush: Thank you. And here's my message -- here's my message to your relativesin the Iraqi parliament: Work to form a unity government, a government that includes theminorities in the country -- a Shia, Kurd, and Sunni -- no, no, no -- no, no. Thank you --laughter.Question: My husband is Sunni. My mother-in-law was a Christian, Catholic -- President Bush: All right --Question: I have two kids -- President Bush: Thank you. Got a question? Only in America. Hold on.Question: I'm from the United Kingdom. President Bush: Welcome.Question: Thank you. Although I might be living here for a while now, and you haven't kickedme out, and I thank you very much for that -- President Bush: Write your senator. Anyway, go ahead. Question: Us British, were a querulous people and we know that we're one of your greatestsupporters in the world, and Tony Blair, who I have the greatest respect for, is my leader.When you say, ""jump,"" he says, ""how high?"" At least, that's the perception of many of theBritish people. And when he agrees and does your bidding, then it weakens him on the homefront at home. And many people enjoy this, but some of the more vocal ones will say, he's ayes-man. Have you discussed that with him, and do you have any -- President Bush: I appreciate that a lot. First, I'm aware that that is a criticism of Tony, and Ijust strongly disagree with that. Frankly, it's demeaning to his character and his strength ofconviction. But I've heard the criticism, and it's just simply not the case. Like you, I admire him a lot. He's an independent thinker. He and I share this interestingmoment in history together, and we also share this deep belief that liberty will transform theworld -- it can transform the world. That's what we believe. In other words, there is aphilosophical core of Tony Blair that I -- belief, core beliefs that Tony and I share. You know, sometimes we disagree on tactics. We try to work through what we -- we've had alot of disagreements. I mean, a classic came on the Kyoto treaty. You might remember thetreaty. I said I just wasn't going to support it. I didn't think it was good for the Americaneconomy; I thought there was a better way to go about being good stewards of theenvironment. He disagreed with me. There's a series of issues where we -- internationalcriminal court is another good example. I think the international criminal court is somethingwe shouldn't join. I just don't want unelected prosecutors prosecuting our troops or ourdiplomats in a court overseas. Tony disagreed strongly. I can give you a series of examples where -- but we agree strategically. And that's what'simportant. Look, I'm sorry that his relationship with me causes him political problems athome. Sometimes I can be a little allergic for people overseas, if you know what I mean.  ButI think I would classify our relationship as historic.You don't know this -- I'm about to tell you something interesting -- that we talk once a week,or try to. And it's a really interesting way to share just thoughts and concerns. And theBritish-U.S. relationship is unique. It's been unique in the past, it is unique today, and I'mconvinced it will be unique in the future, for the good of the world. But, no, I'm very aware of the political difficulties he's faced. By the way, when you makehard decisions, like Tony has made, and, frankly, I've made, it creates angst. I mean, theeasy route would have been to do nothing and just hope for the best. And that's why I admireTony. Tony is a person of great courage. I can remember -- I'll tell you an anecdote -- you didn't even ask, and I'm going to tell you.And it's been published in a book a guy wrote in Washington. Tony was very worried about hisgovernment. You might remember when the second resolution -- we had the first resolution;then there was an argument about what ""serious consequences"" meant -- I guess that's whatthe problem was. I kind of knew what it meant. He knew what it meant. Others, all of asudden, had a different view of ""serious consequences"" when Saddam chose to not dealsquarely with the world and not deal with the inspectors. He was worried about hisgovernment, and so was I. And I told him one time, I said, if you're worried about yourgovernment -- I said, you don't want your government to fall, and if you're worried about it,just go ahead and pull out of the coalition, so you can save your government. And he said to me, he said, I'm going to -- he said, I have made my commitment on behalf ofthe great country of Britain, and I'm not changing my mind. Basically, what he told me, hesaid, George, he said, politics -- I'm not interested in politics; what I'm interested in is doingthe right thing. And that's why I admire Tony Blair; he'll do the right thing.Good question. Yes, sir. Question: I have a question less with politics and more with leadership, in general. You're ina situation where you're under a lot of flack, especially for your character. And that'ssomething that, it seems to me, means a lot to you, as it does to many of us here. As aleader, as many of us are going to need to know here because we're going to be leaders injust a few years, what's the best way that you go about preparing yourself for attacks on yourcharacter, and how do you deal with others in those matters?President Bush: Yes, I appreciate that. I would summarize it: faith, family and friends. I amsustained mightily by the fact that millions of citizens -- for whom I'll never get to thankpersonally -- pray for me. It's hard for me to describe why I feel that way, why I'm sosustained. I guess it's just called faith. And I'm sustained by my family. And there's nothingbetter than going home to somebody who understands and is sympathetic and is part of --we're working together. I mean, Laura's job is just as important as mine in many ways. The girls still love me. I really love them. And then there's my man, Barney, a little Scottishterrier.  I say this -- and Laura will be furious at me -- he's the son I never had, you know?I believe in what I'm doing. And I understand politics, and it can get rough. I read a lot ofhistory, by the way, and Abraham Lincoln had it rough. I'm not comparing myself to AbrahamLincoln, nor should you think just because I mentioned his name in the context of mypresidency -- I would never do that. He was a great President. But, boy, they mistreated him.He did what he thought was right. A lot of politicians, a lot of Presidents have gone through some tough times in the presidency,and I understand that. One of my biggest disappointments is the tone in Washington, D.C.I've done my best to try to elevate the tone. I just -- needless name-calling, to me, is beneaththe dignity of the office of the President. I also make time in my day not only for prayer, butalso -- and my family, but also for exercise. I found that part of keeping a positive outlook isto kind of burn off that excess energy, you know what I'm saying? I work out, I try to workout five or six days a week. It's really important -- if you feel that's important for your life, toschedule your life. In other words, I have trouble with people saying, I'm so busy I can'texercise. I don't think you're too busy for things that are important in your life, and you canfigure out ways to make time in your life. And so I'm the kind of guy -- I'm not running too well these days; I'm not running hardly atall. It's kind of like my knees are like tires, you know, and they're bald. I'm a mountain bikeguy. And it's a fantastic experience. I think to answer your -- summarize your question, is to make sure that you've got goodpriorities in your life. By having good priorities in your life, it helps you keep perspective onyour life. And perspective is very important, as you assume responsibility. Thanks for thequestion.Yes, ma'am. Question: Mr. President, thank you for being here. I served under your father, he was myCommander-in-Chief in Desert Storm. And it was with great interest that I followed yourcampaign; my husband and I both are great fans of yours. I thank you for making the harddecisions, for making -- not listening to the critics and keeping your campaign promise. And I've been following the confirmation hearings of Judge Alito. And I certainly hope he'sconfirmed. President Bush: Well, I appreciate that. Question: But I'd like to kind of know how it stands right now. President Bush: Yes, what's happening? First of all, I told the people -- and thank you foryour kind comments -- and I told the people when I ran for President I would put people onthe bench who would strictly interpret the Constitution. In other words, not use their positionto write law. We've got legislators to write law; that's their job. The judges are to interpretlaw.And Sam has been one of the picks I made for the Supreme Court, Sam Alito. He's a very,very smart, capable man. When you talk to Sam Alito, you think, smart judge. He's written alot of opinions. He has a judicial philosophy that is clear and a judicial temperament that issound. That's why the American Bar Association gave him the highest possible rating. Andnow the question is, will Sam Alito be given an up or down vote on the Senate floor. I don't know whether or not in our history there's ever been a filibuster of a Supreme Courtjudge. One years ago -- Sam, by the way, is on the Judiciary Committee and helps conductthe hearings in a way that I thought has brought dignity to the process.And so to answer your question, I don't know. You hear gossip about a filibuster, meaning aminority of Democrats --senators could stop Alito from getting a vote. It would really -- Ididn't mean to slip, I'm not trying to be -- I'm not taking political shots. It just so happensthat it would be the Democrats who would try to not give him an up or down vote on theSenate floor.I think he deserves an up or down vote. I believe that if given an up or down vote, he'll beconfirmed and the decision-making -- you know, we're in the process now of hearing from theDemocrat leadership. There are 14 senators, seven from both political parties, who have vowed to try to prevent afilibuster from taking place without extraordinary circumstances. In other words, if there isextraordinary circumstance, they would agree to a filibuster. There has been no sign of anyextraordinary circumstance, except for this extraordinary thing -- he's extraordinarily capableto serve on the Supreme Court. And so thank you for your question on Sam. It's going tocome to a head here pretty soon. I think the vote in the committee is -- Wednesday is thevote in the Judiciary? Tomorrow, yes. You don't have to worry about it in the Committee. Thefloor will proffer it later this week. That's great. Okay, a couple more and then I've got to head back home. Yes, ma'am. Question: Hi. First I'd like to say that when I was first able to cast my vote for President, itwas my honor to vote for you -- [inaudible]. Can you hear me? President Bush: I like that part.Question: My question is about Social Security. President Bush: Social Security? Question: Yes. [Inaudible]. President Bush: I couldn't hear the question, so I'll put the words in your mouth. I guessyou asked is the system going to be viable when you get -- yes? No.If I were you, I'd pay attention to the issue. And the reason why is because there's a lot of usgetting ready to retire. There's a baby boomer bulge. I was born in '46, on the leading edge ofwhat we call the baby boomers, and there's a lot of us getting ready to retire, which meansyou are going to have to pay for a lot more people in the system, plus we've been promisedgreater benefits than the previous generation. So the system is going to go broke unless wedo something about it.Last year I talked about doing something about it, and the Congress didn't do anything aboutit. So this year I'm going to talk about doing something about it, and the next year somethingabout it, and the next year something about it. I have a duty to confront problems and nothope, you know, just kind of shuffle them along. And so this is a big issue; both Medicare andSocial Security are big issues. They're big issues for long-term deficits, and they're big issuesfor the individuals who are going to be having to pay in the system for people like me. Andthe fix isn't all that hard. What is first required is people setting aside needless politics in Washington, D.C. and saying,why don't we come together and get something done for the sake of a future generation. Andwe can make sure that this generation -- that the up-and-coming generation -- see, nothingchanges if you're over 55. It's the young people paying into a broke system. By the way, theycall it a Social Security trust, there's no ""trust."" The money is paid and it's spent on otherprograms, and all that's left in the Social Security is an IOU. And so it seems like to me thatit's really important to kind of lay out all the facts on the table for people to determinewhether or not there's a problem or not. And once they see a problem, then they ought to becalling on people on the phone, their elected representatives, saying, do something about it. And I believe we can fix this problem by slowing down the rate of growth of benefits, notcutting benefits. Benefits will increase. But the promises have been just too great, and weneed to be frank about it. We need to be open about it to make sure that we save the SocialSecurity system for our younger generation. I also happen to believe we have a fantastic opportunity to promote ownership in America. Ibelieve younger workers ought to be able to take some of their own money and set it aside ina personal savings account. And the reason I believe that is I think if you own an asset, ithelps provide stability in American society. I'm concerned that -- I'm concerned at the lowrate of return people get on their money through the Social Security -- you know, supposedSocial Security trust. I know the power of compounding rate of interest. For those of youstudying in economics, look it up. It says money grows exponentially over time. And if you putyour money in just a safe series of instruments, it will grow. If you start saving at age 20, itgrows quite dramatically over time, and then that's your nest egg. It's what you call -- it's apart of a Social Security benefit system. Again, those of us who retire -- and I'm not talkingabout you, I'm talking about younger workers being given an option.I'm also concerned about people in our society who've never owned anything. You know, I'mworried about -- and I know that if you own -- can you imagine a single mom working andable to put some of the money aside for herself if she wants, and watch that grow with justsafe investments over time, and when she retires, she's got a nest egg that she calls her own,that government can't spend on another program, a nest egg that she can pass on to herloved one. I mean, ownership and the ability to pass wealth from one generation to the next is animportant part of busting the cycle of poverty, for example. And so this is a great opportunityto think differently about this very important program. And I appreciate you bringing it up,and thanks for being concerned about it. You need to be. Yes, ma'am. Question: ([Inaudible]. President Bush: Do what? Question: [Inaudible]. President Bush: Yes, I'll look at it. Thank you. Appreciate it. Is your return address on thereso I can write you back? No? Okay. Make sure I get that. Question: Hi, I just want to get your comments about education. Recently, $12.7 billion wascut from education, and I was just wondering how that's supposed to help our futures?President Bush: Education budget was cut -- say it again. What was cut? Question: Twelve point seven billion dollars was cut from education, and I was justwondering how is that supposed to help our -- President Bush: At the federal level? Question: Yes.President Bush: I don't think that -- I don't think we've actually -- for higher education?Student loans? Question: Yes, student loans. President Bush: Actually, I think what we did was reform the student loan program. We'renot cutting money out of it. In other words, people aren't going to be cut off the program.We're just making sure it works better. Part of the reconciliation package, I think she's talkingabout. Yes, it's a reform of the program to make sure it functions better. It is -- in otherwords, we're not taking people off student loans, we're saving money in the student loanprogram because it's inefficient. And so I think the thing to look at is whether or not there willbe fewer people getting student loans. I don't think so. And, secondly, on Pell grants, we'reactually expanding the number of Pell grants through our budget. But, great question. I think that the key on education is to make sure that we stay focused onhow do we stay competitive into the 21st century. And I plan on doing some talking aboutmath and science and engineering programs, so that people who graduate out of college willhave the skills necessary to compete in this competitive world. But I'm -- I think I'm right on this. I'll check when I get back to Washington. But thank youfor your question.Yes, ma'am. Question: Again, I just wanted to thank you for coming. Your speech was very good. I'm abig admirer of your wife. I know that you said that your role as a President was as a decision-maker, and I would like you to comment, please, on how your wife contributes to yourdecision-making process, and how you confide in her. Thank you. President Bush: Yes, thanks. She's great. She keeps -- she tells me when I'm out of line.First of all, Laura pays attention to what's going on. And so she offers her advice. And it'ssound advice. She's a West Texas woman, born and raised in West Texas. Kind of a -- I wouldsay she brings common sense. Kind of remind people from here -- reminds me of people herefrom Kansas -- down-to-earth, no airs, common-sense point of view.And so I appreciate very much when she does give me her advice, which can be too frequentsometimes.  Not true, honey.It's like the time -- she tells the story about the time when I was running for Congress in 1978in West Texas, and she criticized one of my speeches. And I ran into the garage door. But thebest -- I guess the best way to describe it is, one, I value her judgment, and I know it comesfrom her heart. And I appreciate the perspective she brings. Common sense is just a veryimportant part of being a decision-maker. There is something reassuring to me when I getadvice from somebody who's got the best interests in mind, got my best interest in mind, aswell as just this kind of down-to-earth read on the situation. And that's how I view my advicefrom Laura. Plus, she does -- I mean, I said some things -- ""wanted dead or alive"" -- and she said, youmight be able to explain that a little -- express yourself a little better than that, George W.And so we've got a great relationship. You know, when I married her, she really didn't likepolitics, didn't care particularly for politicians either. And here she is the First Lady of theUnited States. And she is good. Boy, I tell you, she's -- when she speaks, she's very crediblebecause she's a decent, credible person. And I love her a lot.Yes. Is that a Washington National hat? Question: Wisconsin, actually. President Bush: Okay, yes. Question: W is for Wisconsin. You're a rancher. A lot of us here in Kansas are ranchers. I wasjust wanting to get your opinion on ""Brokeback Mountain,"" if you've seen it yet? You wouldlove it. You should check it out. President Bush: I haven't seen it. I'll be glad to talk about ranching, but I haven't seen themovie. I've heard about it. I hope you go -- you know -- I hope you go back to the ranch andthe farm is what I'm about to say. I haven't seen it.Question: Mr. President, I have a question about the nuclear weapons the United States iskeeping. It's around 3,000 nuclear weapons, so I want to know your opinion when you aregoing to destroy them?President Bush: Do what, now? I didn't hear what you said. Question: When you are going to -- President Bush: I can't hear you very well. I'm sorry, I'm not trying to avoid the question, Ijust didn't get it. Question: United States has 3,000 nuclear weapons. President Bush: Three thousand nuclear weapons. Question: Yes. And I want to know your opinion about these weapons of mass destruction,that when the United States is going to destroy the nuclear weapons to prevail the peace inthe world. President Bush: Got it. No, I appreciate it. One of the first things I did as the President wasto negotiate a reduction of nuclear -- deployable nuclear weapons with Vladimir Putin.Actually, I think we had 6,000 at the time, and we agreed to reduce our nuclear -- deployablenuclear arsenals to between 1,700 and 2,200. And we're in the process of doing that now. Andthen of course, there will be -- another President can then evaluate where we are. So we're inthe process of honoring what's called the Moscow Treaty. A couple of more and then I've got to hop. Yes, ma'am. Question: Mr. President -- [speaking Spanish.] I know that the relationship between UnitedStates and Venezuela is no good. That's not my problem. My problem is -- or the question Ihave for you is what are you doing in the borders? We try to secure the United States forterrorism, I know. So we're trying to secure the borders, but, as well, some of us of who areHispanics and professional sometimes are denied the opportunity to work and advance in theworkplace because we are minorities. What are you going to do as a [inaudible] -- what are you going to do provide the most securejob in which we serve the country, we serve the university? I can't complain in this university,I've been treated like royalty here, but when you work outside the university as a Hispanic,you are not look good enough because they think you come from Mexico.I come from Venezuela, which is a different country, but all of us are Hispanics and all of usembrace ourselves in America because America is -- North America, the United States. InCentral and South America, where one continents embrace each other. So what are you goingto do to provide opportunities for the Hispanics who come to this country legally, like I did? Orwho are illegal here? We should help them to get legal here, not provide directly a green card,but help them to become legal in step-by-step -- President Bush: Okay. Question: -- like all of us have done. Thank you. President Bush: Yes, I got the question. Immigration.First of all, bienvenidos. And we have an obligation in this country to enforce our borders. Andthere's huge pressure on our borders. We've got a long border, obviously, with Mexico, and along border with Canada. And the biggest, most problematic area right now is the border withMexico -- California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. The issue is not only Mexican citizens who are coming across the border illegally, but it's othercitizens who are coming across the border. And our obligation is to use a wise strategy to shutdown the trafficking of anything illegal across the border. We're a country of law, and we mustenforce the border. And we spend a lot of time in Washington, D.C. analyzing the borderissues, and strategizing with Congress about how to do a better job including the followingthings: One, increasing the number of Border Patrol agents; two, increasing the use oftechnology on the border, so that you can see people coming through drones, for example,and then be able to rally the Border Patrol to stop people from coming across. Some physical barriers, particularly in urban centers, are now being constructed. Some berms-- there's parts of our border, where, literally, you can just drive across and there's nothing.You know, it's just nothing -- land, and in you come. And it's hard -- the demarcation zone isdifferent, and it makes it hard for people to enforce the border. Secondly, when we detain somebody at the border, we've got to have a rational policy to helpback up the people we're paying to enforce the border.And by that I mean if you're somebody from Central America, for example, caught cominginto our country that the policy has been to give you a notification to report back to a judge,and they'll hear your case. Well, guess what? A lot of them don't come back. They're herebecause they're trying to better their lives, and they're going to move into our society as bestas they can. And they're not going to return back. So we're ending what's called ""catch andrelease,"" and we're beginning to provide more detention space for our Border Patrol to be ableto say to people -- particularly from Central America and South America -- you've comeillegally, we're sending you back home. Thirdly, in terms of workers. We do have H1, H2B visa programs that we're constantlyanalyzing with the United States Congress. It makes sense that highly skilled workers, forexample, be given work permits here in the United States if it helps us meet an economicobjective. But I feel strongly that we need to take the worker program a step further, and I'lltell you why. I'm mindful that most people come here to work. There are a lot of people inyour state dependent upon people coming here to work. I tell you I used to say that -- when I was governor of Texas, family values didn't stop at theRio Grande River. And people if they could make 50 cents and had mouths to feed or $5 andhad mouths to feed, a lot of people would come to try find that $5 work. And so here's myposition, and that is that if there is someone who will do a job an American won't do, thenthat person ought to be given a temporary worker card to work in the United States for a setperiod of time. I do not believe that any guest worker program ought to contain amnesty, because I believethat if you granted amnesty to the people here working now that that would cause another 8million people or so to come here. I do believe, however, it is humane to say to a person,you're doing a job somebody else won't do, here is a temporary card to enable you to do thecard [sic]. The length of stay here will be dependent upon the actions of the Congress. It's conceivableyou could have a three-year period with a renewal period. I've thought a lot about this issue, Ijust want you to know. And by the way, when you mention guest worker, a lot of peopleautomatically spring to amnesty, all I want to do is grant legal status. That's just not the case.I don't believe we ought to do that. But I do believe we ought to recognize there are peopledoing work others won't do.And there's a lot of good employers here in Kansas employing these people, and theemployers don't know whether or not somebody is here legally or not. Because what'shappened is a whole kind of industry has sprung up around people coming here. And it'sinhumane. It's inhumane for the people being trafficked into the United States, and it's notfair to employers who may be breaking the law. And here's what I mean -- you've got people being smuggled into the United States ofAmerica by these criminal networks. They're called coyotes -- coyotes. And they're bringingthem in, in the back of 18-wheelers, stuffing human beings to come and do work in Americathat Americans won't do -- in the back of 18-wheelers. You've got a whole forgery industry upand running, you know? And so these guys show up with documents that -- so the employersays, well, you look legal to me. They don't know whether they're legal or not legal. And I know that we've got a lot of our Border Patrol agents trying to catch people sneaking inthe country. And so it seems like to me that why don't we recognize reality, give peopleworkers cards on a temporary basis so somebody can come back and forth legally, withtamper-proof card that will enable an employer to know whether or not they're hiringsomebody who is illegal. And if we catch employers after that hiring somebody illegal, there'sgot to be a fine and a consequence. And so a compassionate way to enforce our border is to give people a temporary worker cardwithout granting amnesty. That's a long answer to a very important problem that is -- now isthe time for the United States to take it on squarely, in a humane way, that recognizes thesituation and deals with it in an up-front way. And I want to thank you for the question. Look, I've got dinner tonight. I'd like to be here for a longer period of time, but Laura isserving dinner for retiring Alan Greenspan and I better not be late, otherwise all that advice, itwill be kind of -- have a little different tone to it. I've really enjoyed being here. I want tothank you for your courtesy for having me. Thank you for supporting a great university inKansas State University. May God bless you all and may God continue to bless our country.Thank you very much.",bush
"and diplomatic corps, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens, today our nation lost abeloved, graceful, courageous woman who called America to its founding ideals and carried ona noble dream. Tonight we are comforted by the hope of a glad reunion with the husband whowas taken so long ago, and we are grateful for the good life of Coretta Scott King.Every time I'm invited to this rostrum, I am humbled by the privilege and mindful of thehistory we have seen together. We have gathered under this Capitol dome in moments ofnational mourning and national achievement. We have served America through one of themost consequential periods of our history. And it has been my honor to serve with you.In a system of two parties, two chambers and two elected branches, there will always bedifferences and debate. But even tough debates can be conducted in a civil tone. And ourdifferences cannot be allowed to harden into anger. To confront the great issues before us, wemust act in a spirit of good will and respect for one another. And I will do my part. And I willdo my part.Tonight the state of our Union is strong, and together we will make it stronger. In this decisiveyear, you and I will make choices that determine both the future and the character of ourcountry. We will choose to act confidently in pursuing the enemies of freedom or retreat fromour duties in the hope of an easier life. We will choose to build our prosperity by leading theworld economy or shut ourselves off from trade and opportunity.In a complex and challenging time, the road of isolationism and protectionism may seembroad and inviting, yet it ends in danger and decline. The only way to protect our people, theonly way to secure the peace, the only way to control our destiny is by our leadership. So theUnited States of America will continue to lead.Abroad, our nation is committed to an historic, long-term goal: We seek the end of tyranny inour world. Some dismiss that goal as misguided idealism. In reality, the future security ofAmerica depends on it. On September the 11th, 2001, we found that problems originating in afailed and oppressive state 7,000 miles away could bring murder and destruction to ourcountry. Dictatorships shelter terrorists, and feed resentment and radicalism, and seekweapons of mass destruction. Democracies replace resentment with hope, respect the rightsof their citizens and their neighbors, and join the fight against terror. Every step towardfreedom in the world makes our country safer, and so we will act boldly in freedom's cause.Far from being a hopeless dream, the advance of freedom is the great story of our time. In1945, there were about two dozen lonely democracies in the world. Today there are 122. Andwe are writing a new chapter in the story of self-government, with women lining up to vote inAfghanistan, and millions of Iraqis marking their liberty with purple ink, and men and womenfrom Lebanon to Egypt debating the rights of individuals and the necessity of freedom.At the start of 2006, more than half the people of our world live in democratic nations. And wedo not forget the other half -- in places like Syria and Burma, Zimbabwe, North Korea andIran -- because the demands of justice and the peace of this world require their freedom aswell.No one can deny the success of freedom, but some men rage and fight against it. And one ofthe main sources of reaction and opposition is radical Islam; the perversion by a few of anoble faith into an ideology of terror and death.Terrorists like bin Laden are serious about mass murder and all of us must take their declaredintentions seriously. They seek to impose a heartless system of totalitarian control throughoutthe Middle East and arm themselves with weapons of mass murder.Their aim is to seize power in Iraq and use it as a safe haven to launch attacks againstAmerica and the world. Lacking the military strength to challenge us directly, the terroristshave chosen the weapon of fear. When they murder children at a school in Beslan or blow upcommuters in London or behead a bound captive, the terrorists hope these horrors will breakour will, allowing the violent to inherit the Earth. But they have miscalculated. We love ourfreedom, and we will fight to keep it.In a time of testing, we cannot find security by abandoning our commitments and retreatingwithin our borders. If we were to leave these vicious attackers alone, they would not leave usalone. They would simply move the battlefield to our own shores. There is no peace in retreat.And there is no honor in retreat. By allowing radical Islam to work its will, by leaving anassaulted world to fend for itself, we would signal to all that we no longer believe in our ownideals or even in our own courage.But our enemies and our friends can be certain: The United States will not retreat from theworld, and we will never surrender to evil. America rejects the false comfort of isolationism.We are the nation that saved liberty in Europe, and liberated death camps, and helped raiseup democracies and faced down an evil empire.Once again, we accept the call of history to deliver the oppressed and move this world towardpeace. We remain on the offensive against terror networks. We have killed or captured manyof their leaders. And, for the others, their day will come. We remain on the offensive inAfghanistan, where a fine president and a national assembly are fighting terror while buildingthe institutions of a new democracy.We're on the offensive in Iraq, with a clear plan for victory. First, we are helping Iraqis buildan inclusive government, so that old resentments will be eased and the insurgency will bemarginalized. Second, we are continuing reconstruction efforts and helping the Iraqigovernment to fight corruption and build a modern economy, so all Iraqis can experience thebenefits of freedom.Third, we are striking terrorist targets while we train Iraqi forces that are increasingly capableof defeating the enemy. Iraqis are showing their courage every day, and we are proud to betheir allies in the cause of freedom.Our work in Iraq is difficult, because our enemy is brutal. But that brutality has not stoppedthe dramatic progress of a new democracy. In less than three years, the nation has gone fromdictatorship, to liberation, to sovereignty, to a constitution, to national elections. At the sametime, our coalition has been relentless in shutting off terrorist infiltration, clearing outinsurgent strongholds and turning over territory to Iraqi security forces. I am confident in ourplan for victory. I am confident in the will of the Iraqi people. I am confident in the skill andspirit of our military.Fellow citizens, we are in this fight to win, and we are winning. The road of victory is the roadthat will take our troops home. As we make progress on the ground and Iraqi forcesincreasingly take the lead, we should be able to further decrease our troop levels. But thosedecisions will be made by our military commanders, not by politicians in Washington, D.C. Ourcoalition has learned from our experience in Iraq. We have adjusted our military tactics andchanged our approach to reconstruction. Along the way, we have benefited from responsiblecriticism and counsel offered by members of Congress of both parties.In the coming year, I will continue to reach out and seek your good advice. Yet there is adifference between responsible criticism that aims for success and defeatism that refuses toacknowledge anything but failure. Hindsight alone is not wisdom. And second-guessing is nota strategy. With so much in the balance, those of us in public office have a duty to speak withcandor. A sudden withdrawal of our forces from Iraq would abandon our Iraqi allies to deathand prison, would put men like bin Laden and Zarqawi in charge of a strategic country andshow that a pledge from America means little.Members of Congress, however we feel about the decisions and debates of the past, ournation has only one option: We must keep our word, defeat our enemies and stand behind theAmerican military in its vital mission. Our men and women in uniform are making sacrificesand showing a sense of duty stronger than all fear. They know what it's like to fight house tohouse in a maze of streets, to wear heavy gear in the desert heat, to see a comrade killed bya roadside bomb.And those who know the costs also know the stakes. Marine Staff Sergeant Dan Clay waskilled last month fighting in Fabiani. He left behind a letter to his family, but his words couldjust as well be addressed to every American. Here is what Dan wrote: ""I know what honor is.It has been an honor to protect and serve all of you. I faced death with the secure knowledgethat you would not have to. ""Never falter. Don't hesitate to honor and support those of us whohad the honor of protecting that which is worth protecting."" Staff Sergeant Dan Clay's wife,Lisa, and his mom and dad, Sara Jo and Bud, are with us this evening. Welcome.Our nation is grateful to the fallen who live in the memory of our country. We are grateful toall who volunteer to wear our nation's uniform. And, as we honor our brave troops, let usnever forget the sacrifices of America's military families.Our offensive against terror involves more than military action. Ultimately, the only way todefeat the terrorists is to defeat their dark vision of hatred and fear by offering the hopefulalternative of political freedom and peaceful change. So the United States of America supportsdemocratic reform across the broader Middle East. Elections are vital, but they are only thebeginning.Raising up a democracy requires the rule of law, and protection of minorities, and strong,accountable institutions that last longer than a single vote. The great people of Egypt havevoted in a multiparty presidential election, and now their government should open paths ofpeaceful opposition that will reduce the appeal of radicalism. The Palestinian people havevoted in elections. And now the leaders of Hamas must recognize Israel, disarm, rejectterrorism and work for lasting peace. Saudi Arabia has taken the first steps of reform. Now itcan offer its people a better future by pressing forward with those efforts.Democracies in the Middle East will not look like our own, because they will reflect thetraditions of their own citizens. Yet liberty is the future of every nation in the Middle East,because liberty is the right and hope of all humanity. The same is true of Iran, a nation nowheld hostage by a small clerical elite that is isolating and repressing its people. The regime inthat country sponsors terrorists in the Palestinian territories and in Lebanon, and that mustcome to an end. The Iranian government is defying the world with its nuclear ambitions, andthe nations of the world must not permit the Iranian regime to gain nuclear weapons. Americawill continue to rally the world to confront these threats.And, tonight, let me speak directly to the citizens of Iran: America respects you and werespect your country. We respect your right to choose your own future and win your ownfreedom. And our nation hopes one day to be the closest of friends with a free and democraticIran.To overcome dangers in our world, we must also take the offensive by encouraging economicprogress and fighting disease and spreading hope in hopeless lands. Isolationism would notonly tie our hands in fighting enemies; it would keep us from helping our friends in desperateneed.We show compassion abroad because Americans believe in the God- given dignity and worthof a villager with HIV/AIDS, or an infant with malaria, or a refugee fleeing genocide, or ayoung girl sold into slavery. We also show compassion abroad because regions overwhelmedby poverty, corruption and despair are sources of terrorism and organized crime and humantrafficking and the drug trade. In recent years, you and I have taken unprecedented action tofight AIDS and malaria, expand the education of girls, and reward developing nations that aremoving forward with economic and political reform. For people everywhere, the United Statesis a partner for a better life. Short-changing these efforts would increase the suffering andchaos of our world, undercut our long-term security and dull the conscience of our country.I urge members of Congress to serve the interests of America by showing the compassion ofAmerica. Our country must also remain on the offensive against terrorism here at home. Theenemy has not lost the desire or capability to attack us. Fortunately, this nation has superbprofessionals in law enforcement, intelligence, the military and homeland security. These menand women are dedicating their lives to protecting us all, and they deserve our support andour thanks. They also deserve the same tools they already use to fight drug trafficking andorganized crime -- so I ask you to reauthorize the Patriot Act.It is said that prior to the attacks of September the 11th, our government failed to connectthe dots of the conspiracy. We now know that two of the hijackers in the United States placedtelephone calls to Al Qaida operatives overseas. But we did not know about their plans until itwas too late.So to prevent another attack -- based on authority given to me by the Constitution and bystatute -- I have authorized a terrorist surveillance program to aggressively pursue theinternational communications of suspected Al Qaida operatives and affiliates to and fromAmerica. Previous presidents have used the same constitutional authority I have and federalcourts have approved the use of that authority. Appropriate members of Congress have beenkept informed.The terrorist surveillance program has helped prevent terrorist attacks. It remains essential tothe security of America. If there are people inside our country who are talking with Al Qaida,we want to know about it, because we will not sit back and wait to be hit again. In all theseareas -- from the disruption of terror networks, to victory in Iraq, to the spread of freedomand hope in troubled regions -- we need the support of our friends and allies.To draw that support, we must always be clear in our principles and willing to act. The onlyalternative to American leadership is a dramatically more dangerous and anxious world. Yetwe also choose to lead because it is a privilege to serve the values that gave us birth.American leaders -- from Roosevelt, to Truman, to Kennedy, to Reagan -- rejected isolationand retreat because they knew that America is always more secure when freedom is on themarch.Our own generation is in a long war against a determined enemy, a war that will be fought bypresidents of both parties who will need steady bipartisan support from the Congress. Andtonight I ask for yours. Together, let us protect our country, support the men and women whodefend us, and lead this world toward freedom.Here at home, America also has a great opportunity: We will build the prosperity of ourcountry by strengthening our economic leadership in the world. Our economy is healthy andvigorous, and growing faster than other major industrialized nations. In the last two-and-a-half years, America has created 4.6 million new jobs -- more than Japan and the EuropeanUnion combined. Even in the face of higher energy prices and natural disasters, the Americanpeople have turned in an economic performance that is the envy of the world. The Americaneconomy is preeminent, but we cannot afford to be complacent. In a dynamic world economy,we are seeing new competitors like China and India. And this creates uncertainty, whichmakes it easier to feed people's fears.So we're seeing some old temptations return. Protectionists want to escape competition,pretending that we can keep our high standard of living while walling off our economy. Otherssay that the government needs to take a larger role in directing the economy, centralizingmore power in Washington and increasing taxes. We hear claims that immigrants aresomehow bad for the economy, even though this economy could not function without them.All these are forms of economic retreat, and they lead in the same direction: toward astagnant and second-rate economy.Tonight I will set out a better path: an agenda for a nation that competes with confidence, anagenda that will raise standards of living and generate new jobs. Americans should not fearour economic future, because we intend to shape it. Keeping America competitive begins withkeeping our economy growing. And our economy grows when Americans have more of theirown money to spend, save and invest.In the last five years, the tax relief you passed has left $880 billion in the hands of Americanworkers, investors, small businesses and families. And they have used it to help produce morethan four years of uninterrupted economic growth. Yet the tax relief is set to expire in thenext few years. If we do nothing, American families will face a massive tax increase they donot expect and will not welcome. Because America needs more than a temporary expansion,we need more than temporary tax relief. I urge the Congress to act responsibly and make thetax cuts permanent.Keeping America competitive requires us to be good stewards of tax dollars. Every year of mypresidency, we've reduced the growth of nonsecurity discretionary spending. And last yearyou passed bills that cut this spending. This year my budget will cut it again and reduce oreliminate more than 140 programs that are performing poorly or not fulfilling essentialpriorities. By passing these reforms, we will save the American taxpayer another $14 billionnext year and stay on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009.I am pleased that the members of Congress are working on earmark reform, because thefederal budget has too many special interest projects. And we can tackle this problemtogether, if you pass the line-item veto.We must also confront the larger challenge of mandatory spending, or entitlements. This year,the first of about 78 million baby boomers turns 60, including two of my dad's favorite people:me and President Clinton. This milestone is more than a personal crisis. It is a nationalchallenge.The retirement of the baby boom generation will put unprecedented strains on the federalgovernment. By 2030, spending for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid alone will bealmost 60 percent of the entire federal budget. And that will present future Congresses withimpossible choices: staggering tax increases, immense deficits or deep cuts in every categoryof spending. Congress did not act last year on my proposal to save Social Security, yet therising cost of entitlements is a problem that is not going away. And with every year we fail toact, the situation gets worse. So tonight I ask you to join me in creating a commission to examine the full impact of babyboom retirements on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. This commission should includemembers of Congress of both parties and offer bipartisan solutions. We need to put asidepartisan politics and work together and get this problem solved.Keeping America competitive requires us to open more markets for all that Americans makeand grow. One out of every five factory jobs in America is related to global trade, and we wantpeople everywhere to buy American. With open markets and a level playing field, no one canout- produce or out-compete the American worker. Keeping America competitive requires an immigration system that upholds our laws, reflectsour values and serves the interests of our economy. Our nation needs orderly and secureborders. To meet this goal, we must have stronger immigration enforcement and borderprotection. And we must have a rational, humane guest worker program that rejects amnesty,allows temporary jobs for people who seek them legally, and reduces smuggling and crime atthe border.Keeping America competitive requires affordable health care. Our government has aresponsibility to help provide health care for the poor and the elderly, and we are meetingthat responsibility. For all Americans -- for all Americans -- we must confront the rising cost ofcare, strengthen the doctor-patient relationship, and help people afford the insurancecoverage they need.We will make wider use of electronic records and other health information technology to helpcontrol costs and reduce dangerous medical errors. We will strengthen health savingsaccounts, making sure individuals and small-business employees can buy insurance with thesame advantages that people working for big businesses now get. We will do more to makethis coverage portable, so workers can switch jobs without having to worry about losing theirhealth insurance. And because lawsuits are driving many good doctors out of practice --leaving women in nearly 1,500 American counties without a single OB/GYN -- I ask theCongress to pass medical liability reform this year.Keeping America competitive requires affordable energy. And here we have a seriousproblem: America is addicted to oil, which is often imported from unstable parts of the world.The best way to break this addiction is through technology. Since 2001, we have spent nearly$10 billion to develop cleaner, cheaper and more reliable alternative energy sources. And weare on the threshold of incredible advances.So tonight I announce the Advanced Energy Initiative -- a 22 percent increase in clean-energyresearch at the Department of Energy to push for breakthroughs in two vital areas. To changehow we power our homes and offices, we will invest more in zero-emission coal-fired plants;revolutionary solar and wind technologies; and clean, safe nuclear energy. We must alsochange how we power our automobiles. We will increase our research in better batteries forhybrid and electric cars and in pollution-free cars that run on hydrogen.We will also fund additional research in cutting-edge methods of producing ethanol, not justfrom corn but from wood chips and stalks or switch grass. Our goal is to make this new kindof ethanol practical and competitive within six years. Breakthroughs on this and other newtechnologies will help us reach another great goal: to replace more than 75 percent of our oilimports from the Middle East by 2025. By applying -- By applying the talent and technology ofAmerica, this country can dramatically improve our environment, move beyond a petroleum-based economy and make our dependence on Middle Eastern oil a thing of the past.And to keep America competitive, one commitment is necessary above all: We must continueto lead the world in human talent and creativity. Our greatest advantage in the world hasalways been our educated, hardworking, ambitious people, and we are going to keep thatedge.Tonight I announce the American Competitiveness Initiative to encourage innovationthroughout our economy and to give our nation's children a firm grounding in math andscience.First, I propose to double the federal commitment to the most critical basic research programsin the physical sciences over the next 10 years. This funding will support the work ofAmerica's most creative minds as they explore promising areas such as nanotechnology,supercomputing and alternative energy sources.Second, I propose to make permanent the research and development tax credit, to encouragebolder private-sector initiatives in technology. With more research in both the public andprivate sectors, we will improve our quality of life and ensure that America will lead the worldin opportunity and innovation for decades to come.Third, we need to encourage children to take more math and science, and to make sure thosecourses are rigorous enough to compete with other nations. We made a good start in the earlygrades with the No Child Left Behind Act, which is raising standards and lifting test scoresacross our country.Tonight I propose to train 70,000 high school teachers to lead advanced placement courses inmath and science, bring 30,000 math and science professionals to teach in classrooms, andgive early help to students who struggle with math so they have a better chance at good,high-wage jobs. If we ensure that America's children succeed in life, they will ensure thatAmerica succeeds in the world. Preparing our nation to compete in the world is a goal that allof us can share. I urge you to support the American Competitiveness Initiative and, together,we will show the world what the American people can achieve.America is a great force for freedom and prosperity. Yet our greatness is not measured inpower or luxuries, but by who we are and how we treat one another. So we strive to be acompassionate, decent, hopeful society. In recent years, America has become a more hopefulnation. Violent crime rates have fallen to their lowest levels since the 1970s. Welfare caseshave dropped by more than half over the past decade. Drug use among youth is down 19percent since 2001. There are fewer abortions in America than at any point in the last threedecades.And the number of children born to teenage mothers has been falling for a dozen years in arow. These gains are evidence of a quiet transformation, a revolution of conscience in which arising generation is finding that a life of personal responsibility is a life of fulfillment.Government has played a role. Wise policies such as welfare reform, and drug education, andsupport for abstinence and adoption have made a difference in the character of our country.And everyone here tonight, Democrat and Republican, has a right to be proud of this record.Yet many Americans, especially parents, still have deep concerns about the direction of ourculture and the health of our most basic institutions. They are concerned about unethicalconduct by public officials and discouraged by activist courts that try to redefine marriage.They worry about children in our society who need direction and love, and about fellowcitizens still displaced by natural disaster, and about suffering caused by treatable diseases.As we look at these challenges, we must never give in to the belief that America is in declineor that our culture is doomed to unravel. The American people know better than that. Wehave proven the pessimists wrong before, and we will do it again.A hopeful society depends on courts that deliver equal justice under law. The Supreme Courtnow has two superb new members -- new members on its bench: Chief Justice John Robertsand Justice Sam Alito. I thank the Senate for confirming both of them. I will continue tonominate men and women who understand that judges must be servants of the law and notlegislate from the bench.Today marks the official retirement of a very special American. For 24 years of faithful serviceto our nation, the United States is grateful to Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.A hopeful society has institutions of science and medicine that do not cut ethical corners andthat recognize the matchless value of every life. Tonight I ask you to pass legislation toprohibit the most egregious abuses of medical research: human cloning in all its forms;creating or implanting embryos for experiments; creating human-animal hybrids; and buying,selling or patenting human embryos. Human life is a gift from our creator, and that gift shouldnever be discarded, devalued or put up for sale.A hopeful society expects elected officials to uphold the public trust. Honorable people in bothparties are working on reforms to strengthen the ethical standards of Washington. I supportyour efforts. Each of us has made a pledge to be worthy of public responsibility, and that is apledge we must never forget, never dismiss and never betray.As we renew the promise of our institutions, let us also show the character of America in ourcompassion and care for one another. As we renew the promise of our institutions, let us alsoshow the character of America in our compassion and care for one another.A hopeful society gives special attention to children who lack direction and love. Through theHelping America's Youth Initiative, we are encouraging caring adults to get involved in the lifeof a child. And this good work is led by our first lady, Laura Bush. This year we will addresources to encourage young people to stay in school so more of America's youth can raisetheir sights and achieve their dreams.A hopeful society comes to the aid of fellow citizens in times of suffering and emergency andstays at it until they're back on their feet. So far, the federal government has committed $85billion to the people of the Gulf Coast and New Orleans. We are removing debris and repairinghighways and rebuilding stronger levees. We're providing business loans and housingassistance.Yet, as we meet these immediate needs, we must also address deeper challenges that existedbefore the storm arrived. In New Orleans and in other places, many of our fellow citizens havefelt excluded from the promise of our country. The answer is not only temporary relief, butschools that teach every child, and job skills that bring upward mobility, and moreopportunities to own a home and start a business. As we recover from a disaster, let us alsowork for the day when all Americans are protected by justice; equal in hope and rich inopportunity.A hopeful society acts boldly to fight diseases like HIV/AIDS, which can be prevented andtreated and defeated. More than a million Americans live with HIV, and half of all AIDS casesoccur among African-Americans. I ask Congress to reform and reauthorize the Ryan White Actand provide new funding to states so we end the waiting lists for AIDS medicines in America.We will also lead a nationwide effort, working closely with African-American churches andfaith-based groups, to deliver rapid HIV tests to millions, end the stigma of AIDS and comecloser to the day when there are no new infections in America.Fellow citizens, we have been called to leadership in a period of consequence. We haveentered a great ideological conflict we did nothing to invite. We see great changes in scienceand commerce that will influence all our lives. Sometimes it can seem that history is turning ina wide arc, toward an unknown shore. Yet the destination of history is determined by humanaction, and every great movement of history comes to a point of choosing.Lincoln could have accepted peace at the cost of disunity and continued slavery. Martin LutherKing could have stopped at Birmingham or at Selma and achieved only half a victory oversegregation. The United States could have accepted the permanent division of Europe andbeen complicit in the oppression of others.Today, having come far in our own historical journey, we must decide: Will we turn back orfinish well? Before history is written down in books, it is written in courage. Like Americansbefore us, we will show that courage and we will finish well. We will lead freedom's advance.We will compete and excel in the global economy. We will renew the defining moralcommitments of this land. And so we move forward optimistic about our country, faithful to itscause and confident of the victories to come.May God bless America.",bush
"The issue of immigration stirs intense emotions, and in recent weeks, Americans have seenthose emotions on display. On the streets of major cities, crowds have rallied in support ofthose in our country illegally. At our southern border, others have organized to stop illegalimmigrants from coming in. Across the country, Americans are trying to reconcile thesecontrasting images. And in Washington, the debate over immigration reform has reached atime of decision. Tonight, I will make it clear where I stand, and where I want to lead ourcountry on this vital issue. We must begin by recognizing the problems with our immigration system. For decades, theUnited States has not been in complete control of its borders. As a result, many who want towork in our economy have been able to sneak across our border, and millions have stayed.Once here, illegal immigrants live in the shadows of our society. Many use forged documentsto get jobs, and that makes it difficult for employers to verify that the workers they hire arelegal. Illegal immigration puts pressure on public schools and hospitals, it strains state andlocal budgets, and brings crime to our communities. These are real problems. Yet we mustremember that the vast majority of illegal immigrants are decent people who work hard,support their families, practice their faith, and lead responsible lives. They are a part ofAmerican life, but they are beyond the reach and protection of American law. We're a nation of laws, and we must enforce our laws. We're also a nation of immigrants, andwe must uphold that tradition, which has strengthened our country in so many ways. Theseare not contradictory goals. America can be a lawful society and a welcoming society at thesame time. We will fix the problems created by illegal immigration, and we will deliver asystem that is secure, orderly, and fair. So I support comprehensive immigration reform thatwill accomplish five clear objectives. First, the United States must secure its borders. This is a basic responsibility of a sovereignnation. It is also an urgent requirement of our national security. Our objective isstraightforward: The border should be open to trade and lawful immigration, and shut toillegal immigrants, as well as criminals, drug dealers, and terrorists. I was a governor of a state that has a 1,200-mile border with Mexico. So I know how difficultit is to enforce the border, and how important it is. Since I became President, we've increasedfunding for border security by 66 percent, and expanded the Border Patrol from about 9,000to 12,000 agents. The men and women of our Border Patrol are doing a fine job in difficultcircumstances, and over the past five years, they have apprehended and sent home about sixmillion people entering America illegally. Despite this progress, we do not yet have full control of the border, and I am determined tochange that. Tonight I'm calling on Congress to provide funding for dramatic improvements inmanpower and technology at the border. By the end of 2008, we'll increase the number ofBorder Patrol officers by an additional 6,000. When these new agents are deployed, we'll havemore than doubled the size of the Border Patrol during my presidency.At the same time, we're launching the most technologically advanced border security initiativein American history. We will construct high-tech fences in urban corridors, and build newpatrol roads and barriers in rural areas. We'll employ motion sensors, infrared cameras, andunmanned aerial vehicles to prevent illegal crossings. America has the best technology in theworld, and we will ensure that the Border Patrol has the technology they need to do their joband secure our border. Training thousands of new Border Patrol agents and bringing the most advanced technology tothe border will take time. Yet the need to secure our border is urgent. So I'm announcingseveral immediate steps to strengthen border enforcement during this period of transition: One way to help during this transition is to use the National Guard. So, in coordination withgovernors, up to 6,000 Guard members will be deployed to our southern border. The BorderPatrol will remain in the lead. The Guard will assist the Border Patrol by operating surveillancesystems, analyzing intelligence, installing fences and vehicle barriers, building patrol roads,and providing training. Guard units will not be involved in direct law enforcement activities --that duty will be done by the Border Patrol. This initial commitment of Guard members wouldlast for a period of one year. After that, the number of Guard forces will be reduced as newBorder Patrol agents and new technologies come online. It is important for Americans to knowthat we have enough Guard forces to win the war on terror, to respond to natural disasters,and to help secure our border. The United States is not going to militarize the southern border. Mexico is our neighbor, andour friend. We will continue to work cooperatively to improve security on both sides of theborder, to confront common problems like drug trafficking and crime, and to reduce illegalimmigration. Another way to help during this period of transition is through state and local law enforcementin our border communities. So we'll increase federal funding for state and local authoritiesassisting the Border Patrol on targeted enforcement missions. We will give state and localauthorities the specialized training they need to help federal officers apprehend and detainillegal immigrants. State and local law enforcement officials are an important part of ourborder security and they need to be a part of our strategy to secure our borders.The steps I've outlined will improve our ability to catch people entering our country illegally.At the same time, we must ensure that every illegal immigrant we catch crossing our southernborder is returned home. More than 85 percent of the illegal immigrants we catch crossing thesouthern border are Mexicans, and most are sent back home within 24 hours. But when wecatch illegal immigrants from other country [sic] it is not as easy to send them home. Formany years, the government did not have enough space in our detention facilities to holdthem while the legal process unfolded. So most were released back into our society and askedto return for a court date. When the date arrived, the vast majority did not show up. Thispractice, called ""catch and release,"" is unacceptable, and we will end it. We're taking several important steps to meet this goal. We've expanded the number of bedsin our detention facilities, and we will continue to add more. We've expedited the legal processto cut the average deportation time. And we're making it clear to foreign governments thatthey must accept back their citizens who violate our immigration laws. As a result of theseactions, we've ended ""catch and release"" for illegal immigrants from some countries. And I willask Congress for additional funding and legal authority, so we can end ""catch and release"" atthe southern border once and for all. When people know that they'll be caught and sent homeif they enter our country illegally, they will be less likely to try to sneak in. Second, to secure our border, we must create a temporary worker program. The reality is thatthere are many people on the other side of our border who will do anything to come toAmerica to work and build a better life. They walk across miles of desert in the summer heat,or hide in the back of 18-wheelers to reach our country. This creates enormous pressure onour border that walls and patrols alone will not stop. To secure the border effectively, we mustreduce the numbers of people trying to sneak across. Therefore, I support a temporary worker program that would create a legal path for foreignworkers to enter our country in an orderly way, for a limited period of time. This programwould match willing foreign workers with willing American employers for jobs Americans arenot doing. Every worker who applies for the program would be required to pass criminalbackground checks. And temporary workers must return to their home country at theconclusion of their stay.A temporary worker program would meet the needs of our economy, and it would give honestimmigrants a way to provide for their families while respecting the law. A temporary workerprogram would reduce the appeal of human smugglers, and make it less likely that peoplewould risk their lives to cross the border. It would ease the financial burden on state and localgovernments, by replacing illegal workers with lawful taxpayers. And above all, a temporaryworker program would add to our security by making certain we know who is in our countryand why they are here. Third, we need to hold employers to account for the workers they hire. It is against the law tohire someone who is in this country illegally. Yet businesses often cannot verify the legalstatus of their employees because of the widespread problem of document fraud. Therefore,comprehensive immigration reform must include a better system for verifying documents andwork eligibility. A key part of that system should be a new identification card for every legalforeign worker. This card should use biometric technology, such as digital fingerprints, tomake it tamper-proof. A tamper-proof card would help us enforce the law, and leaveemployers with no excuse for violating it. And by making it harder for illegal immigrants tofind work in our country, we would discourage people from crossing the border illegally in thefirst place. Fourth, we must face the reality that millions of illegal immigrants are here already. Theyshould not be given an automatic path to citizenship. This is amnesty, and I oppose it.Amnesty would be unfair to those who are here lawfully, and it would invite further waves ofillegal immigration. Some in this country argue that the solution is to deport every illegal immigrant, and that anyproposal short of this amounts to amnesty. I disagree. It is neither wise, nor realistic to roundup millions of people, many with deep roots in the United States, and send them across theborder. There is a rational middle ground between granting an automatic path to citizenshipfor every illegal immigrant, and a program of mass deportation. That middle groundrecognizes there are differences between an illegal immigrant who crossed the borderrecently, and someone who has worked here for many years, and has a home, a family, andan otherwise clean record.I believe that illegal immigrants who have roots in our country and want to stay should haveto pay a meaningful penalty for breaking the law, to pay their taxes, to learn English, and towork in a job for a number of years. People who meet these conditions should be able to applyfor citizenship, but approval would not be automatic, and they will have to wait in line behindthose who played by the rules and followed the law. What I've just described is not amnesty,it is a way for those who have broken the law to pay their debt to society, and demonstratethe character that makes a good citizen. Fifth, we must honor the great American tradition of the melting pot, which has made us onenation out of many peoples. The success of our country depends upon helping newcomersassimilate into our society, and embrace our common identity as Americans. Americans arebound together by our shared ideals, an appreciation of our history, respect for the flag wefly, and an ability to speak and write the English language. English is also the key to unlockingthe opportunity of America. English allows newcomers to go from picking crops to opening agrocery, from cleaning offices to running offices, from a life of low-paying jobs to a diploma, acareer, and a home of their own. When immigrants assimilate and advance in our society,they realize their dreams, they renew our spirit, and they add to the unity of America. Tonight, I want to speak directly to members of the House and the Senate: An immigrationreform bill needs to be comprehensive, because all elements of this problem must beaddressed together, or none of them will be solved at all. The House has passed animmigration bill. The Senate should act by the end of this month so we can work out thedifferences between the two bills, and Congress can pass a comprehensive bill for me to signinto law. America needs to conduct this debate on immigration in a reasoned and respectful tone.Feelings run deep on this issue, and as we work it out, all of us need to keep some things inmind. We cannot build a unified country by inciting people to anger, or playing on anyone'sfears, or exploiting the issue of immigration for political gain. We must always remember thatreal lives will be affected by our debates and decisions, and that every human being hasdignity and value no matter what their citizenship papers say.I know many of you listening tonight have a parent or a grandparent who came here fromanother country with dreams of a better life. You know what freedom meant to them, and youknow that America is a more hopeful country because of their hard work and sacrifice. AsPresident, I've had the opportunity to meet people of many backgrounds, and hear whatAmerica means to them. On a visit to Bethesda Naval Hospital, Laura and I met a woundedMarine named Guadalupe Denogean. Master Gunnery Sergeant Denogean came to the UnitedStates from Mexico when he was a boy. He spent his summers picking crops with his family,and then he volunteered for the United States Marine Corps as soon as he was able. Duringthe liberation of Iraq, Master Gunnery Sergeant Denogean was seriously injured. And whenasked if he had any requests, he made two: a promotion for the corporal who helped rescuehim, and the chance to become an American citizen. And when this brave Marine raised hisright hand, and swore an oath to become a citizen of the country he had defended for morethan 26 years, I was honored to stand at his side. We will always be proud to welcome people like Guadalupe Denogean as fellow Americans.Our new immigrants are just what they've always been -- people willing to risk everything forthe dream of freedom. And America remains what she has always been: the great hope on thehorizon, an open door to the future, a blessed and promised land. We honor the heritage of allwho come here, no matter where they come from, because we trust in our country's geniusfor making us all Americans -- one nation under God. Thank you, and good night.",bush
"Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress: It's a great privilege to be here to outline a new budget and a new approach for governing our great country. I thank you foryour invitation to speak here tonight. I know Congress had to formally invite me, and it couldhave been a close vote. So, Mr. Vice President, I appreciate you being here to break the tie.I want to thank so many of you who have accepted my invitation to come to the White Houseto discuss important issues. We're off to a good start. I will continue to meet with you and askfor your input. You have been kind and candid, and I thank you for making a new Presidentfeel welcome.The last time I visited the Capitol, I came to take an oath on the steps of this building. Ipledged to honor our Constitution and laws. And I asked you to join me in setting a tone ofcivility and respect in Washington.I hope America is noticing the difference, because we're making progress. Together, we arechanging the tone in the Nation's Capital. And this spirit of respect and cooperation is vital,because, in the end, we will be judged not only by what we say or how we say it, we will bejudged by what we're able to accomplish. America today is a nation with great challenges, but greater resources. An artist usingstatistics as a brush could paint two very different pictures of our country. One would havewarning signs: increasing layoffs, rising energy prices, too many failing schools, persistentpoverty, the stubborn vestiges of racism. Another picture would be full of blessings: abalanced budget, big surpluses, a military that is second to none, a country at peace with itsneighbors, technology that is revolutionizing the world, and our greatest strength -- concernedcitizens who care for our country and care for each other. Neither picture is complete in and of itself. And tonight I challenge and invite Congress towork with me to use the resources of one picture to repaint the other; to direct theadvantages of our time to solve the problems of our people. Some of these resources willcome from government. Some, but not all. Year after year in Washington, budget debates seem to come down to an old, tired argument:on one side, those who want more government, regardless of the cost; on the other, thosewho want less government, regardless of the need. We should leave those arguments to thelast century, and chart a different course.Government has a role, and an important role. Yet, too much government crowds outinitiative and hard work, private charity and the private economy. Our new governing visionsays government should be active, but limited; engaged, but not overbearing. And my budgetis based on that philosophy. It is reasonable, and it is responsible. It meets our obligations, and funds our growing needs.We increase spending next year for Social Security and Medicare, and other entitlementprograms, by $81 billion. We've increased spending for discretionary programs by a veryresponsible 4 percent, above the rate of inflation. My plan pays down an unprecedentedamount of our national debt. And then, when money is still left over, my plan returns it to thepeople who earned it in the first place.A budget's impact is counted in dollars, but measured in lives. Excellent schools, qualityhealth care, a secure retirement, a cleaner environment, a stronger defense -- these are allimportant needs, and we fund them. The highest percentage increase in our budget should goto our children's education. Education is not my top priority -- education is my top priorityand, by supporting this budget, you'll make it yours, as well. Reading is the foundation of all learning. So during the next five years, we triple spending,adding $5 billion to help every child in America learn to read. Values are important, so we'vetripled funding for character education to teach our children not only reading and writing, butright from wrong. We've increased funding to train and recruit teachers, because we know a good educationstarts with a good teacher. And I have a wonderful partner in this effort. I like teachers somuch, I married one. Laura has begun a new effort to recruit Americans to the profession thatwill shape our future -- teaching. She will travel across America to promote sound teachingpractices and early reading skills in our schools and in programs such as Head Start. When it comes to our schools, dollars alone do not always make the difference. Funding isimportant, and so is reform. So we must tie funding to higher standards and accountability forresults.I believe in local control of schools. We should not, and we will not, run public schools fromWashington, D.C. Yet when the federal government spends tax dollars, we must insist onresults. Children should be tested on basic reading and math skills every year between gradesthree and eight. Measuring is the only way to know whether all our children are learning. AndI want to know, because I refuse to leave any child behind in America.Critics of testing contend it distracts from learning. They talk about teaching to the test. Butlet's put that logic to the test. If you test a child on basic math and reading skills, and you'reteaching to the test, you're teaching math and reading. And that's the whole idea. Asstandards rise, local schools will need more flexibility to meet them. So we must streamlinethe dozens of federal education programs into five, and let states spend money in thosecategories as they see fit.Schools will be given a reasonable chance to improve and the support to do so. Yet, if theydon't, if they continue to fail, we must give parents and students different options -- a betterpublic school, a private school, tutoring or a charter school. In the end, every child in a badsituation must be given a better choice because, when it comes to our children, failure issimply not an option.Another priority in my budget is to keep the vital promises of Medicare and Social Security,and together we will do so. To meet the health care needs of all America's seniors, we doublethe Medicare budget over the next 10 years. My budget dedicates $238 billion to Medicarenext year alone, enough to fund all current programs and to begin a new prescription drugbenefit for low-income seniors. No senior in America should have to choose between buyingfood and buying prescriptions.To make sure the retirement savings of America's seniors are not diverted in any otherprogram, my budget protects all $2.6 trillion of the Social Security surplus for Social Security,and for Social Security alone.My budget puts a priority on access to health care, without telling Americans what doctor theyhave to see or what coverage they must choose. Many working Americans do not have healthcare coverage, so we will help them buy their own insurance with refundable tax credits. Andto provide quality care in low-income neighborhoods, over the next five years we will doublethe number of people served at community health care centers.And we will address the concerns of those who have health coverage, yet worry theirinsurance company doesn't care and won't pay. Together this Congress and this President willfind common ground to make sure doctors make medical decisions, and patients get thehealth care they deserve with a patients' bill of rights.When it comes to their health, people want to get the medical care they need, not be forcedto go to court because they didn't get it. We will ensure access to the courts for those withlegitimate claims. But first, let's put in place a strong, independent review so we promotequality health care, not frivolous lawsuits.My budget also increases funding for medical research, which gives hope to many whostruggle with serious disease. Our prayers tonight are with one of your own who is engaged inhis own fight against cancer -- a fine representative, and a good man, Congressman JoeMoakley. I can think of no more appropriate tribute to Joe than to have the Congress finishthe job of doubling the budget for the National Institutes of Health.My new Freedom Initiative for Americans with Disabilities funds new technologies, expandsopportunities to work, and makes our society more welcoming. For the more than 50 millionAmericans with disabilities, we need to break down barriers to equality.The budget I propose to you also supports the people who keep our country strong and free,the men and women who serve in the United States military. I'm requesting $5.7 billion inincreased military pay and benefits, and health care and housing. Our men and women inuniform give America their best and we owe them our support.America's veterans honored their commitment to our country through their military service. Iwill honor our commitment to them with a million-dollar increase to ensure better access toquality care and faster decisions on benefit claims. My budget will improve our environment by accelerating the cleanup of toxic brownfields. AndI propose we make a major investment in conservation by fully funding the Land and WaterConservation Fund. Our national parks have a special place in our country's life. Our parks areplaces of great natural beauty and history. As good stewards, we must leave them better thanwe found them. So I propose providing $4.9 billion over five years for the upkeep of thesenational treasures. And my budget adopts a hopeful new approach to help the poor and the disadvantaged. Wemust encourage and support the work of charities and faith-based and community groups thatoffer help and love one person at a time. These groups are working in every neighborhood inAmerica to fight homelessness and addiction and domestic violence; to provide a hot meal ora mentor or a safe haven for our children. Government should welcome these groups to applyfor funds, not discriminate against them.Government cannot be replaced by charities or volunteers. Government should not fundreligious activities.  But our nation should support the good works of these good people whoare helping their neighbors in need. So I propose allowing all taxpayers, whether they itemizeor not, to deduct their charitable contributions. Estimates show this could encourage as muchas $14 billion a year in new charitable giving, money that will save and change lives. Our budget provides more than $700 million over the next 10 years for a federal compassioncapital fund, with a focused and noble mission, to provide a mentor to the more than 100million children with a parent in prison, and to support other local efforts to fight illiteracy,teen pregnancy, drug addiction and other difficult problems.With us tonight is the Mayor of Philadelphia. Please help me welcome Mayor John Street.Mayor Street has encouraged faith-based and community organizations to make a significantdifference in Philadelphia. He's invited me to his city this summer to see compassionateaction. I'm personally aware of just how effective the Mayor is. Mayor Street's a Democrat.Let the record show, I lost his city, big time. But some things are bigger than politics. So Ilook forward to coming to your city, to see your faith-based programs in action.As government promotes compassion, it also must promote justice. Too many of our citizenshave cause to doubt our nation's justice, when the law points a finger of suspicion at groups,instead of individuals. All our citizens are created equal, and must be treated equally.Earlier today, I asked John Ashcroft, the Attorney General, to develop specificrecommendations to end racial profiling. It's wrong and we will end it in America. In so doing,we will not hinder the work of our nation's brave police officers. They protect us every day --often at great risk. But by stopping the abuses of a few, we will add to the public confidenceour police officers earn and deserve.My budget has funded a responsible increase in our ongoing operations. It has funded ournation's important priorities. It has protected Social Security and Medicare. And our surplusesare big enough that there is still money left over. Many of you have talked about the need to pay down our national debt. I listened, and Iagree. We owe it to our children and grandchildren to act now, and I hope you will join me topay down $2 trillion in debt during the next 10 years.At the end of those 10 years, we will have paid down all the debt that is available to retire.That is more debt, repaid more quickly than has ever been repaid by any nation at any time inhistory. We should also prepare for the unexpected, for the uncertainties of the future. We shouldapproach our nation's budget as any prudent family would, with a contingency fund foremergencies or additional spending needs. For example, after a strategic review, we mayneed to increase defense spending. We may need to increase spending for our farmers oradditional money to reform Medicare. And so, my budget sets aside almost a trillion dollarsover 10 years for additional needs. That is one trillion additional reasons you can feelcomfortable supporting this budget. We have increased our budget at a responsible 4 percent. We have funded our priorities. Wepaid down all the available debt. We have prepared for contingencies. And we still havemoney left over. Yogi Berra once said, ""When you come to a fork in the road, take it."" Now, we come to a forkin the road; we have two choices. Even though we have already met our needs, we couldspend the money on more and bigger government. That's the road our nation has traveled inrecent years. Last year, government spending shot up 8 percent. That's far more than our economy grew,far more than personal income grew, and far more than the rate of inflation. If you continueon that road, you will spend the surplus and have to dip into Social Security to pay other bills.Unrestrained government spending is a dangerous road to deficits, so we must take adifferent path. The other choice is to let the American people spend their own money to meettheir own needs. I hope you will join me in standing firmly on the side of the people. You see, the growingsurplus exists because taxes are too high and government is charging more than it needs. Thepeople of America have been overcharged and, on their behalf, I am here asking for a refund.Some say my tax plan is too big. Others say it's too small. I respectfully disagree. This plan isjust right. I didn't throw darts at the board to come up with a number for tax relief. I didn'ttake a poll or develop an arbitrary formula that might sound good. I looked at problems in theTax Code and calculated the cost to fix them. A tax rate of 15 percent is too high for those who earn low wages, so we must lower the rateto 10 percent. No one should pay more than a third of the money they earn in federal incometaxes, so we lowered the top rate to 33 percent.This reform will be welcome relief for America's small businesses, which often pay taxes at thehighest rate. And help for small business means jobs for Americans. We simplified the TaxCode by reducing the number of tax rates from the current five rates to four lower ones, 10percent, 15, 25 and 33 percent. In my plan, no one is targeted in or targeted out. Everyonewho pays income taxes will get relief. Our government should not tax, and thereby discourage marriage, so we reduced themarriage penalty. I want to help families rear and support their children, so we doubled thechild credit to $1,000 per child. It's not fair to tax the same earnings twice -- once when youearn them, and again when you die -- so we must repeal the death tax.These changes add up to significant help. A typical family with two children will save $1,600 ayear on their federal income taxes. Now, $1,600 may not sound like a lot to some, but itmeans a lot to many families: $1,600 buys gas for two cars for an entire year; it pays tuitionfor a year at a community college; it pays the average family grocery bill for three months.That's real money. With us tonight representing many American families are Steven and Josefina Ramos. Theyare from Pennsylvania. But they could be from any one of your districts. Steven is the networkadministrator for a school district. Josefina is a Spanish teacher at a charter school. And theyhave a two-year-old daughter. Steven and Josefina tell me they pay almost $8,000 a year in federal income taxes. My planwill save them more than $2,000. Let me tell you what Steven says: ""Two thousand dollars ayear means a lot to my family.If we had this money, it would help us reach our goal of paying off our personal debt in twoyears' time."" After that, Steven and Josefina want to start saving for Lianna's collegeeducation. My attitude is, government should never stand in the way of families achieving their dreams.And as we debate this issue, always remember, the surplus is not the government's money,the surplus is the people's money.For lower-income families, my tax plan restores basic fairness. Right now, complicated taxrules punish hard work. A waitress supporting two children on $25,000 a year can lose nearlyhalf of every additional dollar she earns above the $25,000. Her overtime, her hardest hours,are taxed at nearly 20 percent. This sends a terrible message: you'll never get ahead. ButAmerica's message must be different. We must honor hard work, never punish it. With taxrelief, overtime will no longer be over-taxed time for the waitress. People with the smallestincomes will get the highest percentage of reductions. And millions of additional Americanfamilies will be removed from the income tax rolls entirely.Tax relief is right and tax relief is urgent. The long economic expansion that began almost 10years ago is faltering. Lower interest rates will eventually help, but we cannot assume theywill do the job all by themselves. Forty years ago, and then 20 years ago, two Presidents, one Democrat, one Republican, JohnF. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, advocated tax cuts to, in President Kennedy's words, get thiscountry moving again. They knew then what we must do now. To create economic growth andopportunity, we must put money back into the hands of the people who buy goods and createjobs. We must act quickly. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve has testified before Congress thattax cuts often come too late to stimulate economic recovery. So I want to work with you togive our economy an important jump-start by making tax relief retroactive.We must act now because it is the right thing to do. We must also act now because we haveother things to do. We must show courage to confront and resolve tough challenges, torestructure our nation's defenses, to meet our growing need for energy, and to reformMedicare and Social Security.America has a window of opportunity to extend and secure our present peace by promoting adistinctly American internationalism. We will work with our allies and friends to be a force forgood and a champion of freedom. We will work for free markets, free trade and freedom fromoppression. Nations making progress toward freedom will find America is their friend. We willpromote our values. We will promote the peace. And we need a strong military to keep thepeace. But our military was shaped to confront the challenges of the past. So I've asked theSecretary of Defense to review America's Armed Forces and prepare to transform them tomeet emerging threats. My budget makes a down payment on the research and developmentthat will be required. Yet, in our broader transformation effort, we must put strategy first,then spending. Our defense vision will drive our defense budget, not the other way around.Our nation also needs a clear strategy to confront the threats of the 21st century -- threatsthat are more widespread and less certain. They range from terrorists who threaten withbombs to tyrants in rogue nations intent upon developing weapons of mass destruction. Toprotect our own people, our allies and friends, we must develop and we must deploy effectivemissile defenses.And as we transform our military, we can discard Cold War relics, and reduce our own nuclearforces to reflect today's needs. A strong America is the world's best hope for peace andfreedom. Yet the cause of freedom rests on more than our ability to defend ourselves and our allies.Freedom is exported every day, as we ship goods and products that improve the lives ofmillions of people. Free trade brings greater political and personal freedom. Each of theprevious five Presidents has had the ability to negotiate far reaching trade agreements.Tonight I ask you to give me the strong hand of presidential trade promotion authority, and todo so quickly. As we meet tonight, many citizens are struggling with the high cost of energy. We have aserious energy problem that demands a national energy policy. The West is confronting amajor energy shortage that has resulted in high prices and uncertainty.I've asked federal agencies to work with California officials to help speed construction of newenergy sources, and I have direct Vice President Cheney, Commerce Secretary Evans, EnergySecretary Abraham and other senior members in my administration to develop a nationalenergy policy.Our energy demand outstrips our supply. We can produce more energy at home whileprotecting our environment, and we must. We can produce more electricity to meet demand,and we must. We can promote alternative energy sources and conservation, and we must.America must become more energy-independent, and we will. Perhaps the biggest test of our foresight and courage will be reforming Medicare and SocialSecurity. Medicare's finances are strained and its coverage is outdated. Ninety-nine percent ofemployer-provided health plans offer some form of prescription drug coverage; Medicare doesnot. The framework for reform has been developed by Senators Frist and Breaux andCongressman Thomas, and now is the time to act.Medicare must be modernized, and we must make sure that every senior on Medicare canchoose a health care plan that offers prescription drugs.Seven years from now, the baby boom generation will begin to claim Social Security benefits.Every one in this chamber knows that Social Security is not prepared to fully fund theirretirement. And we only have a couple of years to get prepared. Without reform, this countrywill one day awaken to a stark choice: either a drastic rise in payroll taxes or a radical cut inretirement benefits. There is a better way. This spring I will form a presidential commission to reform SocialSecurity. The commission will make its recommendations by next fall. Reform should be basedon these principles: It must preserve the benefits of all current retirees and those nearingretirement. It must return Social Security to sound financial footing. And it must offerpersonal savings accounts to younger workers who want them.Social Security now offers workers a return of less than 2 percent on the money they pay intothe system. To save the system, we must increase that by allowing younger workers to makesafe, sound investments that yield a higher rate of return.Ownership, access to wealth and independence should not be the privilege of the few. Theyare the hope of every American, and we must make them the foundation of Social Security.By confronting the tough challenge of reform, by being responsible with our budget, we canearn the trust of the American people. And we can add to that trust by enacting fair andbalanced election and campaign reforms.The agenda I have set before you tonight is worthy of a great nation. America is a nation atpeace, but not a nation at rest. Much has been given to us, and much is expected. Let usagree to bridge old divides. But let us also agree that our goodwill must be dedicated to greatgoals. Bipartisan is more than minding our matters. It is doing our duty.No one can speak in this Capitol and not be awed by its history. As so many turning points,debates in these chambers have reflected the collected or divided conscience of our country.And when we walk through Statuary Hall and see those men and women of marble, we'rereminded of their courage and achievement. Yet America's purpose is never found only in statues or history. America's purpose alwaysstands before us. Our generation must show courage in a time of blessing, as our nation hasalways shown in times of crisis. And our courage, issue by issue, can gather to greatness andserve our country. This is the privilege and responsibility we share. And if we work together,we can prove that public service is noble. We all came here for a reason. We all have things we want to accomplish and promises tokeep. Juntos podemos -- together we can.We can make Americans proud of their government. Together we can share in the credit ofmaking our country more prosperous and generous and just, and earn from our conscienceand from our fellow citizens the highest possible praise: Well done, good and faithful servants. Thank you all. Good night and God bless.",bush

May God bless you in yourrecovery.Next week, America will mark the fifth anniversary of September the 11th, 2001 terroristattacks. As this day approaches, it brings with it a flood of painful memories. We rememberthe horror of watching planes fly into the World Trade Center, and seeing the towers collapsebefore our eyes. We remember the sight of the Pentagon, broken and in flames. Weremember the rescue workers who rushed into burning buildings to save lives, knowing theymight never emerge again. We remember the brave passengers who charged the cockpit oftheir hijacked plane, and stopped the terrorists from reaching their target and killing moreinnocent civilians. We remember the cold brutality of the enemy who inflicted this harm on ourcountry -- an enemy whose leader, Osama bin Laden, declared the massacre of nearly 3,000people that day -- I quote -- ""an unparalleled and magnificent feat of valor, unmatched by anyin humankind before them.""In five years since our nation was attacked, al Qaeda and terrorists it has inspired havecontinued to attack across the world. They've killed the innocent in Europe and Africa and theMiddle East, in Central Asia and the Far East, and beyond. Most recently, they attempted tostrike again in the most ambitious plot since the attacks of September the 11th -- a plan toblow up passenger planes headed for America over the Atlantic Ocean.Five years after our nation was attacked, the terrorist danger remains. We're a nation at war -- and America and her allies are fighting this war with relentless determination across theworld. Together with our coalition partners, we've removed terrorist sanctuaries, disruptedtheir finances, killed and captured key operatives, broken up terrorist cells in America andother nations, and stopped new attacks before they're carried out. We're on the offenseagainst the terrorists on every battlefront -- and we'll accept nothing less than completevictory.In the five years since our nation was attacked, we've also learned a great deal about theenemy we face in this war. We've learned about them through videos and audio recordings,and letters and statements they've posted on websites. We've learned about them fromcaptured enemy documents that the terrorists have never meant for us to see. Together,these documents and statements have given us clear insight into the mind of our enemies --their ideology, their ambitions, and their strategy to defeat us.We know what the terrorists intend to do because they've told us -- and we need to take theirwords seriously. So today I'm going to describe -- in the terrorists' own words, what theybelieve... what they hope to accomplish, and how they intend to accomplish it. I'll discuss howthe enemy has adapted in the wake of our sustained offensive against them, and the threatposed by different strains of violent Islamic radicalism. I'll explain the strategy we're pursuingto protect America, by defeating the terrorists on the battlefield, and defeating their hatefulideology in the battle of ideas.The terrorists who attacked us on September the 11th, 2001, are men without conscience --but they're not madmen. They kill in the name of a clear and focused ideology, a set of beliefsthat are evil, but not insane. These al Qaeda terrorists and those who share their ideology areviolent Sunni extremists. They're driven by a radical and perverted vision of Islam that rejectstolerance, crushes all dissent, and justifies the murder of innocent men, women and childrenin the pursuit of political power. They hope to establish a violent political utopia across theMiddle East, which they call a ""Caliphate"" -- where all would be ruled according to their hatefulideology. Osama bin Laden has called the 9/11 attacks -- in his words -- ""a great step towardsthe unity of Muslims and establishing the Righteous... [Caliphate].""This caliphate would be a totalitarian Islamic empire encompassing all current and formerMuslim lands, stretching from Europe to North Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. Weknow this because al Qaeda has told us. About two months ago, the terrorist Zawahiri -- he'sal Qaeda's second in command -- declared that al Qaeda intends to impose its rule in ""everyland that was a home for Islam, from [Spain] to Iraq. He went on to say, ""The whole world isan open field for us.""We know what this radical empire would look like in practice, because we saw how theradicals imposed their ideology on the people of Afghanistan. Under the rule of the Talibanand al Qaeda, Afghanistan was a totalitarian nightmare -- a land where women wereimprisoned in their homes, men were beaten for missing prayer meetings, girls could not goto school, and children were forbidden the smallest pleasures like flying kites. Religious policeroamed the streets, beating and detaining civilians for perceived offenses. Women werepublicly whipped. Summary executions were held in Kabul's soccer stadium in front ofcheering mobs. And Afghanistan was turned into a launching pad for horrific attacks againstAmerica and other parts of the civilized world -- including many Muslim nations.The goal of these Sunni extremists is to remake the entire Muslim world in their radical image.In pursuit of their imperial aims, these extremists say there can be no compromise or dialoguewith those they call ""infidels"" -- a category that includes America, the world's free nations,Jews, and all Muslims who reject their extreme vision of Islam. They reject the possibility ofpeaceful coexistence with the free world. Again, hear the words of Osama bin Laden earlierthis year: ""Death is better than living on this Earth with the unbelievers among us.""These radicals have declared their uncompromising hostility to freedom. It is foolish to thinkthat you can negotiate with them.  We see the uncompromising nature of the enemy in manycaptured terrorist documents. Here are just two examples: After the liberation of Afghanistan,coalition forces searching through a terrorist safe house in that country found a copy of the alQaeda charter. This charter states that ""there will be continuing enmity until everyonebelieves in Allah. We will not meet [the enemy] halfway. There will be no room for dialoguewith them."" Another document was found in 2000 by British police during an anti-terrorist raidin London -- a grisly al Qaeda manual that includes chapters with titles such as ""Guidelines forBeating and Killing Hostages."" This manual declares that their vision of Islam ""doesnot...make a truce with unbelief, but rather confronts it."" The confrontation...calls for...thedialogue of bullets, the ideals of assassination, bombing, and destruction, and the diplomacyof the cannon and machine gun.""Still other captured documents show al Qaeda's strategy for infiltrating Muslim nations,establishing terrorist enclaves, overthrowing governments, and building their totalitarianempire. We see this strategy laid out in a captured al Qaeda document found during a recentraid in Iraq, which describes their plans to infiltrate and take over Iraq's western AnbarProvince.The document lays out an elaborate al Qaeda governing structure for the region that includesan Education Department, a Social Services Department, a Justice Department, and an""Execution Unit"" responsible for ""Sorting out, Arrest, Murder, and Destruction.""According to their public statements, countries that have -- they have targeted stretch fromthe Middle East to Africa, to Southeast Asia. Through this strategy, al Qaeda and its alliesintend to create numerous, decentralized operating bases across the world, from which theycan plan new attacks, and advance their vision of a unified, totalitarian Islamic state that canconfront and eventually destroy the free world.These violent extremists know that to realize this vision, they must first drive out the mainobstacle that stands in their way -- the United States of America. According to al Qaeda, theirstrategy to defeat America has two parts: First, they're waging a campaign of terror acrossthe world. They're targeting our forces abroad, hoping that the American people will growtired of casualties and give up the fight. And they're targeting America's financial centers andeconomic infrastructure at home, hoping to terrorize us and cause our economy to collapse. Bin Laden calls this his ""bleed-until-bankruptcy plan."" And he cited the attacks of 9/11 asevidence that such a plan can succeed. With the 9/11 attacks, Osama bin Laden says, ""alQaeda spent 500,000 dollars on the event, while America... lost -- according to the lowestestimate -- 500 billion dollars...meaning that every dollar of al Qaeda defeated a milliondollars of America. Bin Laden concludes from this experience that ""America is definitely agreat power, with... unbelievable military strength and a vibrant economy, but all of thesehave been built on a very weak and hollow foundation."" He went on to say, ""Therefore, it isvery easy to target the flimsy base and concentrate on their weak points, and even if we'reable to target one-tenth of these weak points, we will be able [to] crush and destroy them.""Secondly, along with this campaign of terror, the enemy has a propaganda strategy. Osamabin Laden laid out this strategy in a letter to the Taliban leader, Mullah Omar, that coalitionforces uncovered in Afghanistan in 2002. In it, bin Laden says that al Qaeda intends to""[launch],"" in his words, ""a media campaign... to create a wedge between the Americanpeople and their government."" This media campaign, bin Laden says, will send the Americanpeople a number of messages, including ""that their government [will] bring them more losses,in finances and casualties.""And he goes on to say that ""they are being sacrificed...to serve...the big investors, especiallythe Jews."" Bin Laden says that by delivering these messages, al Qaeda ""aims at creatingpressure from the American people on the American government to stop their campaignagainst Afghanistan."" Bin Laden and his allies are absolutely convinced they can succeed in forcing America toretreat and causing our economic collapse. They believe our nation is weak and decadent, andlacking in patience and resolve. And they're wrong.  Osama bin Laden has written that the""defeat of... American forces in Beirut"" in 1983 is proof America does not have the stomach tostay in the fight. He's declared that ""in Somalia...the United States [pulled] out, trailingdisappointment, defeat, and failure behind it."" And last year, the terrorist Zawahiri declaredthat Americans ""know better than others that there is no hope in victory. The Vietnam specteris closing every outlet.""These terrorists hope to drive America and our coalition out of Afghanistan, so they canrestore the safe haven they lost when coalition forces drove them out five years ago. Butthey've made clear that the most important front in their struggle against America is Iraq --the nation bin Laden has declared the ""capital of the Caliphate."" Hear the words of bin Laden:""I now address...the whole...Islamic nation: Listen and understand...The most...serious issuetoday for the whole world is this Third World War...[that] is raging in [Iraq]."" He calls it ""a warof destiny between infidelity and Islam."" He says, ""The whole world is watching this war,"" andthat it will end in ""victory and glory or misery and humiliation."" For al Qaeda, Iraq is not adistraction from their war on America -- it is the central battlefield where the outcome of thisstruggle will be decided. Here is what al Qaeda says they will do if they succeed in driving us out of Iraq: The terroristZawahiri has said that al Qaeda will proceed with ""several incremental goals. The first stage:Expel the Americans from Iraq. The second stage: Establish an Islamic authority or amirate,then develop it and support it until it achieves the level of Caliphate... The third stage: Extendthe jihad wave to the secular countries neighboring Iraq. And the fourth stage: ...the clashwith Israel.""These evil men know that a fundamental threat to their aspirations is a democratic Iraq thatcan govern itself, sustain itself, and defend itself. They know that given a choice, the Iraqipeople will never choose to live in the totalitarian state the extremists hope to establish. Andthat is why we must not, and we will not, give the enemy victory in Iraq by deserting the Iraqipeople.  Last year, the terrorist Zarqawi declared in a message posted on the Internet that democracy""is the essence of infidelity and deviation from the right path."" The Iraqi people disagree. LastDecember, nearly 12 million Iraqis from every ethnic and religious community turned out tovote in their country's third free election in less than a year. Iraq now has a unity governmentthat represents Iraq's diverse population -- and al Qaeda's top commander in Iraq breathedhis last breath.  Despite these strategic setbacks, the enemy will continue to fight freedom's advance in Iraq,because they understand the stakes in this war. Again, hear the words of bin Laden, in amessage to the American people earlier this year. He says: ""The war is for you or for us towin. If we win it, it means your defeat and disgrace forever."" Now, I know some of our country hear the terrorists' words, and hope that they will not, orcannot, do what they say. History teaches that underestimating the words of evil andambitious men is a terrible mistake. In the early 1900s, an exiled lawyer in Europe publisheda pamphlet called ""What Is To Be Done?"" -- in which he laid out his plan to launch acommunist revolution in Russia. The world did not heed Lenin's words, and paid a terribleprice. The Soviet Empire he established killed tens of millions, and brought the world to thebrink of thermonuclear war. In the 1920s, a failed Austrian painter published a book in whichhe explained his intention to build an Aryan super-state in Germany and take revenge onEurope and eradicate the Jews. The world ignored Hitler's words, and paid a terrible price. HisNazi regime killed millions in the gas chambers, and set the world aflame in war, before it wasfinally defeated at a terrible cost in lives. Bin Laden and his terrorist allies have made their intentions as clear as Lenin and Hitler beforethem. The question is: Will we listen? Will we pay attention to what these evil men say?America and our coalition partners have made our choice. We're taking the words of theenemy seriously. We're on the offensive, and we will not rest, we will not retreat, and we willnot withdraw from the fight, until this threat to civilization has been removed.Five years into this struggle, it's important to take stock of what's been accomplished -- andthe difficult work that remains. Al Qaeda has been weakened by our sustained offensiveagainst them, and today it is harder for al Qaeda's leaders to operate freely, to move money,or to communicate with their operatives and facilitators. Yet al Qaeda remains dangerous anddetermined. Bin Laden and Zawahiri remain in hiding in remote regions of this world. Al Qaedacontinues to adapt in the face of our global campaign against them. Increasingly, al Qaeda istaking advantage of the Internet to disseminate propaganda, and to conduct ""virtualrecruitment"" and ""virtual training"" of new terrorists. Al Qaeda's leaders no longer need tomeet face-to-face with their operatives. They can find new suicide bombers, and facilitate newterrorist attacks, without ever laying eyes on those they're training, financing, or sending tostrike us. As al Qaeda changes, the broader terrorist movement is also changing, becoming moredispersed and self-directed. More and more, we're facing threats from locally establishedterrorist cells that are inspired by al Qaeda's ideology and goals, but do not necessarily havedirect links to al Qaeda, such as training and funding. Some of these groups are made up of""homegrown"" terrorists, militant extremists who were born and educated in Western nations,were indoctrinated by radical Islamists or attracted to their ideology, and joined the violentextremist cause. These locally established cells appear to be responsible for a number ofattacks and plots, including those in Madrid, and Canada, and other countries across theworld.As we continue to fight al Qaeda and these Sunni extremists inspired by their radical ideology,we also face the threat posed by Shia extremists, who are learning from al Qaeda, increasingtheir assertiveness, and stepping up their threats. Like the vast majority of Sunnis, the vastmajority of Shia across the world reject the vision of extremists -- and in Iraq, millions of Shiahave defied terrorist threats to vote in free elections, and have shown their desire to live infreedom. The Shia extremists want to deny them this right. This Shia strain of Islamicradicalism is just as dangerous, and just as hostile to America, and just as determined toestablish its brand of hegemony across the broader Middle East. And the Shia extremists haveachieved something that al Qaeda has so far failed to do: In 1979, they took control of amajor power, the nation of Iran, subjugating its proud people to a regime of tyranny, andusing that nation's resources to fund the spread of terror and pursue their radical agenda.Like al Qaeda and the Sunni extremists, the Iranian regime has clear aims: They want to driveAmerica out of the region, to destroy Israel, and to dominate the broader Middle East. Toachieve these aims, they are funding and arming terrorist groups like Hezbollah, which allowthem to attack Israel and America by proxy. Hezbollah, the source of the current instability inLebanon, has killed more Americans than any terrorist organization except al Qaeda. Unlike alQaeda, they've not yet attacked the American homeland. Yet they're directly responsible forthe murder of hundreds of Americans abroad. It was Hezbollah that was behind the 1983bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut that killed 241 Americans. And Saudi Hezbollahwas behind the 1996 bombing of Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia that killed 19 Americans, anattack conducted by terrorists who we believe were working with Iranian officials. Just as we must take the words of the Sunni extremists seriously, we must take the words ofthe Shia extremists seriously. Listen to the words of Hezbollah's leader, the terroristNasrallah, who has declared his hatred of America. He says, ""Let the entire world hear me.Our hostility to the Great Satan [America] is absolute... Regardless of how the world haschanged after 11 September, Death to America will remain our reverberating and powerfulslogan: Death to America."" Iran's leaders, who back Hezbollah, have also declared their absolute hostility to America. LastOctober, Iran's President declared in a speech that some people ask -- in his words --""whether a world without the United States and Zionism can be achieved...I say thatthis...goal is achievable."" Less than three months ago, Iran's President declared to Americaand other Western powers: ""open your eyes and see the fate of pharaoh... if you do notabandon the path of falsehood...your doomed destiny will be annihilation."" Less than twomonths ago, he warned: ""The anger of Muslims may reach an explosion point soon. If such aday comes...[America and the West] should know that the waves of the blast will not remainwithin the boundaries of our region."" He also delivered this message to the American people:""If you would like to have good relations with the Iranian nation in the future...bow downbefore the greatness of the Iranian nation and surrender. If you don't accept [to do this], theIranian nation will...force you to surrender and bow down.""America will not bow down to tyrants.The Iranian regime and its terrorist proxies have demonstrated their willingness to killAmericans -- and now the Iranian regime is pursuing nuclear weapons. The world is workingtogether to prevent Iran's regime from acquiring the tools of mass murder. The internationalcommunity has made a reasonable proposal to Iran's leaders, and given them the opportunityto set their nation on a better course. So far, Iran's leaders have rejected this offer. Theirchoice is increasingly isolating the great Iranian nation from the international community, anddenying the Iranian people an opportunity for greater economic prosperity. It's time for Iran'sleader to make a different choice. And we've made our choice. We'll continue to work closelywith our allies to find a diplomatic solution. The world's free nations will not allow Iran todevelop a nuclear weapon.  The Shia and Sunni extremists represent different faces of the same threat. They drawinspiration from different sources, but both seek to impose a dark vision of violent Islamicradicalism across the Middle East. They oppose the advance of freedom, and they want to gaincontrol of weapons of mass destruction. If they succeed in undermining fragile democracies,like Iraq, and drive the forces of freedom out of the region, they will have an open field topursue their dangerous goals. Each strain of violent Islamic radicalism would be emboldenedin their efforts to topple moderate governments and establish terrorist safe havens. Imagine a world in which they were able to control governments, a world awash with oil andthey would use oil resources to punish industrialized nations. And they would use thoseresources to fuel their radical agenda, and pursue and purchase weapons of mass murder.And armed with nuclear weapons, they would blackmail the free world, and spread theirideologies of hate, and raise a mortal threat to the American people. If we allow them to dothis, if we retreat from Iraq, if we don't uphold our duty to support those who are desirous tolive in liberty, 50 years from now history will look back on our time with unforgiving clarity,and demand to know why we did not act. I'm not going to allow this to happen -- and no future American President can allow it either.America did not seek this global struggle, but we're answering history's call with confidenceand a clear strategy. Today we're releasing a document called the ""National Strategy forCombating Terrorism."" This is an unclassified version of the strategy we've been pursuingsince September the 11th, 2001. This strategy was first released in February 2003; it's beenupdated to take into account the changing nature of this enemy.This strategy document is posted on the White House website -- whitehouse.gov. And I urgeall Americans to read it. Our strategy for combating terrorism has five basic elements:First, we're determined to prevent terrorist attacks before they occur. So we're taking thefight to the enemy. The best way to protect America is to stay on the offense. Since 9/11, ourcoalition has captured or killed al Qaeda managers and operatives, and scores of otherterrorists across the world. The enemy is living under constant pressure, and we intend tokeep it that way -- and this adds to our security. When terrorists spend their days working toavoid death or capture, it's harder for them to plan and execute new attacks. We're also fighting the enemy here at home. We've given our law enforcement andintelligence professionals the tools they need to stop the terrorists in our midst. We passedthe Patriot Act to break down the wall that prevented law enforcement and intelligence fromsharing vital information. We created the Terrorist Surveillance Program to monitor thecommunications between al Qaeda commanders abroad and terrorist operatives within ourborders. If al Qaeda is calling somebody in America, we need to know why, in order to stopattacks.  I want to thank these three Senators for working with us to give our law enforcement andintelligence officers the tools necessary to do their jobs.  And over the last five years, federal,state, and local law enforcement have used those tools to break up terrorist cells, and toprosecute terrorist operatives and supporters in New York, and Oregon, and Virginia, andTexas, and New Jersey, and Illinois, Ohio, and other states. By taking the battle to theterrorists and their supporters on our own soil and across the world, we've stopped a numberof al Qaeda plots. Second, we're determined to deny weapons of mass destruction to outlaw regimes andterrorists who would use them without hesitation. Working with Great Britain and Pakistan andother nations, the United States shut down the world's most dangerous nuclear trading cartel,the AQ Khan network. This network had supplied Iran and Libya and North Korea withequipment and know-how that advanced their efforts to obtain nuclear weapons.And we launched the Proliferation Security Initiative, a coalition of more than 70 nations thatis working together to stop shipments related to weapons of mass destruction on land, at sea,and in the air. The greatest threat this world faces is the danger of extremists and terroristsarmed with weapons of mass destruction -- and this is a threat America cannot defeat on herown. We applaud the determined efforts of many nations around the world to stop the spreadof these dangerous weapons. Together, we pledge we'll continue to work together to stop theworld's most dangerous men from getting their hands on the world's most dangerousweapons.  Third, we're determined to deny terrorists the support of outlaw regimes. After September the11th, I laid out a clear doctrine: America makes no distinction between those who commitacts of terror, and those that harbor and support them, because they're equally guilty ofmurder. Thanks to our efforts, there are now three fewer state sponsors of terror in the worldthan there were on September the 11th, 2001. Afghanistan and Iraq have been transformedfrom terrorist states into allies in the war on terror. And the nation of Libya has renouncedterrorism, and given up its weapons of mass destruction programs, and its nuclear materialsand equipment. Over the past five years, we've acted to disrupt the flow of weapons andsupport from terrorist states to terrorist networks. And we have made clear that anygovernment that chooses to be an ally of terror has also chosen to be an enemy ofcivilization.  Fourth, we're determined to deny terrorist networks control of any nation, or territory within anation. So, along with our coalition and the Iraqi government, we'll stop the terrorists fromtaking control of Iraq, and establishing a new safe haven from which to attack America andthe free world. And we're working with friends and allies to deny the terrorists the enclavesthey seek to establish in ungoverned areas across the world. By helping governments reclaimfull sovereign control over their territory, we make ourselves more secure. Fifth, we're working to deny terrorists new recruits, by defeating their hateful ideology andspreading the hope of freedom -- by spreading the hope of freedom across the Middle East.For decades, American policy sought to achieve peace in the Middle East by pursuing stabilityat the expense of liberty. The lack of freedom in that region helped create conditions whereanger and resentment grew, and radicalism thrived, and terrorists found willing recruits. Andwe saw the consequences on September the 11th, when the terrorists brought death anddestruction to our country. The policy wasn't working.The experience of September the 11th made clear, in the long run, the only way to secure ournation is to change the course of the Middle East. So America has committed its influence inthe world to advancing freedom and liberty and democracy as the great alternatives torepression and radicalism.  We're taking the side of democratic leaders and moderates andreformers across the Middle East. We strongly support the voices of tolerance and moderationin the Muslim world. We're standing with Afghanistan's elected government against al Qaedaand the Taliban remnants that are trying to restore tyranny in that country. We're standingwith Lebanon's young democracy against the foreign forces that are seeking to undermine thecountry's sovereignty and independence. And we're standing with the leaders of Iraq's unitygovernment as they work to defeat the enemies of freedom, and chart a more hopeful coursefor their people. This is why victory is so important in Iraq. By helping freedom succeed inIraq, we will help America, and the Middle East, and the world become more secure.During the last five years we've learned a lot about this enemy. We've learned that they'recunning and sophisticated. We've witnessed their ability to change their methods and theirtactics with deadly speed -- even as their murderous obsessions remain unchanging. We'veseen that it's the terrorists who have declared war on Muslims, slaughtering huge numbers ofinnocent Muslim men and women around the world. We know what the terrorists believe, we know what they have done, and we know what theyintend to do. And now the world's free nations must summon the will to meet this greatchallenge. The road ahead is going to be difficult, and it will require more sacrifice. Yet we canhave confidence in the outcome, because we've seen freedom conquer tyranny and terrorbefore. In the 20th century, free nations confronted and defeated Nazi Germany. During theCold War, we confronted Soviet communism, and today Europe is whole, free and at peace. And now, freedom is once again contending with the forces of darkness and tyranny. Thistime, the battle is unfolding in a new region -- the broader Middle East. This time, we're notwaiting for our enemies to gather in strength. This time, we're confronting them before theygain the capacity to inflict unspeakable damage on the world, and we're confronting theirhateful ideology before it fully takes root.We see a day when people across the Middle East have governments that honor their dignity,and unleash their creativity, and count their votes. We see a day when across this regioncitizens are allowed to express themselves freely, women have full rights, and children areeducated and given the tools necessary to succeed in life. And we see a day when all thenations of the Middle East are allies in the cause of peace. We fight for this day, because the security of our own citizens depends on it. This is the greatideological struggle of the 21st century -- and it is the calling of our generation. All civilizednations are bound together in this struggle between moderation and extremism. By comingtogether, we will roll back this grave threat to our way of life. We will help the people of theMiddle East claim their freedom, and we will leave a safer and more hopeful world for ourchildren and grandchildren.God bless.",bush
"Ambassador Negroponte, General Hayden, members of the United States Congress, familieswho lost loved ones in the terrorist attacks on our nation, and my fellow citizens: Thanks forcoming. On the morning of September the 11th, 2001, our nation awoke to a nightmare attack.Nineteen men, armed with box cutters, took control of airplanes and turned them intomissiles. They used them to kill nearly 3,000 innocent people. We watched the Twin Towerscollapse before our eyes -- and it became instantly clear that we'd entered a new world, and adangerous new war. The attacks of September the 11th horrified our nation. And amid the grief came new fearsand urgent questions: Who had attacked us? What did they want? And what else were theyplanning? Americans saw the destruction the terrorists had caused in New York, andWashington, and Pennsylvania, and they wondered if there were other terrorist cells in ourmidst poised to strike; they wondered if there was a second wave of attacks still to come.With the Twin Towers and the Pentagon still smoldering, our country on edge, and a stream ofintelligence coming in about potential new attacks, my Administration faced immediatechallenges: We had to respond to the attack on our country. We had to wage anunprecedented war against an enemy unlike any we had fought before. We had to find theterrorists hiding in America and across the world, before they were able to strike our countryagain. So in the early days and weeks after 9/11, I directed our government's senior nationalsecurity officials to do everything in their power, within our laws, to prevent another attack. Nearly five years have passed since these -- those initial days of shock and sadness -- and weare thankful that the terrorists have not succeeded in launching another attack on our soil.This is not for the lack of desire or determination on the part of the enemy. As the recentlyfoiled plot in London shows, the terrorists are still active, and they're still trying to strikeAmerica, and they're still trying to kill our people. One reason the terrorists have notsucceeded is because of the hard work of thousands of dedicated men and women in ourgovernment, who have toiled day and night, along with our allies, to stop the enemy fromcarrying out their plans. And we are grateful for these hardworking citizens of ours. Another reason the terrorists have not succeeded is because our government has changed itspolicies -- and given our military, intelligence, and law enforcement personnel the tools theyneed to fight this enemy and protect our people and preserve our freedoms.  The terrorists who declared war on America represent no nation, they defend no territory,and they wear no uniform. They do not mass armies on borders, or flotillas of warships on thehigh seas. They operate in the shadows of society; they send small teams of operatives toinfiltrate free nations; they live quietly among their victims; they conspire in secret, and thenthey strike without warning. In this new war, the most important source of information onwhere the terrorists are hiding and what they are planning is the terrorists, themselves.Captured terrorists have unique knowledge about how terrorist networks operate. They haveknowledge of where their operatives are deployed, and knowledge about what plots areunderway. This intelligence -- this is intelligence that cannot be found any other place. Andour security depends on getting this kind of information. To win the war on terror, we must beable to detain, question, and, when appropriate, prosecute terrorists captured here inAmerica, and on the battlefields around the world. After the 9/11 attacks, our coalition launched operations across the world to remove terroristsafe havens, and capture or kill terrorist operatives and leaders.Working with our allies, we've captured and detained thousands of terrorists and enemyfighters in Afghanistan, in Iraq, and other fronts of this war on terror. These enemy -- theseare enemy combatants, who were waging war on our nation. We have a right under the lawsof war, and we have an obligation to the American people, to detain these enemies and stopthem from rejoining the battle. Most of the enemy combatants we capture are held in Afghanistan or in Iraq, where they'requestioned by our military personnel. Many are released after questioning, or turned over tolocal authorities -- if we determine that they do not pose a continuing threat and no longerhave significant intelligence value. Others remain in American custody near the battlefield, toensure that they don't return to the fight. In some cases, we determine that individuals we have captured pose a significant threat, ormay have intelligence that we and our allies need to have to prevent new attacks. Many are alQaeda operatives or Taliban fighters trying to conceal their identities, and they withholdinformation that could save American lives. In these cases, it has been necessary to movethese individuals to an environment where they can be held secretly [sic], questioned byexperts, and -- when appropriate -- prosecuted for terrorist acts. Some of these individuals are taken to the United States Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay,Cuba. It's important for Americans and others across the world to understand the kind ofpeople held at Guantanamo. These aren't common criminals, or bystanders accidentally sweptup on the battlefield -- we have in place a rigorous process to ensure those held atGuantanamo Bay belong at Guantanamo. Those held at Guantanamo include suspected bombmakers, terrorist trainers, recruiters and facilitators, and potential suicide bombers. They arein our custody so they cannot murder our people. One detainee held at Guantanamo told aquestioner questioning him -- he said this: ""I'll never forget your face. I will kill you, yourbrothers, your mother, and sisters."" In addition to the terrorists held at Guantanamo, a small number of suspected terroristleaders and operatives captured during the war have been held and questioned outside theUnited States, in a separate program operated by the Central Intelligence Agency. This groupincludes individuals believed to be the key architects of the September the 11th attacks, andattacks on the USS Cole, an operative involved in the bombings of our embassies in Kenyaand Tanzania, and individuals involved in other attacks that have taken the lives of innocentcivilians across the world. These are dangerous men with unparalleled knowledge aboutterrorist networks and their plans for new attacks. The security of our nation and the lives ofour citizens depend on our ability to learn what these terrorists know.Many specifics of this program, including where these detainees have been held and thedetails of their confinement, cannot be divulged. Doing so would provide our enemies withinformation they could use to take retribution against our allies and harm our country. I cansay that questioning the detainees in this program has given us information that has savedinnocent lives by helping us stop new attacks -- here in the United States and across theworld. Today, I'm going to share with you some of the examples provided by our intelligencecommunity of how this program has saved lives; why it remains vital to the security of theUnited States, and our friends and allies; and why it deserves the support of the United StatesCongress and the American people. Within months of September the 11th, 2001, we captured a man known as Abu Zubaydah. Webelieve that Zubaydah was a senior terrorist leader and a trusted associate of Osama binLaden. Our intelligence community believes he had run a terrorist camp in Afghanistan wheresome of the 9/11 hijackers trained, and that he helped smuggle al Qaeda leaders out ofAfghanistan after coalition forces arrived to liberate that country. Zubaydah was severelywounded during the firefight that brought him into custody -- and he survived only because ofthe medical care arranged by the CIA. After he recovered, Zubaydah was defiant and evasive. He declared his hatred of America.During questioning, he at first disclosed what he thought was nominal information -- and thenstopped all cooperation. Well, in fact, the ""nominal"" information he gave us turned out to bequite important. For example, Zubaydah disclosed Khalid Sheikh Mohammed -- or KSM -- wasthe mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks, and used the alias ""Muktar."" This was a vital piece ofthe puzzle that helped our intelligence community pursue KSM. Abu Zubaydah also providedinformation that helped stop a terrorist attack being planned for inside the United States -- anattack about which we had no previous information. Zubaydah told us that al Qaedaoperatives were planning to launch an attack in the U.S., and provided physical descriptions ofthe operatives and information on their general location. Based on the information heprovided, the operatives were detained -- one while traveling to the United States. We knew that Zubaydah had more information that could save innocent lives, but he stoppedtalking. As his questioning proceeded, it became clear that he had received training on how toresist interrogation. And so the CIA used an alternative set of procedures. These procedureswere designed to be safe, to comply with our laws, our Constitution, and our treatyobligations. The Department of Justice reviewed the authorized methods extensively anddetermined them to be lawful.I cannot describe the specific methods used -- I think you understand why -- if I did, it wouldhelp the terrorists learn how to resist questioning, and to keep information from us that weneed to prevent new attacks on our country. But I can say the procedures were tough, andthey were safe, and lawful, and necessary. Zubaydah was questioned using these procedures, and soon he began to provide informationon key al Qaeda operatives, including information that helped us find and capture more ofthose responsible for the attacks on September the 11th. For example, Zubaydah identifiedone of KSM's accomplices in the 9/11 attacks -- a terrorist named Ramzi bin al Shibh. Theinformation Zubaydah provided helped lead to the capture of bin al Shibh. And together thesetwo terrorists provided information that helped in the planning and execution of the operationthat captured Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. Once in our custody, KSM was questioned by the CIA using these procedures, and he soonprovided information that helped us stop another planned attack on the United States. Duringquestioning, KSM told us about another al Qaeda operative he knew was in CIA custody -- aterrorist named Majid Khan. KSM revealed that Khan had been told to deliver $50,000 toindividuals working for a suspected terrorist leader named Hambali, the leader of al Qaeda'sSoutheast Asian affiliate known as ""J-I"". CIA officers confronted Khan with this information.Khan confirmed that the money had been delivered to an operative named Zubair, andprovided both a physical description and contact number for this operative. Based on that information, Zubair was captured in June of 2003, and he soon providedinformation that helped lead to the capture of Hambali. After Hambali's arrest, KSM wasquestioned again. He identified Hambali's brother as the leader of a ""J-I"" cell, and Hambali'sconduit for communications with al Qaeda. Hambali's brother was soon captured in Pakistan,and, in turn, led us to a cell of 17 Southeast Asian ""J-I"" operatives. When confronted with thenews that his terror cell had been broken up, Hambali admitted that the operatives were beinggroomed at KSM's request for attacks inside the United States -- probably [sic] usingairplanes. During questioning, KSM also provided many details of other plots to kill innocent Americans.For example, he described the design of planned attacks on buildings inside the United States,and how operatives were directed to carry them out. He told us the operatives had beeninstructed to ensure that the explosives went off at a point that was high enough to preventthe people trapped above from escaping out the windows.KSM also provided vital information on al Qaeda's efforts to obtain biological weapons. Duringquestioning, KSM admitted that he had met three individuals involved in al Qaeda's efforts toproduce anthrax, a deadly biological agent -- and he identified one of the individuals as aterrorist named Yazid. KSM apparently believed we already had this information, becauseYazid had been captured and taken into foreign custody before KSM's arrest. In fact, we didnot know about Yazid's role in al Qaeda's anthrax program. Information from Yazid thenhelped lead to the capture of his two principal assistants in the anthrax program. Without theinformation provided by KSM and Yazid, we might not have uncovered this al Qaeda biologicalweapons program, or stopped this al Qaeda cell from developing anthrax for attacks againstthe United States. These are some of the plots that have been stopped because of the information of this vitalprogram. Terrorists held in CIA custody have also provided information that helped stop aplanned strike on U.S. Marines at Camp Lemonier in Djibouti -- they were going to use anexplosive laden water tanker. They helped stop a planned attack on the U.S. consulate inKarachi using car bombs and motorcycle bombs, and they helped stop a plot to hijackpassenger planes and fly them into Heathrow or the Canary Wharf in London. We're getting vital information necessary to do our jobs, and that's to protect the Americanpeople and our allies. Information from the terrorists in this program has helped us to identify individuals that alQaeda deemed suitable for Western operations, many of whom we had never heard aboutbefore. They include terrorists who were set to case targets inside the United States, includingfinancial buildings in major cities on the East Coast. Information from terrorists in CIA custodyhas played a role in the capture or questioning of nearly every senior al Qaeda member orassociate detained by the U.S. and its allies since this program began. By providing everythingfrom initial leads to photo identifications, to precise locations of where terrorists were hiding,this program has helped us to take potential mass murderers off the streets before they wereable to kill. This program has also played a critical role in helping us understand the enemy we face in thiswar. Terrorists in this program have painted a picture of al Qaeda's structure and financing,and communications and logistics. They identified al Qaeda's travel routes and safe havens,and explained how al Qaeda's senior leadership communicates with its operatives in placeslike Iraq.They provided information that allows us -- that has allowed us to make sense of documentsand computer records that we have seized in terrorist raids. They've identified voices inrecordings of intercepted calls, and helped us understand the meaning of potentially criticalterrorist communications. The information we get from these detainees is corroborated by intelligence, and we'vereceived -- that we've received from other sources -- and together this intelligence has helpedus connect the dots and stop attacks before they occur. Information from the terroristsquestioned in this program helped unravel plots and terrorist cells in Europe and in otherplaces. It's helped our allies protect their people from deadly enemies. This program hasbeen, and remains, one of the most vital tools in our war against the terrorists. It is invaluableto America and to our allies. Were it not for this program, our intelligence community believesthat al Qaeda and its allies would have succeeded in launching another attack against theAmerican homeland. By giving us information about terrorist plans we could not get anywhereelse, this program has saved innocent lives. This program has been subject to multiple legal reviews by the Department of Justice and CIAlawyers; they've determined it complied with our laws. This program has received strictoversight by the CIA's Inspector General. A small number of key leaders from both politicalparties on Capitol Hill were briefed about this program. All those involved in the questioning ofthe terrorists are carefully chosen and they're screened from a pool of experienced CIAofficers. Those selected to conduct the most sensitive questioning had to complete more than250 additional hours of specialized training before they are allowed to have contact with acaptured terrorist. I want to be absolutely clear with our people, and the world: The United States does nottorture. It's against our laws, and it's against our values. I have not authorized it -- and I willnot authorize it. Last year, my Administration worked with Senator John McCain, and I signedinto law the Detainee Treatment Act, which established the legal standard for treatment ofdetainees wherever they are held. I support this act. And as we implement this law, ourgovernment will continue to use every lawful method to obtain intelligence that can protectinnocent people, and stop another attack like the one we experienced on September the 11th,2001. The CIA program has detained only a limited number of terrorists at any given time -- andonce we've determined that the terrorists held by the CIA have little or no additionalintelligence value, many of them have been returned to their home countries for prosecutionor detention by their governments.Others have been accused of terrible crimes against the American people, and we have a dutyto bring those responsible for these crimes to justice. So we intend to prosecute these men,as appropriate, for their crimes. Soon after the war on terror began, I authorized a system of military commissions to tryforeign terrorists accused of war crimes. Military commissions have been used by Presidentsfrom George Washington to Franklin Roosevelt to prosecute war criminals, because the rulesfor trying enemy combatants in a time of conflict must be different from those for tryingcommon criminals or members of our own military. One of the first suspected terrorists to beput on trial by military commission was one of Osama bin Laden's bodyguards -- a mannamed Hamdan. His lawyers challenged the legality of the military commission system. It tookmore than two years for this case to make its way through the courts. The Court of Appealsfor the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the military commissions we had designed, but thispast June, the Supreme Court overturned that decision. The Supreme Court determined thatmilitary commissions are an appropriate venue for trying terrorists, but ruled that militarycommissions needed to be explicitly authorized by the United States Congress. So today, I'm sending Congress legislation to specifically authorize the creation of militarycommissions to try terrorists for war crimes. My Administration has been working withmembers of both parties in the House and Senate on this legislation. We put forward a billthat ensures these commissions are established in a way that protects our national security,and ensures a full and fair trial for those accused. The procedures in the bill I am sending toCongress today reflect the reality that we are a nation at war, and that it's essential for us touse all reliable evidence to bring these people to justice. We're now approaching the five-year anniversary of the 9/11 attacks -- and the families ofthose murdered that day have waited patiently for justice. Some of the families are with ustoday -- they should have to wait no longer. So I'm announcing today that Khalid SheikhMohammed, Abu Zubaydah, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, and 11 other terrorists in CIA custody havebeen transferred to the United States Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay. They are being held inthe custody of the Department of Defense. As soon as Congress acts to authorize the militarycommissions I have proposed, the men our intelligence officials believe orchestrated thedeaths of nearly 3,000 Americans on September the 11th, 2001, can face justice. We'll also seek to prosecute those believed to be responsible for the attack on the USS Cole,and an operative believed to be involved in the bombings of the American embassies in Kenyaand Tanzania. With these prosecutions, we will send a clear message to those who killAmericans: No longer -- how long it takes, we will find you and we will bring you to justice.These men will be held in a high-security facility at Guantanamo. The International Committeeof the Red Cross is being advised of their detention, and will have the opportunity to meetwith them. Those charged with crimes will be given access to attorneys who will help themprepare their defense -- and they will be presumed innocent. While at Guantanamo, they willhave access to the same food, clothing, medical care, and opportunities for worship as otherdetainees. They will be questioned subject to the new U.S. Army Field Manual, which theDepartment of Defense is issuing today. And they will continue to be treated with thehumanity that they denied others. As we move forward with the prosecutions, we will continue to urge nations across the worldto take back their nationals at Guantanamo who will not be prosecuted by our militarycommissions. America has no interest in being the world's jailer. But one of the reasons wehave not been able to close Guantanamo is that many countries have refused to take backtheir nationals held at the facility. Other countries have not provided adequate assurancesthat their nationals will not be mistreated -- or they will not return to the battlefield, as morethan a dozen people released from Guantanamo already have. We will continue working totransfer individuals held at Guantanamo, and ask other countries to work with us in thisprocess. And we will move toward the day when we can eventually close the detention facilityat Guantanamo Bay. I know Americans have heard conflicting information about Guantanamo. Let me give yousome facts. Of the thousands of terrorists captured across the world, only about 770 haveever been sent to Guantanamo. Of these, about 315 have been returned to other countries sofar -- and about 455 remain in our custody. They are provided the same quality of medicalcare as the American service members who guard them. The International Committee of theRed Cross has the opportunity to meet privately with all who are held there. The facility hasbeen visited by government officials from more than 30 countries, and delegations frominternational organizations, as well. After the Organization for Security and Cooperation inEurope came to visit, one of its delegation members called Guantanamo ""a model prison""where people are treated better than in prisons in his own country. Our troops can take greatpride in the work they do at Guantanamo Bay -- and so can the American people. As we prosecute suspected terrorist leaders and operatives who have now been transferred toGuantanamo, we'll continue searching for those who have stepped forward to take theirplaces. This nation is going to stay on the offense to protect the American people. We willcontinue to bring the world's most dangerous terrorists to justice -- and we will continueworking to collect the vital intelligence we need to protect our country.The current transfers mean that there are now no terrorists in the CIA program. But as morehigh-ranking terrorists are captured, the need to obtain intelligence from them will remaincritical -- and having a CIA program for questioning terrorists will continue to be crucial togetting life-saving information. Some may ask: Why are you acknowledging this program now? There are two reasons whyI'm making these limited disclosures today. First, we have largely completed our questioningof the men -- and to start the process for bringing them to trial, we must bring them into theopen. Second, the Supreme Court's recent decision has impaired our ability to prosecuteterrorists through military commissions, and has put in question the future of the CIAprogram. In its ruling on military commissions, the Court determined that a provision of theGeneva Conventions known as ""Common Article Three"" applies to our war with al Qaeda. Thisarticle includes provisions that prohibit ""outrages upon personal dignity"" and ""humiliating anddegrading treatment."" The problem is that these and other provisions of Common ArticleThree are vague and undefined, and each could be interpreted in different ways by Americanor foreign judges. And some believe our military and intelligence personnel involved incapturing and questioning terrorists could now be at risk of prosecution under the War CrimesAct -- simply for doing their jobs in a thorough and professional way. This is unacceptable. Our military and intelligence personnel go face to face with the world'smost dangerous men every day. They have risked their lives to capture some of the mostbrutal terrorists on Earth. And they have worked day and night to find out what the terroristsknow so we can stop new attacks. America owes our brave men and women some things inreturn. We owe them their thanks for saving lives and keeping America safe. And we owethem clear rules, so they can continue to do their jobs and protect our people. So today, I'm asking Congress to pass legislation that will clarify the rules for our personnelfighting the war on terror. First, I'm asking Congress to list the specific, recognizable offensesthat would be considered crimes under the War Crimes Act -- so our personnel can knowclearly what is prohibited in the handling of terrorist enemies. Second, I'm asking thatCongress make explicit that by following the standards of the Detainee Treatment Act ourpersonnel are fulfilling America's obligations under Common Article Three of the GenevaConventions. Third, I'm asking that Congress make it clear that captured terrorists cannot usethe Geneva Conventions as a basis to sue our personnel in courts -- in U.S. courts. The menand women who protect us should not have to fear lawsuits filed by terrorists because they'redoing their jobs.The need for this legislation is urgent. We need to ensure that those questioning terrorists cancontinue to do everything within the limits of the law to get information that can saveAmerican lives. My Administration will continue to work with the Congress to get thislegislation enacted -- but time is of the essence. Congress is in session just for a few moreweeks, and passing this legislation ought to be the top priority. As we work with Congress to pass a good bill, we will also consult with congressional leaderson how to ensure that the CIA program goes forward in a way that follows the law, that meetsthe national security needs of our country, and protects the brave men and women we ask toobtain information that will save innocent lives. For the sake of our security, Congress needsto act, and update our laws to meet the threats of this new era. And I know they will. We're engaged in a global struggle -- and the entire civilized world has a stake in its outcome.America is a nation of law. And as I work with Congress to strengthen and clarify our lawshere at home, I will continue to work with members of the international community who havebeen our partners in this struggle. I've spoken with leaders of foreign governments, andworked with them to address their concerns about Guantanamo and our detention policies. I'llcontinue to work with the international community to construct a common foundation todefend our nations and protect our freedoms. Free nations have faced new enemies and adjusted to new threats before -- and we haveprevailed. Like the struggles of the last century, today's war on terror is, above all, a strugglefor freedom and liberty. The adversaries are different, but the stakes in this war are thesame: We're fighting for our way of life, and our ability to live in freedom. We're fighting forthe cause of humanity, against those who seek to impose the darkness of tyranny and terrorupon the entire world. And we're fighting for a peaceful future for our children and ourgrandchildren. May God bless you all.",bush
"memory. Nineteen men attacked us with a barbarity unequaled in our history. They murderedpeople of all colors, creeds, and nationalities -- and made war upon the entire free world.Since that day, America and her allies have taken the offensive in a war unlike any we havefought before. Today, we are safer, but we are not yet safe. On this solemn night, I've askedfor some of your time to discuss the nature of the threat still before us, what we are doing toprotect our nation, and the building of a more hopeful Middle East that holds the key to peacefor America and the world. On 9/11, our nation saw the face of evil. Yet on that awful day, we also witnessed somethingdistinctly American: ordinary citizens rising to the occasion, and responding with extraordinaryacts of courage. We saw courage in office workers who were trapped on the high floors ofburning skyscrapers -- and called home so that their last words to their families would be ofcomfort and love. We saw courage in passengers aboard Flight 93, who recited the 23rd Psalm-- and then charged the cockpit. And we saw courage in the Pentagon staff who made it out ofthe flames and smoke -- and ran back in to answer cries for help. On this day, we rememberthe innocent who lost their lives -- and we pay tribute to those who gave their lives so thatothers might live.For many of our citizens, the wounds of that morning are still fresh. I've met firefighters andpolice officers who choke up at the memory of fallen comrades. I've stood with familiesgathered on a grassy field in Pennsylvania, who take bittersweet pride in loved ones whorefused to be victims -- and gave America our first victory in the war on terror. I've sat besideyoung mothers with children who are now five years old -- and still long for the daddies whowill never cradle them in their arms. Out of this suffering, we resolve to honor every man andwoman lost. And we seek their lasting memorial in a safer and more hopeful world. Since the horror of 9/11, we've learned a great deal about the enemy. We have learned thatthey are evil and kill without mercy -- but not without purpose. We have learned that theyform a global network of extremists who are driven by a perverted vision of Islam -- atotalitarian ideology that hates freedom, rejects tolerance, and despises all dissent. And wehave learned that their goal is to build a radical Islamic empire where women are prisoners intheir homes, men are beaten for missing prayer meetings, and terrorists have a safe haven toplan and launch attacks on America and other civilized nations. The war against this enemy ismore than a military conflict. It is the decisive ideological struggle of the 21st century, and thecalling of our generation. Our nation is being tested in a way that we have not been since the start of the Cold War. Wesaw what a handful of our enemies can do with box-cutters and plane tickets. We hear theirthreats to launch even more terrible attacks on our people. And we know that if they wereable to get their hands on weapons of mass destruction, they would use them against us. Weface an enemy determined to bring death and suffering into our homes. America did not askfor this war, and every American wishes it were over. So do I. But the war is not over -- and itwill not be over until either we or the extremists emerge victorious. If we do not defeat theseenemies now, we will leave our children to face a Middle East overrun by terrorist states andradical dictators armed with nuclear weapons. We are in a war that will set the course for thisnew century -- and determine the destiny of millions across the world. For America, 9/11 was more than a tragedy -- it changed the way we look at the world. OnSeptember the 11th, we resolved that we would go on the offense against our enemies, andwe would not distinguish between the terrorists and those who harbor or support them. So wehelped drive the Taliban from power in Afghanistan. We put al Qaeda on the run, and killed orcaptured most of those who planned the 9/11 attacks, including the man believed to be themastermind, Khalid Sheik Mohammed.He and other suspected terrorists have been questioned by the Central Intelligence Agency,and they provided valuable information that has helped stop attacks in America and across theworld. Now these men have been transferred to Guantanamo Bay, so they can be held toaccount for their actions. Osama bin Laden and other terrorists are still in hiding. Ourmessage to them is clear: No matter how long it takes, America will find you, and we willbring you to justice. On September the 11th, we learned that America must confront threats before they reach ourshores, whether those threats come from terrorist networks or terrorist states. I'm oftenasked why we're in Iraq when Saddam Hussein was not responsible for the 9/11 attacks. Theanswer is that the regime of Saddam Hussein was a clear threat. My administration, theCongress, and the United Nations saw the threat -- and after 9/11, Saddam's regime posed arisk that the world could not afford to take. The world is safer because Saddam Hussein is nolonger in power. And now the challenge is to help the Iraqi people build a democracy thatfulfills the dreams of the nearly 12 million Iraqis who came out to vote in free elections lastDecember. Al Qaeda and other extremists from across the world have come to Iraq to stop the rise of afree society in the heart of the Middle East. They have joined the remnants of Saddam'sregime and other armed groups to foment sectarian violence and drive us out. Our enemies inIraq are tough and they are committed -- but so are Iraqi and coalition forces. We're adaptingto stay ahead of the enemy, and we are carrying out a clear plan to ensure that a democraticIraq succeeds. We're training Iraqi troops so they can defend their nation. We're helping Iraq's unitygovernment grow in strength and serve its people. We will not leave until this work is done.Whatever mistakes have been made in Iraq, the worst mistake would be to think that if wepulled out, the terrorists would leave us alone. They will not leave us alone. They will followus. The safety of America depends on the outcome of the battle in the streets of Baghdad.Osama bin Laden calls this fight ""the Third World War"" -- and he says that victory for theterrorists in Iraq will mean America's ""defeat and disgrace forever."" If we yield Iraq to menlike bin Laden, our enemies will be emboldened; they will gain a new safe haven; they will useIraq's resources to fuel their extremist movement. We will not allow this to happen. Americawill stay in the fight. Iraq will be a free nation, and a strong ally in the war on terror.We can be confident that our coalition will succeed because the Iraqi people have beensteadfast in the face of unspeakable violence. And we can be confident in victory because ofthe skill and resolve of America's Armed Forces. Every one of our troops is a volunteer, andsince the attacks of September the 11th, more than 1.6 million Americans have steppedforward to put on our nation's uniform. In Iraq, Afghanistan, and other fronts in the war onterror, the men and women of our military are making great sacrifices to keep us safe. Somehave suffered terrible injuries -- and nearly 3,000 have given their lives. America cherishestheir memory. We pray for their families. And we will never back down from the work theyhave begun. We also honor those who toil day and night to keep our homeland safe, and we are givingthem the tools they need to protect our people. We've created the Department of HomelandSecurity. We have torn down the wall that kept law enforcement and intelligence from sharinginformation. We've tightened security at our airports and seaports and borders, and we'vecreated new programs to monitor enemy bank records and phone calls. Thanks to the hardwork of our law enforcement and intelligence professionals, we have broken up terrorist cellsin our midst and saved American lives. Five years after 9/11, our enemies have not succeeded in launching another attack on oursoil, but they've not been idle. Al Qaeda and those inspired by its hateful ideology havecarried out terrorist attacks in more than two dozen nations. And just last month, they werefoiled in a plot to blow up passenger planes headed for the United States. They remaindetermined to attack America and kill our citizens -- and we are determined to stop them.We'll continue to give the men and women who protect us every resource and legal authoritythey need to do their jobs. In the first days after the 9/11 attacks I promised to use every element of national power tofight the terrorists, wherever we find them. One of the strongest weapons in our arsenal is thepower of freedom. The terrorists fear freedom as much as they do our firepower. They arethrown into panic at the sight of an old man pulling the election lever, girls enrolling inschools, or families worshiping God in their own traditions. They know that given a choice,people will choose freedom over their extremist ideology. So their answer is to deny peoplethis choice by raging against the forces of freedom and moderation. This struggle has beencalled a clash of civilizations.In truth, it is a struggle for civilization. We are fighting to maintain the way of life enjoyed byfree nations. And we're fighting for the possibility that good and decent people across theMiddle East can raise up societies based on freedom and tolerance and personal dignity. We are now in the early hours of this struggle between tyranny and freedom. Amid theviolence, some question whether the people of the Middle East want their freedom, andwhether the forces of moderation can prevail. For 60 years, these doubts guided our policiesin the Middle East. And then, on a bright September morning, it became clear that the calmwe saw in the Middle East was only a mirage. Years of pursuing stability to promote peace hadleft us with neither. So we changed our policies, and committed America's influence in theworld to advancing freedom and democracy as the great alternatives to repression andradicalism. With our help, the people of the Middle East are now stepping forward to claim their freedom.From Kabul to Baghdad to Beirut, there are brave men and women risking their lives each dayfor the same freedoms that we enjoy. And they have one question for us: Do we have theconfidence to do in the Middle East what our fathers and grandfathers accomplished in Europeand Asia? By standing with democratic leaders and reformers, by giving voice to the hopes ofdecent men and women, we're offering a path away from radicalism. And we are enlisting themost powerful force for peace and moderation in the Middle East: the desire of millions to befree. Across the broader Middle East, the extremists are fighting to prevent such a future. YetAmerica has confronted evil before, and we have defeated it -- sometimes at the cost ofthousands of good men in a single battle. When Franklin Roosevelt vowed to defeat twoenemies across two oceans, he could not have foreseen D-Day and Iwo Jima -- but he wouldnot have been surprised at the outcome. When Harry Truman promised American support forfree peoples resisting Soviet aggression, he could not have foreseen the rise of the Berlin Wall-- but he would not have been surprised to see it brought down. Throughout our history,America has seen liberty challenged, and every time, we have seen liberty triumph withsacrifice and determination.At the start of this young century, America looks to the day when the people of the MiddleEast leave the desert of despotism for the fertile gardens of liberty, and resume their rightfulplace in a world of peace and prosperity. We look to the day when the nations of that regionrecognize their greatest resource is not the oil in the ground, but the talent and creativity oftheir people. We look to the day when moms and dads throughout the Middle East see afuture of hope and opportunity for their children. And when that good day comes, the cloudsof war will part, the appeal of radicalism will decline, and we will leave our children with abetter and safer world. On this solemn anniversary, we rededicate ourselves to this cause. Our nation has enduredtrials, and we face a difficult road ahead. Winning this war will require the determined effortsof a unified country, and we must put aside our differences and work together to meet thetest that history has given us. We will defeat our enemies. We will protect our people. And wewill lead the 21st century into a shining age of human liberty. Earlier this year, I traveled to the United States Military Academy. I was there to deliver thecommencement address to the first class to arrive at West Point after the attacks ofSeptember the 11th. That day I met a proud mom named RoseEllen Dowdell. She was thereto watch her son, Patrick, accept his commission in the finest Army the world has ever known.A few weeks earlier, RoseEllen had watched her other son, James, graduate from the FireAcademy in New York City. On both these days, her thoughts turned to someone who was notthere to share the moment: her husband, Kevin Dowdell. Kevin was one of the 343 firefighterswho rushed to the burning towers of the World Trade Center on September the 11th -- andnever came home. His sons lost their father that day, but not the passion for service heinstilled in them. Here is what RoseEllen says about her boys: ""As a mother, I cross myfingers and pray all the time for their safety -- but as worried as I am, I'm also proud, and Iknow their dad would be, too."" Our nation is blessed to have young Americans like these -- and we will need them.Dangerous enemies have declared their intention to destroy our way of life. They're not thefirst to try, and their fate will be the same as those who tried before. Nine-Eleven showed uswhy.  The attacks were meant to bring us to our knees, and they did, but not in the way theterrorists intended.Americans united in prayer, came to the aid of neighbors in need, and resolved that ourenemies would not have the last word. The spirit of our people is the source of America'sstrength. And we go forward with trust in that spirit, confidence in our purpose, and faith in aloving God who made us to be free. Thank you, and may God bless you.",bush
"President Bush: Good afternoon, and welcome to the White House. Earlier today Iannounced my intent to nominate Robert Gates to be the next Secretary of the Defense. Andnow I'm pleased to introduce him to the American people. I also am looking forward to payingtribute to the man he will succeed. America remains a nation at war. We face brutal enemies who despise our freedom and wantto destroy our way of life. These enemies attacked our country on September the 11th, 2001;they fight us in Afghanistan and Iraq, and they remain determined to attack our countryagain. Against such enemies, there's only one way to protect the American people: We muststay on the offense and bring our enemies to justice before they hurt us again. In this time of war, the President relies on the Secretary of Defense to provide military adviceand direct our nation's Armed Forces as they engage our enemies across the world. TheSecretary of Defense must be a man of vision who can see threats still over the horizon, andprepare our nation to meet them. Bob Gates is the right man to meet both of these criticalchallenges.Bob is one of our nation's most accomplished public servants. He joined the CIA in 1966, andhas nearly 27 years of national security experience, serving six Presidents of both politicalparties. He spent nearly nine years serving on the National Security Council staff. And at theCIA, he rose from an entry-level employee to become the Director of the Central Intelligence.And his experience has prepared him well for this new assignment. Bob understands the challenges we face in Afghanistan. As President Reagan's DeputyDirector of Central Intelligence, he helped lead America's efforts to drive Soviet forces fromAfghanistan. Success in these efforts weakened the Soviet regime and helped hastenfreedom's victory in the Cold War. Bob understands the challenges facing our nation in Iraq. He served as Deputy NationalSecurity Advisor to the first President Bush during Operation Desert Storm as American troopsrepelled Iraqi aggression and drove Saddam Hussein's forces from Kuwait. More recently, heserved as a member of the Iraq Study Group, a distinguished independent panel ofRepublicans and Democrats led by former Secretary of State Jim Baker and formerCongressman Lee Hamilton. As part of this commission, he has traveled to Iraq and met withthe country's leaders and our military commanders on the ground. He'll provide thedepartment with a fresh perspective and new ideas on how America can achieve our goals inIraq. Bob understands how to lead large, complex institutions and transform them to meet newchallenges. As Director of Central Intelligence, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, hewas responsible for leading all the foreign intelligence agencies of the United States. And he'sbrought that same leadership and abilities as his work as President of our nation's sixthlargest university, Texas A&M. When the A&M board of regents interviewed him for the job, hedescribed himself as an agent of change. As president, he delivered on that promise, initiatingwide-ranging reforms to almost every aspect of campus life. He'll bring that sametransformational spirit to his work in the Department of Defense. Bob Gates is a patriot whose love for country was nurtured in the Kansas community where hewas raised. He's worn our nation's uniform. He's a strategic thinker who was educated atthree of America's finest universities, receiving his bachelor's degree from William & Mary, amaster's degree in history from Indiana University, and a doctorate in Russian and Soviethistory from Georgetown.He's a leader in the business community who served on the boards of several majorcorporations. He's a man of integrity, candor and sound judgment. He knows that thechallenge of protecting our country is larger than any political party, and he has a record ofworking with leaders of both sides of the aisle to strengthen our national security. He has myconfidence and my trust, and he will be an outstanding Secretary of Defense. Bob follows in the footsteps of one of America's most skilled and capable national securityleaders, Donald Rumsfeld. Don is the longest-serving member of my Cabinet, and next monthhe will reach another milestone when he becomes the longest-serving Secretary of Defense inthe history of our nation. I appreciate his willingness to continue serving until his successor isin place, because in a time of war, our nation cannot be without a strong and steady handleading our Department of Defense. Don has served in times of great consequence for our nation. Few will forget the image of DonRumsfeld as he helped rescue workers carry the victims from the rubble of the Pentagon onSeptember the 11th, 2001. In the weeks that followed, he directed the effort to plan ournation's military response to an unprecedented attack on our soil. Under his leadership, U.S.and coalition forces launched one of the most innovative military campaigns in the history ofmodern warfare, driving the Taliban and its al Qaeda allies from power in a matter of weeks. In 2003, on my orders, he led the planning and execution of another historic militarycampaign, Operation Iraqi Freedom, that drove Saddam Hussein from power and helped theIraqi people establish a constitutional democracy in the heart of the Middle East. History willrecord that on Don Rumsfeld's watch, the men and women of our military overthrew twoterrorist regimes, liberated some 50 million people, brought justice to the terrorist Zarqawiand scores of senior al Qaeda operatives, and helped stop new terrorist attacks on our people. America is safer and the world is more secure because of the service and the leadership ofDonald Rumsfeld. As he led the Pentagon in an unprecedented war, Don never took his eye offanother vital responsibility, preparing America for the threats that await us as this newcentury unfolds. He developed a new defense strategy. He established a new NorthernCommand to protect the homeland, a new Joint Forces Command to focus on transformation,a new Strategic Command to defend against long-range attack, and transformed the U.S.Special Operations Command for the war on terror.He led our efforts to create a new NATO Response Force that allows NATO to deploy rapidlyanywhere in the world. He undertook the most sweeping transformation of America's globalforce posture since the end of World War II. He revitalized America's efforts to develop anddeploy ballistic missile defenses, and led a comprehensive review of America's nuclear forcesthat has allowed us to undertake dramatic reductions in offensive nuclear weapons. Don's work in these areas did not often make the headlines. But the reforms that he has set inmotion are historic, and they will enhance the security of the American people for decades tocome. Over the past six years, I've relied on Don Rumsfeld's advice and counsel. I've come to knowhis character and his integrity. As the Secretary of Defense, he has been dedicated to hismission, loyal to his President, and devoted to the courageous men and women of our ArmedForces. Don once famously said, ""There are known knowns; there are known unknowns; and thereare unknown unknowns."" Well, Mr. Secretary, here is a known known: Your service has madeAmerica stronger, and made America a safer nation. You will be missed, and I wish you andJoyce all the best in the years to come. Don Rumsfeld is a tough act to follow. That's why I picked a man of Bob Gates's caliber tosucceed him. When confirmed by the Senate, Bob will bring talent, energy and innovation tothe Department of Defense. He'll work every day to keep the American people safe and tomake our nation more secure. And he'll do a superb job as America's next Secretary ofDefense. Bob, I appreciate you agreeing to serve our nation again, and congratulations. Robert Gates: Thank you, sir. Mr. President, thank you for this high honor and for yourconfidence. And let me add my thanks to Secretary Rumsfeld for his service. I entered publicservice 40 years ago last August. President Bush will be the seventh President I have served. Ihad not anticipated returning to government service, and have never enjoyed any positionmore than being president of Texas A&M University. However, the United States is at war, inIraq and Afghanistan. We're fighting against terrorism worldwide.And we face other serious challenges to peace and our security. I believe the outcome ofthese conflicts will shape our world for decades to come. Because our long-term strategicinterests and our national and homeland security are at risk, because so many of America'ssons and daughters in our Armed Forces are in harm's way, I did not hesitate when thePresident asked me to return to duty. If confirmed by the Senate, I will serve with all my heart, and with gratitude to the Presidentfor giving me the opportunity to do so. Secretary Rumsfeld: Bob Gates, my congratulations to you on this nomination. My very bestwishes. Look forward to working with you in the transition. Mr. President, thank you for your kind words, and the wholly unexpected opportunity youprovided me to serve in the Department of Defense again these past years -- six years. It'sbeen quite a time. It recalls to mind the statement by Winston Churchill, something to theeffect that ""I have benefited greatly from criticism, and at no time have I suffered a lackthereof.""The great respect that I have for your leadership, Mr. President, in this little understood,unfamiliar war, the first war of the 21st century -- it is not well-known, it was not well-understood, it is complex for people to comprehend. And I know, with certainty, that overtime the contributions you've made will be recorded by history. I must say that it's been the highest honor of my life to serve with the talented men andwomen of the Department of Defense, the amazing men and women -- young men andwomen in uniform. It's a privilege. And their patriotism, their professionalism, their dedicationis truly an inspiration. They have my respect; they will remain in my prayers always. Thank you.",bush
"Thank you very much. And tonight, I have a high privilege and distinct honor of my own -- asthe first President to begin the State of the Union message with these words: MadamSpeaker. In his day, the late Congressman Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr. from Baltimore, Maryland, sawPresidents Roosevelt and Truman at this rostrum. But nothing could compare with the sight ofhis only daughter, Nancy, presiding tonight as Speaker of the House of Representatives.Congratulations, Madam Speaker.  Two members of the House and Senate are not with us tonight, and we pray for the recoveryand speedy return of Senator Tim Johnson and Congressman Charlie Norwood.Madam Speaker, Vice President Cheney, members of Congress, distinguished guests, andfellow citizens: The rite of custom brings us together at a defining hour -- when decisions are hard andcourage is needed. We enter the year 2007 with large endeavors underway, and others thatare ours to begin. In all of this, much is asked of us. We must have the will to face difficultchallenges and determined enemies -- and the wisdom to face them together. Some in this chamber are new to the House and the Senate -- and I congratulate theDemocrat majority. Congress has changed, but not our responsibilities. Each of us is guidedby our own convictions -- and to these we must stay faithful. Yet we're all held to the samestandards, and called to serve the same good purposes: To extend this nation's prosperity; tospend the people's money wisely; to solve problems, not leave them to future generations; toguard America against all evil; and to keep faith with those we have sent forth to defend us. We're not the first to come here with a government divided and uncertainty in the air. Likemany before us, we can work through our differences, and achieve big things for the Americanpeople. Our citizens don't much care which side of the aisle we sit on -- as long as we'rewilling to cross that aisle when there is work to be done. Our job is to make life better for ourfellow Americans, and to help them to build a future of hope and opportunity -- and this is thebusiness before us tonight. A future of hope and opportunity begins with a growing economy -- and that is what we have.We're now in the 41st month of uninterrupted job growth, in a recovery that has created 7.2million new jobs -- so far. Unemployment is low, inflation is low, and wages are rising. Thiseconomy is on the move, and our job is to keep it that way, not with more government, butwith more enterprise. Next week, I'll deliver a full report on the state of our economy. Tonight, I want to discussthree economic reforms that deserve to be priorities for this Congress. First, we must balance the federal budget. We can do so without raising taxes. What we needto do is impose spending discipline in Washington, D.C. We set a goal of cutting the deficit inhalf by 2009, and met that goal three years ahead of schedule. Now let us take the next step.In the coming weeks, I will submit a budget that eliminates the federal deficit within the nextfive years. I ask you to make the same commitment. Together, we can restrain the spendingappetite of the federal government, and we can balance the federal budget. Next, there is the matter of earmarks. These special interest items are often slipped into billsat the last hour -- when not even C-SPAN is watching. In 2005 alone, the number of earmarksgrew to over 13,000 and totaled nearly $18 billion. Even worse, over 90 percent of earmarksnever make it to the floor of the House and Senate -- they are dropped into committeereports that are not even part of the bill that arrives on my desk. You didn't vote them intolaw. I didn't sign them into law. Yet, they're treated as if they have the force of law. The timehas come to end this practice. So let us work together to reform the budget process, exposeevery earmark to the light of day and to a vote in Congress, and cut the number and cost ofearmarks at least in half by the end of this session. And, finally, to keep this economy strong we must take on the challenge of entitlements.Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid are commitments of conscience, and so it is ourduty to keep them permanently sound. Yet, we're failing in that duty. And this failure will oneday leave our children with three bad options: huge tax increases, huge deficits, or huge andimmediate cuts in benefits. Everyone in this chamber knows this to be true -- yet somehowwe have not found it in ourselves to act. So let us work together and do it now. With enoughgood sense and goodwill, you and I can fix Medicare and Medicaid -- and save Social Security. Spreading opportunity and hope in America also requires public schools that give children theknowledge and character they need in life. Five years ago, we rose above partisan differencesto pass the No Child Left Behind Act, preserving local control, raising standards, and holdingthose schools accountable for results. And because we acted, students are performing betterin reading and math, and minority students are closing the achievement gap. Now the task is to build on the success, without watering down standards, without takingcontrol from local communities, and without backsliding and calling it reform. We can liftstudent achievement even higher by giving local leaders flexibility to turn around failingschools, and by giving families with children stuck in failing schools the right to choosesomeplace better.We must increase funds for students who struggle -- and make sure these children get thespecial help they need. And we can make sure our children are prepared for the jobs of thefuture and our country is more competitive by strengthening math and science skills. The NoChild Left Behind Act has worked for America's children -- and I ask Congress to reauthorizethis good law. A future of hope and opportunity requires that all our citizens have affordable and availablehealth care. When it comes to health care, government has an obligation to care for theelderly, the disabled, and poor children. And we will meet those responsibilities. For all otherAmericans, private health insurance is the best way to meet their needs. But many Americanscannot afford a health insurance policy. And so tonight, I propose two new initiatives to help more Americans afford their owninsurance. First, I propose a standard tax deduction for health insurance that will be like thestandard tax deduction for dependents. Families with health insurance will pay no income onpayroll tax -- or payroll taxes on $15,000 of their income. Single Americans with healthinsurance will pay no income or payroll taxes on $7,500 of their income. With this reform,more than 100 million men, women, and children who are now covered by employer-providedinsurance will benefit from lower tax bills. At the same time, this reform will level the playingfield for those who do not get health insurance through their job. For Americans who nowpurchase health insurance on their own, this proposal would mean a substantial tax savings --$4,500 for a family of four making $60,000 a year. And for the millions of other Americanswho have no health insurance at all, this deduction would help put a basic private healthinsurance plan within their reach. Changing the tax code is a vital and necessary step tomaking health care affordable for more Americans. My second proposal is to help the states that are coming up with innovative ways to cover theuninsured. States that make basic private health insurance available to all their citizens shouldreceive federal funds to help them provide this coverage to the poor and the sick. I haveasked the Secretary of Health and Human Services to work with Congress to take existingfederal funds and use them to create ""Affordable Choices"" grants. These grants would give ournation's governors more money and more flexibility to get private health insurance to thosemost in need.There are many other ways that Congress can help. We need to expand Health SavingsAccounts. We need to help small businesses through Association Health Plans. We need toreduce costs and medical errors with better information technology. We will encourage pricetransparency. And to protect good doctors from junk lawsuits, we passing medical liabilityreform. In all we do, we must remember that the best health care decisions are made not bygovernment and insurance companies, but by patients and their doctors.Extending hope and opportunity in our country requires an immigration system worthy ofAmerica -- with laws that are fair and borders that are secure. When laws and borders areroutinely violated, this harms the interests of our country. To secure our border, we'redoubling the size of the Border Patrol, and funding new infrastructure and technology. Yet even with all these steps, we cannot fully secure the border unless we take pressure offthe border -- and that requires a temporary worker program. We should establish a legal andorderly path for foreign workers to enter our country to work on a temporary basis. As aresult, they won't have to try to sneak in, and that will leave Border Agents free to chasedown drug smugglers and criminals and terrorists. We'll enforce our immigration laws at thework site and give employers the tools to verify the legal status of their workers, so there's noexcuse left for violating the law.We need to uphold the great tradition of the melting pot that welcomes and assimilates newarrivals. We need to resolve the status of the illegal immigrants who are already in ourcountry without animosity and without amnesty. Convictions run deep in this Capitol when itcomes to immigration. Let us have a serious, civil, and conclusive debate, so that you canpass, and I can sign, comprehensive immigration reform into law.Extending hope and opportunity depends on a stable supply of energy that keeps America'seconomy running and America's environment clean. For too long our nation has beendependent on foreign oil. And this dependence leaves us more vulnerable to hostile regimes,and to terrorists -- who could cause huge disruptions of oil shipments, and raise the price ofoil, and do great harm to our economy. It's in our vital interest to diversify America's energy supply -- the way forward is throughtechnology. We must continue changing the way America generates electric power, by evengreater use of clean coal technology, solar and wind energy, and clean, safe nuclear power.We need to press on with battery research for plug-in and hybrid vehicles, and expand the useof clean diesel vehicles and biodiesel fuel. We must continue investing in new methods ofproducing ethanol -- using everything from wood chips to grasses, to agricultural wastes. We made a lot of progress, thanks to good policies here in Washington and the strongresponse of the market. And now even more dramatic advances are within reach. Tonight, Iask Congress to join me in pursuing a great goal. Let us build on the work we've done andreduce gasoline usage in the United States by 20 percent in the next 10 years. When we dothat we will have cut our total imports by the equivalent of three-quarters of all the oil we nowimport from the Middle East. To reach this goal, we must increase the supply of alternative fuels, by setting a mandatoryfuels standard to require 35 billion gallons of renewable and alternative fuels in 2017 -- andthat is nearly five times the current target. At the same time, we need to reform andmodernize fuel economy standards for cars the way we did for light trucks -- and conserve upto 8.5 billion more gallons of gasoline by 2017. Achieving these ambitious goals will dramatically reduce our dependence on foreign oil, butit's not going to eliminate it. And so as we continue to diversify our fuel supply, we must stepup domestic oil production in environmentally sensitive ways. And to further protect Americaagainst severe disruptions to our oil supply, I ask Congress to double the current capacity ofthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve. America is on the verge of technological breakthroughs that will enable us to live our lives lessdependent on oil. And these technologies will help us be better stewards of the environment,and they will help us to confront the serious challenge of global climate change. A future of hope and opportunity requires a fair, impartial system of justice. The lives of ourcitizens across our nation are affected by the outcome of cases pending in our federal courts.We have a shared obligation to ensure that the federal courts have enough judges to hearthose cases and deliver timely rulings. As President, I have a duty to nominate qualified menand women to vacancies on the federal bench. And the United States Senate has a duty, aswell, to give those nominees a fair hearing, and a prompt up-or-down vote on the Senatefloor.For all of us in this room, there is no higher responsibility than to protect the people of thiscountry from danger. Five years have come and gone since we saw the scenes and felt thesorrow that the terrorists can cause. We've had time to take stock of our situation. We'veadded many critical protections to guard the homeland. We know with certainty that thehorrors of that September morning were just a glimpse of what the terrorists intend for us --unless we stop them. With the distance of time, we find ourselves debating the causes of conflict and the course wehave followed. Such debates are essential when a great democracy faces great questions. Yetone question has surely been settled: that to win the war on terror we must take the fight tothe enemy. From the start, America and our allies have protected our people by staying on the offense.The enemy knows that the days of comfortable sanctuary, easy movement, steady financing,and free flowing communications are long over. For the terrorists, life since 9/11 has neverbeen the same. Our success in this war is often measured by the things that did not happen. We cannot knowthe full extent of the attacks that we and our allies have prevented, but here is some of whatwe do know: We stopped an al Qaeda plot to fly a hijacked airplane into the tallest building onthe West Coast. We broke up a Southeast Asian terror cell grooming operatives for attacksinside the United States. We uncovered an al Qaeda cell developing anthrax to be used inattacks against America. And just last August, British authorities uncovered a plot to blow uppassenger planes bound for America over the Atlantic Ocean. For each life saved, we owe adebt of gratitude to the brave public servants who devote their lives to finding the terroristsand stopping them.  Every success against the terrorists is a reminder of the shoreless ambitions of this enemy.The evil that inspired and rejoiced in 9/11 is still at work in the world. And so long as that'sthe case, America is still a nation at war. In the mind of the terrorist, this war began well before September the 11th, and will not enduntil their radical vision is fulfilled. And these past five years have given us a much clearerview of the nature of this enemy. Al Qaeda and its followers are Sunni extremists, possessedby hatred and commanded by a harsh and narrow ideology.Take almost any principle of civilization, and their goal is the opposite. They preach withthreats, instruct with bullets and bombs, and promise paradise for the murder of the innocent. Our enemies are quite explicit about their intentions. They want to overthrow moderategovernments, and establish safe havens from which to plan and carry out new attacks on ourcountry. By killing and terrorizing Americans, they want to force our country to retreat fromthe world and abandon the cause of liberty. They would then be free to impose their will andspread their totalitarian ideology. Listen to this warning from the late terrorist Zarqawi: ""Wewill sacrifice our blood and bodies to put an end to your dreams, and what is coming is evenworse."" Osama bin Laden declared: ""Death is better than living on this Earth with theunbelievers among us."" These men are not given to idle words, and they are just one camp in the Islamist radicalmovement. In recent times, it has also become clear that we face an escalating danger fromShia extremists who are just as hostile to America, and are also determined to dominate theMiddle East. Many are known to take direction from the regime in Iran, which is funding andarming terrorists like Hezbollah -- a group second only to al Qaeda in the American lives it hastaken. The Shia and Sunni extremists are different faces of the same totalitarian threat. Whateverslogans they chant, when they slaughter the innocent they have the same wicked purposes.They want to kill Americans, kill democracy in the Middle East, and gain the weapons to kill onan even more horrific scale. In the sixth year since our nation was attacked, I wish I could report to you that the dangershad ended. They have not. And so it remains the policy of this government to use every lawfuland proper tool of intelligence, diplomacy, law enforcement, and military action to do ourduty, to find these enemies, and to protect the American people. This war is more than a clash of arms -- it is a decisive ideological struggle, and the securityof our nation is in the balance. To prevail, we must remove the conditions that inspire blindhatred, and drove 19 men to get onto airplanes and to come and kill us. What every terroristfears most is human freedom -- societies where men and women make their own choices,answer to their own conscience, and live by their hopes instead of their resentments.Free people are not drawn to violent and malignant ideologies -- and most will choose a betterway when they're given a chance. So we advance our own security interests by helpingmoderates and reformers and brave voices for democracy. The great question of our day iswhether America will help men and women in the Middle East to build free societies and sharein the rights of all humanity. And I say, for the sake of our own security, we must. In the last two years, we've seen the desire for liberty in the broader Middle East -- and wehave been sobered by the enemy's fierce reaction. In 2005, the world watched as the citizensof Lebanon raised the banner of the Cedar Revolution, they drove out the Syrian occupiersand chose new leaders in free elections. In 2005, the people of Afghanistan defied theterrorists and elected a democratic legislature. And in 2005, the Iraqi people held threenational elections, choosing a transitional government, adopting the most progressive,democratic constitution in the Arab world, and then electing a government under thatconstitution. Despite endless threats from the killers in their midst, nearly 12 million Iraqicitizens came out to vote in a show of hope and solidarity that we should never forget.A thinking enemy watched all of these scenes, adjusted their tactics, and in 2006 they struckback. In Lebanon, assassins took the life of Pierre Gemayel, a prominent participant in theCedar Revolution. Hezbollah terrorists, with support from Syria and Iran, sowed conflict in theregion and are seeking to undermine Lebanon's legitimately elected government. InAfghanistan, Taliban and al Qaeda fighters tried to regain power by regrouping and engagingAfghan and NATO forces. In Iraq, al Qaeda and other Sunni extremists blew up one of themost sacred places in Shia Islam -- the Golden Mosque of Samarra. This atrocity, directed at aMuslim house of prayer, was designed to provoke retaliation from Iraqi Shia -- and itsucceeded. Radical Shia elements, some of whom receive support from Iran, formed deathsquads. The result was a tragic escalation of sectarian rage and reprisal that continues to thisday. This is not the fight we entered in Iraq, but it is the fight we're in. Every one of us wishes thiswar were over and won. Yet it would not be like us to leave our promises unkept, our friendsabandoned, and our own security at risk. Ladies and gentlemen: On this day, at this hour, it isstill within our power to shape the outcome of this battle. Let us find our resolve, and turnevents toward victory.We're carrying out a new strategy in Iraq -- a plan that demands more from Iraq's electedgovernment, and gives our forces in Iraq the reinforcements they need to complete theirmission. Our goal is a democratic Iraq that upholds the rule of law, respects the rights of itspeople, provides them security, and is an ally in the war on terror. In order to make progress toward this goal, the Iraqi government must stop the sectarianviolence in its capital. But the Iraqis are not yet ready to do this on their own. So we'redeploying reinforcements of more than 20,000 additional soldiers and Marines to Iraq. Thevast majority will go to Baghdad, where they will help Iraqi forces to clear and secureneighborhoods, and serve as advisers embedded in Iraqi Army units. With Iraqis in the lead,our forces will help secure the city by chasing down the terrorists, insurgents, and theroaming death squads. And in Anbar Province, where al Qaeda terrorists have gathered andlocal forces have begun showing a willingness to fight them, we're sending an additional 4,000United States Marines, with orders to find the terrorists and clear them out. We didn't drive alQaeda out of their safe haven in Afghanistan only to let them set up a new safe haven in afree Iraq. The people of Iraq want to live in peace, and now it's time for their government to act. Iraq'sleaders know that our commitment is not open-ended. They have promised to deploy more oftheir own troops to secure Baghdad -- and they must do so. They pledged that they willconfront violent radicals of any faction or political party -- and they need to follow through,and lift needless restrictions on Iraqi and coalition forces, so these troops can achieve theirmission of bringing security to all of the people of Baghdad. Iraq's leaders have committedthemselves to a series of benchmarks -- to achieve reconciliation, to share oil revenuesamong all of Iraq's citizens, to put the wealth of Iraq into the rebuilding of Iraq, to allow moreIraqis to re-enter their nation's civic life, to hold local elections, and to take responsibility forsecurity in every Iraqi province. But for all of this to happen, Baghdad must be secure. Andour plan will help the Iraqi government take back its capital and make good on itscommitments. My fellow citizens, our military commanders and I have carefully weighed the options. Wediscussed every possible approach. In the end, I chose this course of action because itprovides the best chance for success. Many in this chamber understand that America must notfail in Iraq, because you understand that the consequences of failure would be grievous andfar-reaching.If American forces step back before Baghdad is secure, the Iraqi government would beoverrun by extremists on all sides. We could expect an epic battle between Shia extremistsbacked by Iran, and Sunni extremists aided by al Qaeda and supporters of the old regime. Acontagion of violence could spill out across the country -- and in time, the entire region couldbe drawn into the conflict. For America, this is a nightmare scenario. For the enemy, this is the objective. Chaos is thegreatest ally -- their greatest ally in this struggle. And out of chaos in Iraq would emerge anemboldened enemy with new safe havens, new recruits, new resources, and an even greaterdetermination to harm America. To allow this to happen would be to ignore the lessons ofSeptember the 11th and invite tragedy. Ladies and gentlemen, nothing is more important atthis moment in our history than for America to succeed in the Middle East, to succeed in Iraqand to spare the American people from this danger. This is where matters stand tonight, in the here and now. I have spoken with many of you inperson. I respect you and the arguments you've made. We went into this largely united, in ourassumptions and in our convictions. And whatever you voted for, you did not vote for failure.Our country is pursuing a new strategy in Iraq, and I ask you to give it a chance to work. AndI ask you to support our troops in the field, and those on their way.The war on terror we fight today is a generational struggle that will continue long after youand I have turned our duties over to others. And that's why it's important to work together soour nation can see this great effort through. Both parties and both branches should work inclose consultation. It's why I propose to establish a special advisory council on the war onterror, made up of leaders in Congress from both political parties. We will share ideas for howto position America to meet every challenge that confronts us. We'll show our enemies abroadthat we are united in the goal of victory. And one of the first steps we can take together is to add to the ranks of our military so thatthe American Armed Forces are ready for all the challenges ahead. Tonight I ask the Congressto authorize an increase in the size of our active Army and Marine Corps by 92,000 in the nextfive years. A second task we can take on together is to design and establish a volunteerCivilian Reserve Corps. Such a corps would function much like our military reserve.It would ease the burden on the Armed Forces by allowing us to hire civilians with critical skillsto serve on missions abroad when America needs them. It would give people across Americawho do not wear the uniform a chance to serve in the defining struggle of our time. Americans can have confidence in the outcome of this struggle because we're not in thisstruggle alone. We have a diplomatic strategy that is rallying the world to join in the fightagainst extremism. In Iraq, multinational forces are operating under a mandate from theUnited Nations. We're working with Jordan and Saudi Arabia and Egypt and the Gulf States toincrease support for Iraq's government. The United Nations has imposed sanctions on Iran, and made it clear that the world will notallow the regime in Tehran to acquire nuclear weapons. With the other members of theQuartet -- the U.N., the European Union, and Russia -- we're pursuing diplomacy to help bringpeace to the Holy Land, and pursuing the establishment of a democratic Palestinian stateliving side-by-side with Israel in peace and security. In Afghanistan, NATO has taken the leadin turning back the Taliban and al Qaeda offensive -- the first time the Alliance has deployedforces outside the North Atlantic area. Together with our partners in China, Japan, Russia, andSouth Korea, we're pursuing intensive diplomacy to achieve a Korean Peninsula free of nuclearweapons. We will continue to speak out for the cause of freedom in places like Cuba, Belarus, andBurma -- and continue to awaken the conscience of the world to save the people of Darfur. American foreign policy is more than a matter of war and diplomacy. Our work in the world isalso based on a timeless truth: To whom much is given, much is required. We hear the call totake on the challenges of hunger and poverty and disease -- and that is precisely whatAmerica is doing. We must continue to fight HIV/AIDS, especially on the continent of Africa.Because you funded our Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the number of people receiving life-saving drugs has grown from 50,000 to more than 800,000 in three short years. I ask you tocontinue funding our efforts to fight HIV/AIDS. I ask you to provide $1.2 billion over five yearsso we can combat malaria in 15 African countries. I ask that you fund the Millennium Challenge Account, so that American aid reaches thepeople who need it, in nations where democracy is on the rise and corruption is in retreat.And let us continue to support the expanded trade and debt relief that are the best hope forlifting lives and eliminating poverty.When America serves others in this way, we show the strength and generosity of our country.These deeds reflect the character of our people. The greatest strength we have is the heroickindness, courage, and self-sacrifice of the American people. You see this spirit often if youknow where to look -- and tonight we need only look above to the gallery. Dikembe Mutombo grew up in Africa, amid great poverty and disease. He came to GeorgetownUniversity on a scholarship to study medicine -- but Coach John Thompson got a look atDikembe and had a different idea. Dikembe became a star in the NBA, and a citizen of theUnited States. But he never forgot the land of his birth, or the duty to share his blessings withothers. He built a brand new hospital in his old hometown. A friend has said of this good-hearted man: ""Mutombo believes that God has given him this opportunity to do great things.""And we are proud to call this son of the Congo a citizen of the United States of America. After her daughter was born, Julie Aigner-Clark searched for ways to share her love of musicand art with her child. So she borrowed some equipment, and began filming children's videosin her basement. The Baby Einstein Company was born, and in just five years her businessgrew to more than $20 million in sales. In November 2001, Julie sold Baby Einstein to theWalt Disney Company, and with her help Baby Einstein has grown into a $200 millionbusiness. Julie represents the great enterprising spirit of America. And she is using hersuccess to help others -- producing child safety videos with John Walsh of the National Centerfor Missing and Exploited Children. Julie says of her new project: ""I believe it's the mostimportant thing that I have ever done. I believe that children have the right to live in a worldthat is safe."" And so tonight, we are pleased to welcome this talented business entrepreneurand generous social entrepreneur -- Julie Aigner-Clark. Three weeks ago, Wesley Autrey was waiting at a Harlem subway station with his two littlegirls, when he saw a man fall into the path of a train. With seconds to act, Wesley jumpedonto the tracks, pulled the man into the space between the rails, and held him as the trainpassed right above their heads. He insists he's not a hero. He says: ""We got guys and girlsoverseas dying for us to have our freedoms. We have got to show each other some love.""There is something wonderful about a country that produces a brave and humble man likeWesley Autrey.Tommy Rieman was a teenager pumping gas in Independence, Kentucky, when he enlisted inthe United States Army. In December 2003, he was on a reconnaissance mission in Iraq whenhis team came under heavy enemy fire. From his Humvee, Sergeant Rieman returned fire; heused his body as a shield to protect his gunner. He was shot in the chest and arm, andreceived shrapnel wounds to his legs -- yet he refused medical attention, and stayed in thefight. He helped to repel a second attack, firing grenades at the enemy's position. For hisexceptional courage, Sergeant Rieman was awarded the Silver Star. And like so many otherAmericans who have volunteered to defend us, he has earned the respect and the gratitude ofour entire country. In such courage and compassion, ladies and gentlemen, we see the spirit and character ofAmerica -- and these qualities are not in short supply. This is a decent and honorable country-- and resilient, too. We've been through a lot together. We've met challenges and faceddangers, and we know that more lie ahead. Yet we can go forward with confidence -- becausethe State of our Union is strong, our cause in the world is right, and tonight that cause goeson. God bless.See you next year. Thank you for your prayers.",bush
"Governor, thank you. President Steger, thank you very much. Students, and faculty, and staff,and grieving family members, and members of this really extraordinary place.Laura and I have come to Blacksburg today with hearts full of sorrow. This is a day ofmourning for the Virginia Tech community -- and it is a day of sadness for our entire nation.We've come to express our sympathy. In this time of anguish, I hope you know that people allover this country are thinking about you, and asking God to provide comfort for all who havebeen affected.Yesterday began like any other day. Students woke up, and they grabbed their backpacks andthey headed for class. And soon the day took a dark turn, with students and facultybarricading themselves in classrooms and dormitories -- confused, terrified, and deeplyworried. By the end of the morning, it was the worst day of violence on a college campus inAmerican history -- and for many of you here today, it was the worst day of your lives.It's impossible to make sense of such violence and suffering. Those whose lives were takendid nothing to deserve their fate. They were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. Nowthey're gone -- and they leave behind grieving families, and grieving classmates, and agrieving nation. In such times as this, we look for sources of strength to sustain us. And in this moment ofloss, you're finding these sources everywhere around you. These sources of strength are inthis community, this college community. You have a compassionate and resilient communityhere at Virginia Tech. Even as yesterday's events were still unfolding, members of thiscommunity found each other; you came together in dorm rooms and dining halls and onblogs. One recent graduate wrote this: I don't know most of you guys, but we're all Hokies, which means we're family. To allof you who are okay, I'm happy for that. For those of you who are in pain or have lostsomeone close to you, I'm sure you can call on anyone of us and have help any timeyou need it.These sources of strength are with your loved ones. For many of you, your first instinct was tocall home and let your moms and dads know that you were okay. Others took on the terribleduty of calling the relatives of a classmate or a colleague who had been wounded or lost. Iknow many of you feel awfully far away from people you lean on, people you count on duringdifficult times. But as a dad, I can assure you, a parent's love is never far from their child'sheart. And as you draw closer to your own families in the coming days, I ask you to reach outto those who ache for sons and daughters who will never come home. These sources of strength are also in the faith that sustains so many of us. Across the town ofBlacksburg and in towns all across America, houses of worship from every faith have openedtheir doors and have lifted you up in prayer. People who have never met you are praying foryou; they're praying for your friends who have fallen and who are injured. There's a power inthese prayers, real power. In times like this, we can find comfort in the grace and guidance ofa loving God. As the Scriptures tells us, ""Don't be overcome by evil, but overcome evil withgood.""And on this terrible day of mourning, it's hard to imagine that time will come when life atVirginia Tech will return to normal. But such a day will come. And when it does, you willalways remember the friends and teachers who were lost yesterday, and the time you sharedwith them, and the lives they hoped to lead. May God bless you.May God bless and keep the souls of the lost.And may His love touch all those who suffer in grief.",bush
"United States of America, I welcome you in Ramallah, as well as in Bethlehem, on the land ofPalestine, that welcomes you today as a great guest, that goes with him, commitmenttowards the peace process. It's a historic visit that gives our people great hope in the fact thatyour great nation is standing and supporting their dream and their yearning towards freedomand independence and living in peace in this area, alongside their neighbors.  Our people will not forget Your Excellency, your invitation and your commitment towards theestablishment of an independent Palestinian state. You are the first American President thatconfirms and reiterates this right. [Translation earpiece not working.]President Bush: I haven't got it yet. You may have to start over.  Not yet. You better stayawake.President Abbas: Our people, Your Excellency -- President Bush: I agree completely.  President Abbas: Your commitment towards an establishment of an independent Palestinianstate -- you are the first American President to reiterate this right. The conferences ofAnnapolis and Paris were an historic step from you and from the American people and theworld as a whole to perfect this commitment and push it forward. Our Palestinian people, who committed to peace as a strategic option, want to see, throughyour support and your intervention, and end to its suffering and the suffering of its people andtheir families, and wants to move freely in their homeland, and develop their life and theireconomy without any obstacles that hinder that progress, and without a separation wall thatfragments the land, and without settlements that is governing its land and future. We want tosee a different future where prisons are not crowded with thousands of prisoners, and wherehospitals are not crowded with tens of innocent victims every day, without checkpoints andqueues of ordinary people who suffer from humiliation and siege. I would like to point out here that we instructed our government to continue the work towardsenhancing security and imposing public order, and establishing good governance that is basedon the rule of law, and to consolidate the role of our democratic institutions and strengthenthe work of the civil society, as well as work on consolidating development and administrativeand financial reform and transparency, so that we can lay the foundations for a modern anddemocratic state. And the government is taking intensive steps in that direction, and I would like to express ourappreciation for the support of your administration in the economic sphere in order to developthe infrastructure and provide new job opportunities, and improve the level of services and allother projects that contribute in improving the lives and the conditions of living for our people.We and our Israeli neighbors, and under your direct sponsorship -- bilateral negotiations thataddress all issues of final status are core issues -- that we would like to end thesenegotiations during your term in office and that we -- it will be ending by the -- ending of theoccupation that started in 1967, and that establishment of an independent Palestinian state,and its capital, Jerusalem, based on your vision and the international resolutions, and that wefind a fair solution for the tragedy of refugees, according to the Arab initiative for peace andaccording to the U.N. resolutions. And on this occasion I would like to reiterate before you our commitment to all our obligationsthat we agreed to. And we call upon Israel, as well, to fulfill its commitments according to theroad map plan, because we firmly believe that peace is made by a will and a sharedcommitment among all parties. Your historic visit today to the Palestinian Territories is highly appreciated by our people, andit's a new expression of your deep commitment towards establishing peace on the land ofpeace. We appreciate the complete seriousness that characterizes your visit and your effortstoday to continue and build and capitalize on this important opportunity that is available to usand to the Israelis. We start with you a new year, hoping that this will be the year for the creation of peace. Youwill hear today in Bethlehem the call for prayers from the mosques, and the heralding of bellsat the Church of Nativity, that confirms our common message, the message of humantolerance and real peace that is deeply rooted in our conscience and in our heritage. Yourpresence today amongst us, Your Excellency, is a reiteration for the call for comprehensiveand just peace that you called for and you committed yourself to. And the echo of this callreaches all the people and the countries in our region, because the voice that is now going outof Palestine is the closest and the deepest in reaching the hearts of all the people in theregion. Please, Your Excellency, trust that peace in the world starts from here, from the Holy Land.We welcome you again, our dear guest and our dear friend, here in Palestine.President Bush: Mr. President, thank you for your hospitality. We have met a lot in the pastand I'm glad to finally have a chance to sit down in your office to discuss important issues. [Interruption in the translation audio.] Is it working? Listen, they say I have enough problemsspeaking English as it is.I have had numerous opportunities to visit with the President. And the fundamental question Ihave is whether or not he is committed to peace. It's the same question I had for the PrimeMinister of Israel. And I've come to the conclusion that both men understand the importanceto democratic states living side by side in peace. President Abbas was elected on a platform of peace. In other words, he just wasn't somebodywho starts talking about it lately, he campaigned on it. He also said that if you give me achance, I'll work to improve the lives of the average Palestinians, and that's what he hasdone. It's certainly not easy work. The conditions on the ground are very difficult and,nevertheless, this man and his government not only works for a vision, but also works toimprove the lives of the average citizens, which is essential for the emergence of a Palestiniandemocracy. I talked to him today about how -- what we can do to help and, as he mentioned, the UnitedStates has been an active financial giver, we helped at the Paris Conference. I firmly believethat the Palestinians are entrepreneurial people who, if just given a chance, will be able togrow their businesses and provide jobs. We talked about the need to fight off the extremists. The world in which we live is adangerous world because there are people who murder innocent people to achieve politicalobjectives, not just here in this immediate part of the world, but around the world. That'swhat we're dealing with in Iraq and Afghanistan and Lebanon. And the fundamental questionis, will nations stand up and help those who understand the ideological struggle we're in. Andthe President understands the ideological struggle. He knows that a handful of people want todash the aspirations of the Palestinian people by creating chaos and violence.And I appreciate that, Mr. President. And I appreciate your understanding that, ultimately, theway to achieve peace is to offer an alternative vision, and that's a vision based upon liberty. Now, look, there are some in the world who don't believe in the universality of freedom. Iunderstand that. They say, like, freedom is okay for some of us, but maybe not all of us. Iunderstand it, but I reject it. I believe in the universality of freedom. I believe, deep in thesoul of every man, woman, and child on the face of this Earth is the desire to live in a freesociety. And I also believe free societies yield peace. And, therefore, this notion of two statesliving side by side in peace is based upon the universality of freedom, and if given a chance,the Palestinian people will work for freedom. And that's a challenge ahead of us -- is, is it possible for the Israelis and the Palestinians towork out their differences on core issues so that a vision can emerge? And my answer is,absolutely, it's possible. Not only is it possible, it's necessary. And I'm looking forward tohelping. You know, there's a great anticipation that all the American President has got to do is step in,and just say, okay, this is the way it's going to be. That's not how the system works. In orderfor there to be lasting peace, President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert have to cometogether and make tough choices. And I'm convinced they will. And I believe it's possible --not only possible, I believe it's going to happen, that there will be a signed peace treaty bythe time I leave office. That's what I believe. And the reason I believe that is because I hearthe urgency in the voice of both the Prime Minister of Israel and the President of thePalestinian Authority. Is it going to be hard work? You bet. And we can help support these negotiations, and will. Iwas asked yesterday at a press conference, you know, what do you intend to do; if you're notgoing to write the agreement, what do you intend to do? I said, nudge the process forward --like, pressure; be a pain if I need to be a pain -- which in some people's mind isn't all thathard. And they said, well, like -- yesterday, somebody said, well, are you disappointed?I arrived and it nudged the process forward. In other words, we can help influence theprocess, and will. But the only lasting peace will be achieved when the duly elected leaders ofthe respective peoples do the hard work. And so I want to help. And I want to help in the region, as well, Mr. President. The rest of mytrip will be talking about, obviously, security threats, but also the opportunity to achievepeace. And the Arab world has got an opportunity and obligation, in my judgment, to helpboth parties in these negotiations move the process forward. I explained yesterday, and I just want to explain again today, there are three tracks to thisprocess, as far as we're concerned. One is the negotiations to define a vision that will besubject to the road map. Secondly is to resolve -- help resolve road map issues. And today I introduced the Presidentto the General -- three-star Air Force General who will be running this process. We haveagreed to a trilateral process and want to help the Israelis and the Palestinians resolve theirdifferences over road map issues. And thirdly is to help the Palestinians develop the infrastructure necessary for a democracy --an economy -- and security forces that are capable of doing what the President and the PrimeMinister want to have done. And we're very much engaged. I'm looking forward to seeingTony Blair tomorrow, who is the Quartet's representative, and to find out what he has beendoing and what progress is being made. I am confident that with proper help, the state of Palestine will emerge. And I'm confident thatwhen it emerges it will be a major step towards peace. I am confident that the status quo isunacceptable, Mr. President, and we want to help you. And I appreciate your vision, and Iappreciate your courage, and I appreciate your hospitality. And I appreciate you giving me achance to talk to the press, of course.  A couple of questions, I understand.Question: Mr. President Abu Mazen, what are the results of this visit? Mr. President Bush,you said more than once that the Palestinian side must fulfill its obligations. And Mr. Fayyadhas had a security plan to help the peace. And when Mr. Fayyad went to Annapolis hecommended that security plan, and then Israel destroyed all those efforts in Annapolis. Howcan the Palestinian Authority do security efforts that are successful, and while Israel destroysand undermines all their efforts in the occupied territories? The other side of the question: Are you willing to give guarantees for the Palestinian side todeclaring a freezing on settlements immediately? Thank you. President Abbas: [As translated.] We are fully satisfied with the outcome that we reachedthrough this visit of Mr. President George Bush. We spoke about all topics that might occur toyour mind and that might not occur to your mind, as well. All the issues are in agreement. Weare agreed on all topics. All topics are clear. In the near future, in the coming few days, we are going to meet in bilateral negotiations withthe Israelis in order to discuss the final status negotiations, final status issues. And as Mr.President said, there are three themes -- the other theme is implementing the road mapthrough the committee, the trilateral committee. And the third point is the economic andsecurity conditions in Palestinian Territories. We have great hopes that during 2008 we willreach the final status and a peace treaty with Israel. President Bush: Each side has got obligations under the road map. Settlements are clearlystated in the road map obligations for Israel. We have made our concerns about expansion ofsettlements known, and we expect both parties to honor their obligations under the road map. Secondly, we're spending -- General Dayton is spending a lot of time trying to help thePresident and the Prime Minister develop security forces that are effective. There's noquestion in my mind the commitment to provide security for the average citizen is strong. Thequestion is the capabilities.And the truth of the matter is there needs to be a fair amount of work done to make sure thatthe security forces are modernized, well-trained and prepared, with a proper chain ofcommand to respond. And I will tell you I firmly believe the security forces are improving. I remember our visit in New York, and we discussed this during the U.N. General Assembly.And by any objective measurement, the Palestinian security forces in the West Bank areimproving. And so my message to the Israelis is that they ought to help, not hinder, the modernization ofthe Palestinian security force. It's in their interests that a government dedicated to peace andunderstanding the need for two states to live side by side in peace have a modern force. It's got -- very important for the government to be able to assure people that if there is aneed, there will be an effective force to provide security. That's just step one of havingcredibility with the people. And to the extent that Israeli actions have undermined theeffectiveness of the Palestinian force, or the authority of the state relative to the averagecitizen, is something that we don't agree with and have made our position clear. She just called on you. Question: -- [inaudible] -- President Bush: No, that's the road map obligation I was talking about. Question: -- [inaudible] -- President Bush: Yes. He's asking me about the checkpoints I drove through and myimpression about what it was like to drive through checkpoints. I can understand why thePalestinians are frustrated driving through checkpoints. I can also understand that untilconfidence is gained on both sides, why the Israelis would want there to be a sense ofsecurity.In other words, they don't want a state on their border from which attacks would be launched.I can understand that. Any reasonable person can understand that. Why would you work tohave a state on your border if you weren't confident they'd be a partner in peace? And so checkpoints create frustrations for people. They create a sense of security for Israel;they create massive frustrations for the Palestinians. You'll be happy to hear that mymotorcade of a mere 45 cars was able to make it through without being stopped.  But I'm notso exactly sure that's what happens to the average person. And so the whole object is tocreate a state that is capable of defending itself internally, and giving confidence to itsneighbor that checkpoints won't be needed. Now, the vision of the Palestinian state is one of contiguous territory. In other words, as I saidearlier in my administration, I said, Swiss cheese isn't going to work when it comes to theoutline of a state. And I mean that. There is no way that this good man can assure thePalestinians of a hopeful future if there's not contiguous territory. And we -- that position isabundantly clear to both sides. Therefore, the ultimate vision, of course, is there be nocheckpoints throughout the Palestinian state-to-be. And, you know, this is the issue. We're working through how to gain enough confidence onboth sides so that checkpoints won't be necessary, and a state can emerge. My judgment is, Ican understand frustrations. I mean, I hear it a lot. I heard it -- you know, the chiefnegotiator spent two hours at a checkpoint. All he was trying to do was go negotiate. And Ican see that -- I can see the frustrations. Look, I also understand that people in Israel -- andthe truth of the matter is, in the Palestinian Territories -- the average citizen wants to knowwhether or not there's going to be protection from the violent few who murder. The security of a state is essential, particularly in a day and age when people simply disregardthe value of human life, and kill. And so these checkpoints reflect the reality. And what we'retrying to do is alter the reality by laying out a vision that is much more hopeful than thestatus quo.Question: Mr. President George Bush -- you launched war against Iraq after the Iraqileadership refused to implement the United Nations resolutions. My question now is, what isthe problem to ask Israel just to accept and to respect the United Nations resolutions relatingto the Palestinian problem, which -- facilitating the achievement of ending the Israelioccupation to the Arab territories and facilitating also the solution between Palestinians andthe Israelis? And for Mahmoud Abbas, did you ask President George Bush to ask Israel to freezesettlements fully in order to enable negotiations from success? President Bush: Yes, but tell me the part about the U.N. thing again? What were you -- Icouldn't understand you very well. Question: I just asked why you ask Israel to accept the United Nations resolutions related tothe Palestinian problem, just to facilitate the solution, and to end the occupation. President Bush: Actually, I'm asking Israel to negotiate in good faith with an elected leaderof the Palestinian Territory to come up with a permanent solution that -- look, the U.N. dealdidn't work in the past. And so now we're going to have an opportunity to redefine the futureby having a state negotiated between an elected leader of the Palestinian people, as well asthe Prime Minister of Israel. This is an opportunity to move forward. And the only way for --the only way to defeat the terrorists in the long run is to offer an alternative vision that ismore hopeful. And that's what we're attempting to do, sir. We can stay stuck in the past, which will yield nothing good for the Palestinians, in myjudgment. We can chart a hopeful future, and that's exactly what this process is intending todo; to redefine the future for the Palestinian citizens and the Israelis. I'm confident that two democratic states living side by side in peace is in the interests not onlyof the Palestinians and the Israelis, but of the world. The question is whether or not the hardissues can be resolved and the vision emerges, so that the choice is clear amongst thePalestinians -- the choice being, do you want this state, or do you want the status quo?Do you want a future based upon a democratic state, or do you want the same old stuff? Andthat's a choice that I'm confident that if the Palestinian people are given, they will choosepeace. And so that's what we're trying to do, sir. President Abbas: [As translated.] The settlement for us is considered an obstacle fornegotiations, and we have spoke more than once with Mr. Prime Minister Olmert, very frankly.And we also spoke in this meeting with President George Bush, and consequently, thePresident understood this issue. And we have heard the statements given by the Secretary ofState, Dr. Rice, and she has -- her point of view regarding settlements was very positive. Question: President Bush, Prime Minister Olmert said that peace is not alive here as long asGaza militants continue their threats on Israel. How do you see, President, about --[inaudible] -- from Gaza? And for you, President Abbas, how do you intend, actually, to get control of Gaza, and do youthink this is possible by the end of the year and by the end of Mr. Bush's presidency? President Bush: First of all, Gaza is a tough situation. I don't know whether you can solve itin a year, or not. But I know this: It can't be solved unless the Prime Minister -- the Presidenthas a vision that he can lay out to the people of Gaza that says, here's your choice: Do youwant those who have created chaos to run your country, or do you want those of us whonegotiated a settlement with the Israelis that will lead to lasting peace? There is a competing vision taking place in Gaza. And in my judgment, Hamas, which I felt ranon a campaign of, we're going to improve your lives through better education and betterhealth, have delivered nothing but misery. And I'm convinced his government will yield ahopeful future. And the best way to make that abundantly clear is for there to be a visionthat's understandable.See, the past has just been empty words, you know. We -- actually it hasn't been that much -- I'm the only President that's really articulated a two-state solution so far -- but saying twostates really doesn't have much bearing until borders are defined, right of return issuesresolved, Jerusalem is understood, security measures -- the common security measures willbe in place. That's what I'm talking about. I'm talking about a clear, defined state aroundwhich people can rally. And there's going to be -- there will be no better difference, a clear difference, than the visionof Hamas in Gaza and the vision of the President and the Prime Minister and his team basedhere in Ramallah. And to me, that's how you solve the issue in the long-term. And thedefinition of long-term, I don't know what it means. I'm not a timetable person -- actually, Iam on a timetable -- got 12 months.  But I'm impressed by the President's understandingabout how a vision and a hopeful future will help clearly define the stakes amongst thePalestinian people. President Abbas: [As translated.] Gaza it is considered a coup by us, we consider it a coupd'etat what happened in Gaza. Now -- we consider it a coup d'etat.  And we deal with Gaza attwo levels. The first is that we deal with the people as part of us and we take full responsibilitythat is necessary towards our people. We spend in Gaza 58 percent of our budget. This is notto -- it is our duty towards our people that we provide them with all the need. As for the issue of Hamas, we said that this is a coup and they have to retreat from this coupand they have to recognize international legitimacy, all international legitimacy, and torecognize the Arab Initiative, as well. In this case we will have another talk. President Bush: Thank you, all. Thank you, all.",bush
"diplomatic corps, and distinguished guests: I am honored by the opportunity to stand on Arabsoil and speak to the people of this nation and this region. Throughout the sweep of history, the lands that the Arab people call home have played apivotal role in world affairs. These lands sit at the juncture of three great continents -- Europeand Asia and Africa. These lands have given birth to three of the world's major religions.These lands have seen the rise and fall of great civilizations. And in the 21st century, theselands are once again playing a central role in the human story. A great new era is unfolding before us. This new era is founded on the equality of all peoplebefore God. This new era is being built with the understanding that power is a trust that mustbe exercised with the consent of the governed -- and deliver equal justice under the law. Andthis new era offers hope for the millions across the Middle East who yearn for a future ofpeace and progress and opportunity.Here in Abu Dhabi, we see clearly the outlines of this future. Beginning with the revered fatherof this country -- Sheikh Zayed -- you have succeeded in building a prosperous society out ofthe desert. You have opened your doors to the world economy. You have encouraged womento contribute to the development of your nation -- and they have occupied some of yourhighest ministerial posts. You have held historic elections for the Federal National Council. Youhave shown the world a model of a Muslim state that is tolerant toward people of other faiths.I'm proud to stand in a nation where the people have an opportunity to build a better futurefor themselves and their families. Thank you for your warm hospitality. In my country, we speak of these developments as the advance of freedom. Others may call itthe advance of justice. Yet whatever term we use, the ideal is the same. In a free and justsociety, every person is treated with dignity. In a free and just society, leaders areaccountable to those they govern. And in a free and just society, individuals can rise as far astheir talents and hard work will take them. For decades, the people of this region saw their desire for liberty and justice denied at homeand dismissed abroad in the name of stability. Today your aspirations are threatened byviolent extremists who murder the innocent in pursuit of power. These extremists havehijacked the noble religion of Islam, and seek to impose their totalitarian ideology on millions.They hate freedom and they hate democracy -- because it fosters religious tolerance andallows people to chart their own future. They hate your government because it does not sharetheir dark vision. They hate the United States because they know we stand with you inopposition to their brutal ambitions. And everywhere they go, they use murder and fear tofoment instability to advance their aims. One cause of instability is the extremists supported and embodied by the regime that sits inTehran. Iran is today the world's leading state sponsor of terror. It sends hundreds of millionsof dollars to extremists around the world -- while its own people face repression and economichardship at home. It undermines Lebanese hopes for peace by arming and aiding the terroristgroup Hezbollah. It subverts the hopes for peace in other parts of the region by fundingterrorist groups like Hamas and the Palestine Islamic Jihad. It sends arms to the Taliban inAfghanistan and Shia militants in Iraq. It seeks to intimidate its neighbors with ballisticmissiles and bellicose rhetoric.And finally, it defies the United Nations and destabilizes the region by refusing to be open andtransparent about its nuclear programs and ambitions. Iran's actions threaten the security ofnations everywhere. So the United States is strengthening our longstanding securitycommitments with our friends in the Gulf -- and rallying friends around the world to confrontthis danger before it is too late. The other major cause of instability is the extremists embodied by al Qaeda and its affiliates.On September 11, 2001, al Qaeda murdered nearly 3,000 people on America's home soil.Some of the victims that day were innocent Muslims. And since then, al Qaeda and its allieshave killed many more Muslims here in the Middle East -- including women and children. InAfghanistan under the Taliban, on Iraq's Anbar Province, they ruled by intimidation andmurder. Their goal is to impose that same dark rule across the Middle East. So they seek totopple your governments, acquire weapons of mass destruction, and drive a wedge betweenthe people of the United States and the people of the Middle East. And they will fail. TheUnited States joins you in your commitment to the freedom and security of this region -- andwe will not abandon you to terrorists or extremists. The fight against the forces of extremism is the great ideological struggle of our time. And inthis fight, our nations have a weapon more powerful than bombs or bullets. It is the desire forfreedom and justice written into our hearts by Almighty God -- and no terrorist or tyrant cantake that away. We see this desire in the 12 million Iraqis who dipped their fingers in purpleink as they voted in defiance of al Qaeda. We see the desire in the Palestinians who elected aPresident committed to peace and reconciliation. We see this desire in the thousands ofLebanese whose protests helped rid their country of a foreign occupier. And we see this desirein the brave dissidents and journalists who speak out against terror and oppression andinjustice. We see this desire in the ordinary people across the Middle East, who are sick ofviolence, who are sick of corruption, sick of empty promises -- and who choose a free futurewhenever they are given a chance. We also see leaders across this region beginning to respond to the desires of their people --and take the steps that will help enhance the stability and prosperity of their nations. Therecent elections to your Federal National Council represent the first part of a larger reformdesigned to make your government more modern and more representative. Algeria held itsfirst competitive presidential elections. Kuwait held elections in which women were allowed tovote and hold office for the first time.Citizens have voted in municipal elections in Saudi Arabia, in competitive parliamentaryelections in Jordan and Morocco and Bahrain, and in a multiparty presidential election inYemen. Across the world, the majority of Muslim people live in a free and democratic society -- and the people of the Middle East must continue to work for the day where that is also trueof the lands that Islam first called home. As freedom and justice advance in this part of the world, elections are important, but they'reonly a start. Free and just societies require strong civic institutions, such as houses ofworship, universities, professional associations, local governments and community groups.Free and just societies require habits of self-government that contribute to the rule of law.And free and just societies ultimately depend on the emergence of an engaged public whosecitizens feel they have a real stake in their nation's future. All these developments contributeto the bond between government and the governed, between a people and their nation. Free and just societies also create opportunities for their citizens. This opportunity begins witheconomic growth. In any society, the greatest resource is not the oil in the ground or theminerals beneath the soil. It is the skills and talents of the people. Or as one Nobel winningeconomist calls this human capital. Across this region, you have an abundance of humancapital -- in the men and women who are your citizens. By strengthening your educationsystems and opening your economies, you will unlock their potential, create vibrant andentrepreneurial societies, and usher in a new era where people have confidence that tomorrowwill bring more opportunities than today. In the last few years, the nations of this region have made some great progress. The WorldBank reports that economic growth is strong and it is rising. Saudi Arabia has joined the WorldTrade Organization. Jordan, Oman, Bahrain, and Morocco have signed free trade agreementswith the United States. Your nations are attracting more foreign investment. Oil accounts formuch of the economic growth here. But the nations of the Middle East are now investing intheir people, and building infrastructure, and opening the door to foreign trade andinvestment. America supports you in these efforts. We believe that trade and investment isthe key to the future of hope and opportunity. We also believe that as we demand you openyour markets we should open ours, as well. We're encouraged by the movement towardeconomic freedom that we're seeing across the Middle East.Unfortunately, amid some steps forward in this region we've also seen some setbacks. Youcannot build trust when you hold an election where opposition candidates find themselvesharassed or in prison. You cannot expect people to believe in the promise of a better futurewhen they are jailed for peacefully petitioning their government. And you cannot stand up amodern and confident nation when you do not allow people to voice their legitimate criticisms. The United States appreciates that democratic progress requires tough choices. Our ownhistory teaches us that the road to freedom is not always even, and democracy does not comeovernight. Yet we also know that for all the difficulties, a society based on liberty is worth thesacrifice. We know that democracy is the only form of government that treats individuals withthe dignity and equality that is their right. We know from experience that democracy is theonly system of government that yields lasting peace and stability. In a democracy, leadersdepend on their people -- and most people do not want war and bloodshed and violence. Mostpeople want lives of peace and opportunity. So it is the declared policy of the United States tosupport these peoples as they claim their freedom -- as a matter of natural right and nationalinterest. I recognize that some people -- including some in my own country -- believe it is a mistake tosupport democratic freedom in the Middle East. They say that the Arab people are not ""ready""for democracy. Of course, that is exactly what people said about the Japanese after World WarII. Some said that having an Emperor was incompatible with democracy. Some said that theJapanese religion was incompatible with democracy. Some said that advancing freedom inJapan and the Pacific was unwise, because our interests lay in supporting pro-Americanleaders no matter how they ruled their people. Fortunately, America rejected this advice, kept our faith in freedom, and stood with the peopleof Asia. The results are now in. Today the people of Japan have both a working democracyand a hereditary emperor. They have preserved their traditional religious practices whiletolerating the faiths of others. They are surrounded by many democracies that reflect the fulldiversity of the region. Some of these democracies have constitutional monarchies, some haveparliaments, and some have presidents. Some of these democracies have Christian majorities,some have Muslim majorities, some have Hindu or Buddhist majorities. Yet for all thedifferences, the free nations of Asia all derive their authority from the consent of the governed-- and all know the lasting stability that only freedom can bring.This transformation would not have been possible without America's presence andperseverance over many decades. And just as our commitment to Asia helped people theresecure their freedom and prosperity, our commitment to the Middle East will help you achieveyours. And you can know from our record in Asia that our commitment is real, it is strong, andit is lasting. Today America is using its influence to foster peace and reconciliation in the Holy Land. TheIsraelis have raised a thriving modern society out of rocky soil, and want to live their lives infreedom and security at home and at peace with their neighbors. The Palestinian people aspireto build a nation of their own -- where they can live in dignity and realize their dreams. TodayIsraelis and Palestinians each understand that the only way to realize their own goals is byhelping one another. In other words, an independent, viable, democratic, and peacefulPalestinian state is more than the dream of the Palestinians. It's also the best guarantee forpeace for all its neighbors -- and the Israelis understand this. Leaders on both sides still havemany tough decisions ahead, and they will need to back these decisions with realcommitments. But the time has come for a Holy Land where Palestinian and Israeli livetogether in peace. America will do our part. In Annapolis in November, the United States invited the Israelis andthe Palestinians, and other members of the international community to come to a conference.And I appreciate the fact that your country sent a delegate. It was a remarkable thing to see aPalestinian President and an Israeli Prime Minister address a roomful of Arab leaders together.And the result was that the Palestinians and Israelis launched negotiations for theestablishment of a Palestinian state and a broader peace. The talks are just beginning, and our hopes are high. At the beginning of my trip, I met withboth Israeli and Palestinian leaders. I was impressed by their commitment to move forward.And by supporting the legitimate aspirations of both sides, we will encourage reconciliationbetween the Israeli and Palestinian people, foster reconciliation between Israelis and Arabs,and build a foundation for lasting peace that will contribute to the security of every state inthe Gulf.And as you build a Middle East growing in peace and prosperity, the United States will be yourpartner. As we have done in places from Asia to Europe, we have forged new relationshipswith friends and allies designed to help you protect your people and your borders. As we havedone in places from Asia to Europe, we're helping you bring your economies into the globalmarket. And as we have done in places from Asia to Europe, we have launched programsdesigned to help you promote economic reform and educational opportunity and politicalparticipation. The United States has no desire for territory. We seek our shared security in your liberty. Webelieve that stability can only come through a free and just Middle East -- where theextremists are marginalized by millions of moms and dads who want the same opportunitiesfor their children that we have for ours. So today I would like to speak directly to the people of the Middle East. To the Palestinian people: The dignity and sovereignty that is your right is within your reach.In President Abbas, you have a leader who understands that the path forward is throughpeaceful negotiations. Help him as he makes the tough decisions for peace. Oppose theextremists and terrorists who represent the greatest threat to a Palestinian state. The UnitedStates will help you build the institutions of democracy and prosperity -- and make yourdreams of a state come true. To the people of Israel: You know that peace and reconciliation with your neighbors is the bestpath to long-term security. We believe that peace is possible, though it requires toughdecisions. The United States will always stand with Israel in the face of terrorism. And we willsupport you as you work to ensure the security of your people -- and bring peace andreconciliation to the Holy Land. To the people of Iraq: You have made your choice for democracy, and you have stood firm inface of terrible acts of murder. The terrorists and extremists cannot prevail. They aretormented by the sight of an old man voting, or a young girl going to school -- because theyknow a successful democracy is a mortal threat to their ambitions. The United States isfighting side by side with Sunni and Shia and Kurd to root out the terrorists and extremists.We have dealt them serious blows. The United States will continue to support you as you buildthe institutions of a free society. And together we'll defeat our common enemies.To the people of Iran: You are rich in culture and talent. You have a right to live under agovernment that listens to your wishes, respects your talents, and allows you to build betterlives for your families. Unfortunately, your government denies you these opportunities, andthreatens the peace and stability of your neighbors. So we call on the regime in Tehran toheed your will, and to make itself accountable to you. The day will come when the people ofIran have a government that embraces liberty and justice, and Iran joins the community offree nations. And when that good day comes, you will have no better friend than the UnitedStates of America. To the leaders across the Middle East who are fighting the extremists: The United States willstand with you as you confront the terrorists and radicals. We urge you to join us incommitting the resources to help the Palestinians build the institutions of a free society. Helpthe citizens of Lebanon preserve their government and their sovereignty in the face of outsidepressure from their neighbors. Show the Iraqis that you support them in their effort to build amore hopeful nation. And as you do these things, the best way to defeat the extremists inyour midst is by opening your societies, and trusting in your people, and giving them a voicein their nation. And finally, to the people of the Middle East: We hear your cries for justice. We share yourdesire for a free and prosperous future. And as you struggle to find your voice and make yourway in this world, the United States will stand with you. For most of the world, there's no greater symbol of America than the Statue of Liberty. It wasdesigned by a man who traveled widely in this part of the world -- and who had originallyenvisioned his woman bearing a torch as standing over the Suez Canal. Ultimately, of course,it was erected in New York Harbor, where it has been an inspiration to generations ofimmigrants. One of these immigrants was a poet-writer named Ameen Rihani. Gazing at herlamp held high, he wondered whether her sister might be erected in the lands of his Arabforefathers. Here is how he put it: ""When will you turn your face toward the East, oh Liberty?"" My friends, a future of liberty stands before you. It is your right. It is your dream. And it is your destiny.",bush
"Over the past several months I've held a series of meetings with my economic team on theoutlook for the U.S. economy. And before I left for the Middle East, I directed them to conducta thorough assessment of our economic condition, consult with members of Congress, andprovide me with their recommendations about any actions we might need to take. The economic team reports that our economy has a solid foundation, but that there are areasof real concern. Our economy is still creating jobs, though at a reduced pace. Consumerspending is still growing, but the housing market is declining. Business investment andexports are still rising, but the cost of imported oil has increased.My administration has been watching our economy carefully. My advisors and many outsideexperts expect that our economy will continue to grow over the coming year, but at a slowerrate than we have enjoyed for the past few years. And there is a risk of a downturn.Continued instability in the housing and financial markets could cause additional harm to ouroverall economy, and put our growth and job creation in jeopardy. In recent months, we've taken steps to shore up the housing market, including measures tohelp struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure and to keep their homes. I've also askedCongress to pass legislation to modernize the Federal Housing Administration and enable it toprovide additional assistance to struggling homeowners. The House passed a bill and theSenate passed a bill, and now they need to get together and get a bill to my desk as quicklyas possible. After careful consideration, and after discussions with members of Congress, I have concludedthat additional action is needed. To keep our economy growing and creating jobs, Congressand the administration need to work to enact an economic growth package as soon aspossible. As Congress considers such a plan, there are certain principles that must guide itsdeliberations: This growth package must be big enough to make a difference in an economyas large and dynamic as ours -- which means it should be about 1 percent of GDP. Thisgrowth package must be built on broad-based tax relief that will directly affect economicgrowth -- and not the kind of spending projects that would have little immediate impact onour economy. This growth package must be temporary and take effect right away -- so we canget help to our economy when it needs it most. And this growth package must not include anytax increases. Specifically, this growth package should bolster both business investment and consumerspending, which are critical to economic growth. And this would require two key provisions: Tobe effective, a growth package must include tax incentives for American businesses, includingsmall businesses, to make major investments in their enterprises this year.Giving them an incentive to invest now will encourage business owners to expand theiroperations, create new jobs, and inject new energy into our economy in the process. To be effective, a growth package must also include direct and rapid income tax relief for theAmerican people. Americans could use this money as they see fit -- to help meet theirmonthly bills, cover higher costs at the gas pump, or pay for other basic necessities. LettingAmericans keep more of their own money should increase consumer spending, and lift oureconomy at a time when people otherwise might spend less. Yesterday, I spoke to members of the congressional leadership from both political parties.They shared with me their thoughts on the best way forward. And I was encouraged by thosediscussions and I believe there is enough broad consensus that we can come up with apackage that can be approved with bipartisan support. I've asked Treasury Secretary HankPaulson to lead my administration's efforts to forge an agreement with Congress, so that wecan deliver this needed boost to our economy as quickly as possible. Passing a new growth package is our most pressing economic priority. When that is done,Congress must turn to the most important economic priority for our country, and that'smaking sure the tax relief that is now in place is not taken away. A source of uncertainty inour economy is that this tax relief is set to expire at the end of 2010. Unless Congress acts,the American people will face massive tax increases in less than three years. The marriagepenalty will make a comeback; the child tax credit will be cut in half; the death tax will comeback to life; and tax rates will go up on regular income, capital gains, and dividends. This taxincrease would put jobs and economic growth at risk, and Congress has a responsibility tokeep that from happening. So it's critical that Congress make this tax relief permanent. We're in the midst of a challenging period, and I know Americans are concerned about oureconomic future. But our economy has seen challenging times before -- and it is resilient.In a vibrant economy, markets rise and decline. We cannot change that fundamental dynamic.As a matter of fact, eliminating risk altogether would also eliminate the innovation andproductivity that drives the creation of jobs and wealth in America. Yet there are also timeswhen swift and temporary actions can help ensure that inevitable market adjustments do notundermine the health of the broader economy. This is such a moment. By passing an effective growth package quickly, we can provide a shot in the arm to keep afundamentally strong economy healthy. And it will help keep economic sectors that are goingthrough adjustments, such as the housing market, from adversely affecting other parts of oureconomy. I'm optimistic about our economic future, because Americans have shown time and again thatthey are the most industrious, creative, and enterprising people in the world. That is what hasmade our economy strong. That is what will make it stronger in the challenging times ahead. Thank you.",bush
"Madam Speaker, Vice President Cheney, members of Congress, distinguished guests, andfellow citizens: Seven years have passed since I first stood before you at this rostrum. In thattime, our country has been tested in ways none of us could have imagined. We faced harddecisions about peace and war, rising competition in the world economy, and the health andwelfare of our citizens. These issues call for vigorous debate, and I think it's fair to say we'veanswered the call. Yet history will record that amid our differences, we acted with purpose.And together, we showed the world the power and resilience of American self-government.All of us were sent to Washington to carry out the people's business. That is the purpose ofthis body. It is the meaning of our oath. It remains our charge to keep. The actions of the 110th Congress will affect the security and prosperity of our nation longafter this session has ended. In this election year, let us show our fellow Americans that werecognize our responsibilities and are determined to meet them. Let us show them thatRepublicans and Democrats can compete for votes and cooperate for results at the same time.From expanding opportunity to protecting our country, we've made good progress. Yet wehave unfinished business before us, and the American people expect us to get it done. In the work ahead, we must be guided by the philosophy that made our nation great. AsAmericans, we believe in the power of individuals to determine their destiny and shape thecourse of history. We believe that the most reliable guide for our country is the collectivewisdom of ordinary citizens. And so in all we do, we must trust in the ability of free peoples tomake wise decisions, and empower them to improve their lives for their futures. To build a prosperous future, we must trust people with their own money and empower themto grow our economy. As we meet tonight, our economy is undergoing a period of uncertainty.America has added jobs for a record 52 straight months, but jobs are now growing at a slowerpace. Wages are up, but so are prices for food and gas. Exports are rising, but the housingmarket has declined. At kitchen tables across our country, there is a concern about oureconomic future. In the long run, Americans can be confident about our economic growth. But in the short run,we can all see that that growth is slowing. So last week, my administration reachedagreement with Speaker Pelosi and Republican Leader Boehner on a robust growth packagethat includes tax relief for individuals and families and incentives for business investment. Thetemptation will be to load up the bill. That would delay it or derail it, and neither option isacceptable. This is a good agreement that will keep our economy growing and our peopleworking. And this Congress must pass it as soon as possible.We have other work to do on taxes. Unless Congress acts, most of the tax relief we'vedelivered over the past seven years will be taken away. Some in Washington argue thatletting tax relief expire is not a tax increase. Try explaining that to 116 million Americantaxpayers who would see their taxes rise by an average of $1,800. Others have said theywould personally be happy to pay higher taxes. I welcome their enthusiasm. I'm pleased toreport that the IRS accepts both checks and money orders.Most Americans think their taxes are high enough. With all the other pressures on theirfinances, American families should not have to worry about their federal government taking abigger bite out of their paychecks. There's only one way to eliminate this uncertainty: Makethe tax relief permanent. And members of Congress should know: If any bill raises taxesreaches my desk, I will veto it.Just as we trust Americans with their own money, we need to earn their trust by spendingtheir tax dollars wisely. Next week, I'll send you a budget that terminates or substantiallyreduces 151 wasteful or bloated programs, totaling more than $18 billion. The budget that Iwill submit will keep America on track for a surplus in 2012. American families have to balancetheir budgets; so should their government.The people's trust in their government is undermined by congressional earmarks -- specialinterest projects that are often snuck in at the last minute, without discussion or debate. Lastyear, I asked you to voluntarily cut the number and cost of earmarks in half. I also asked youto stop slipping earmarks into committee reports that never even come to a vote.Unfortunately, neither goal was met. So this time, if you send me an appropriations bill thatdoes not cut the number and cost of earmarks in half, I'll send it back to you with my veto. And tomorrow, I will issue an executive order that directs federal agencies to ignore anyfuture earmark that is not voted on by Congress. If these items are truly worth funding,Congress should debate them in the open and hold a public vote.Our shared responsibilities extend beyond matters of taxes and spending. On housing, wemust trust Americans with the responsibility of homeownership and empower them to weatherturbulent times in the housing market. My administration brought together the HOPE NOWalliance, which is helping many struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure. And Congress canhelp even more.Tonight I ask you to pass legislation to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, modernize theFederal Housing Administration, and allow state housing agencies to issue tax-free bonds tohelp homeowners refinance their mortgages. These are difficult times for many Americanfamilies, and by taking these steps, we can help more of them keep their homes. To build a future of quality health care, we must trust patients and doctors to make medicaldecisions and empower them with better information and better options. We share a commongoal: making health care more affordable and accessible for all Americans. The best way toachieve that goal is by expanding consumer choice, not government control. So I haveproposed ending the bias in the tax code against those who do not get their health insurancethrough their employer. This one reform would put private coverage within reach for millions,and I call on the Congress to pass it this year.The Congress must also expand health savings accounts, create Association Health Plans forsmall businesses, promote health information technology, and confront the epidemic of junkmedical lawsuits. With all these steps, we will help ensure that decisions about your medicalcare are made in the privacy of your doctor's office -- not in the halls of Congress.On education, we must trust students to learn if given the chance, and empower parents todemand results from our schools. In neighborhoods across our country, there are boys andgirls with dreams -- and a decent education is their only hope of achieving them. Six years ago, we came together to pass the No Child Left Behind Act, and today no one candeny its results. Last year, fourth and eighth graders achieved the highest math scores onrecord. Reading scores are on the rise. African American and Hispanic students posted all-timehighs. Now we must work together to increase accountability, add flexibility for states anddistricts, reduce the number of high school dropouts, provide extra help for struggling schools. Members of Congress: The No Child Left Behind Act is a bipartisan achievement. It issucceeding. And we owe it to America's children, their parents, and their teachers tostrengthen this good law.We must also do more to help children when their schools do not measure up. Thanks to theD.C. Opportunity Scholarships you approved, more than 2,600 of the poorest children in ourNation's Capital have found new hope at a faith-based or other non-public school. Sadly, theseschools are disappearing at an alarming rate in many of America's inner cities. So I willconvene a White House summit aimed at strengthening these lifelines of learning. And to openthe doors of these schools to more children, I ask you to support a new $300 million programcalled Pell Grants for Kids. We have seen how Pell Grants help low-income college studentsrealize their full potential. Together, we've expanded the size and reach of these grants. Nowlet us apply that same spirit to help liberate poor children trapped in failing public schools.On trade, we must trust American workers to compete with anyone in the world and empowerthem by opening up new markets overseas. Today, our economic growth increasingly dependson our ability to sell American goods and crops and services all over the world. So we'reworking to break down barriers to trade and investment wherever we can. We're working for asuccessful Doha Round of trade talks, and we must complete a good agreement this year. Atthe same time, we're pursuing opportunities to open up new markets by passing free tradeagreements. I thank the Congress for approving a good agreement with Peru. And now I ask you toapprove agreements with Colombia and Panama and South Korea. Many products from thesenations now enter America duty-free, yet many of our products face steep tariffs in theirmarkets. These agreements will level the playing field. They will give us better access tonearly 100 million customers. They will support good jobs for the finest workers in the world:those whose products say ""Made in the USA.""These agreements also promote America's strategic interests. The first agreement that willcome before you is with Colombia, a friend of America that is confronting violence and terror,and fighting drug traffickers. If we fail to pass this agreement, we will embolden the purveyorsof false populism in our hemisphere. So we must come together, pass this agreement, andshow our neighbors in the region that democracy leads to a better life.Trade brings better jobs and better choices and better prices. Yet for some Americans, tradecan mean losing a job, and the federal government has a responsibility to help. I askCongress to reauthorize and reform trade adjustment assistance, so we can help thesedisplaced workers learn new skills and find new jobs.To build a future of energy security, we must trust in the creative genius of Americanresearchers and entrepreneurs and empower them to pioneer a new generation of cleanenergy technology. Our security, our prosperity, and our environment all require reducing ourdependence on oil. Last year, I asked you to pass legislation to reduce oil consumption overthe next decade, and you responded. Together we should take the next steps: Let us fundnew technologies that can generate coal power while capturing carbon emissions. Let usincrease the use of renewable power and emissions-free nuclear power. Let us continueinvesting in advanced battery technology and renewable fuels to power the cars and trucks ofthe future. Let us create a new international clean technology fund, which will help developingnations like India and China make greater use of clean energy sources. And let us complete aninternational agreement that has the potential to slow, stop, and eventually reverse thegrowth of greenhouse gases. This agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy andgives none a free ride. The United States is committed to strengthening our energy securityand confronting global climate change. And the best way to meet these goals is for America tocontinue leading the way toward the development of cleaner and more energy-efficienttechnology.To keep America competitive into the future, we must trust in the skill of our scientists andengineers and empower them to pursue the breakthroughs of tomorrow. Last year, Congresspassed legislation supporting the American Competitiveness Initiative, but never followedthrough with the funding. This funding is essential to keeping our scientific edge. So I askCongress to double federal support for critical basic research in the physical sciences andensure America remains the most dynamic nation on Earth.On matters of life and science, we must trust in the innovative spirit of medical researchersand empower them to discover new treatments while respecting moral boundaries. InNovember, we witnessed a landmark achievement when scientists discovered a way toreprogram adult skin cells to act like embryonic stem cells. This breakthrough has thepotential to move us beyond the divisive debates of the past by extending the frontiers ofmedicine without the destruction of human life.So we're expanding funding for this type of ethical medical research. And as we explorepromising avenues of research, we must also ensure that all life is treated with the dignity itdeserves. And so I call on Congress to pass legislation that bans unethical practices such asthe buying, selling, patenting, or cloning of human life.On matters of justice, we must trust in the wisdom of our founders and empower judges whounderstand that the Constitution means what it says. I've submitted judicial nominees whowill rule by the letter of the law, not the whim of the gavel. Many of these nominees are beingunfairly delayed. They are worthy of confirmation, and the Senate should give each of them aprompt up-or-down vote.In communities across our land, we must trust in the good heart of the American people andempower them to serve their neighbors in need. Over the past seven years, more of ourfellow citizens have discovered that the pursuit of happiness leads to the path of service.Americans have volunteered in record numbers. Charitable donations are higher than ever.Faith-based groups are bringing hope to pockets of despair, with newfound support from thefederal government. And to help guarantee equal treatment of faith-based organizations whenthey compete for federal funds, I ask you to permanently extend Charitable Choice.Tonight the armies of compassion continue the march to a new day in the Gulf Coast. Americahonors the strength and resilience of the people of this region. We reaffirm our pledge to helpthem build stronger and better than before. And tonight I'm pleased to announce that in Aprilwe will host this year's North American Summit of Canada, Mexico, and the United States inthe great city of New Orleans.There are two other pressing challenges that I've raised repeatedly before this body, and thatthis body has failed to address: entitlement spending and immigration. Every member in thischamber knows that spending on entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, andMedicaid is growing faster than we can afford. We all know the painful choices ahead ifAmerica stays on this path: massive tax increases, sudden and drastic cuts in benefits, orcrippling deficits. I've laid out proposals to reform these programs. Now I ask members ofCongress to offer your proposals and come up with a bipartisan solution to save these vitalprograms for our children and our grandchildren.The other pressing challenge is immigration. America needs to secure our borders -- and withyour help, my administration is taking steps to do so. We're increasing worksite enforcement,deploying fences and advanced technologies to stop illegal crossings. We've effectively endedthe policy of ""catch and release"" at the border, and by the end of this year, we will havedoubled the number of border patrol agents. Yet we also need to acknowledge that we willnever fully secure our border until we create a lawful way for foreign workers to come hereand support our economy. This will take pressure off the border and allow law enforcement toconcentrate on those who mean us harm. We must also find a sensible and humane way todeal with people here illegally. Illegal immigration is complicated, but it can be resolved. Andit must be resolved in a way that upholds both our laws and our highest ideals.This is the business of our nation here at home. Yet building a prosperous future for ourcitizens also depends on confronting enemies abroad and advancing liberty in troubled regionsof the world. Our foreign policy is based on a clear premise: We trust that people, when given the chance,will choose a future of freedom and peace. In the last seven years, we have witnessed stirringmoments in the history of liberty. We've seen citizens in Georgia and Ukraine stand up fortheir right to free and fair elections. We've seen people in Lebanon take to the streets todemand their independence. We've seen Afghans emerge from the tyranny of the Taliban andchoose a new president and a new parliament. We've seen jubilant Iraqis holding up ink-stained fingers and celebrating their freedom. These images of liberty have inspired us.In the past seven years, we've also seen images that have sobered us. We've watchedthrongs of mourners in Lebanon and Pakistan carrying the caskets of beloved leaders taken bythe assassin's hand. We've seen wedding guests in blood-soaked finery staggering from ahotel in Jordan, Afghans and Iraqis blown up in mosques and markets, and trains in Londonand Madrid ripped apart by bombs. On a clear September day, we saw thousands of our fellowcitizens taken from us in an instant. These horrific images serve as a grim reminder: Theadvance of liberty is opposed by terrorists and extremists -- evil men who despise freedom,despise America, and aim to subject millions to their violent rule. Since 9/11, we have taken the fight to these terrorists and extremists. We will stay on theoffense, we will keep up the pressure, and we will deliver justice to our enemies.We are engaged in the defining ideological struggle of the 21st century. The terrorists opposeevery principle of humanity and decency that we hold dear. Yet in this war on terror, there isone thing we and our enemies agree on: In the long run, men and women who are free todetermine their own destinies will reject terror and refuse to live in tyranny. And that is whythe terrorists are fighting to deny this choice to the people in Lebanon, Iraq, Afghanistan,Pakistan, and the Palestinian Territories. And that is why, for the security of America and thepeace of the world, we are spreading the hope of freedom.In Afghanistan, America, our 25 NATO allies, and 15 partner nations are helping the Afghanpeople defend their freedom and rebuild their country. Thanks to the courage of these militaryand civilian personnel, a nation that was once a safe haven for al Qaeda is now a youngdemocracy where boys and girls are going to school, new roads and hospitals are being built,and people are looking to the future with new hope. These successes must continue, so we'readding 3,200 Marines to our forces in Afghanistan, where they will fight the terrorists andtrain the Afghan Army and police. Defeating the Taliban and al Qaeda is critical to oursecurity, and I thank the Congress for supporting America's vital mission in Afghanistan.In Iraq, the terrorists and extremists are fighting to deny a proud people their liberty, andfighting to establish safe havens for attacks across the world. One year ago, our enemies weresucceeding in their efforts to plunge Iraq into chaos. So we reviewed our strategy andchanged course. We launched a surge of American forces into Iraq. We gave our troops a newmission: Work with the Iraqi forces to protect the Iraqi people, pursue the enemy in itsstrongholds, and deny the terrorists sanctuary anywhere in the country. The Iraqi people quickly realized that something dramatic had happened. Those who hadworried that America was preparing to abandon them instead saw tens of thousands ofAmerican forces flowing into their country. They saw our forces moving into neighborhoods,clearing out the terrorists, and staying behind to ensure the enemy did not return. And theysaw our troops, along with Provincial Reconstruction Teams that include Foreign Serviceofficers and other skilled public servants, coming in to ensure that improved security wasfollowed by improvements in daily life. Our military and civilians in Iraq are performing withcourage and distinction, and they have the gratitude of our whole nation.The Iraqis launched a surge of their own. In the fall of 2006, Sunni tribal leaders grew tired ofal Qaeda's brutality and started a popular uprising called ""The Anbar Awakening."" Over thepast year, similar movements have spread across the country. And today, the grassrootssurge includes more than 80,000 Iraqi citizens who are fighting the terrorists. Thegovernment in Baghdad has stepped forward, as well -- adding more than 100,000 new Iraqisoldiers and police during the past year. While the enemy is still dangerous and more work remains, the American and Iraqi surgeshave achieved results few of us could have imagined just one year ago. When we met lastyear, many said that containing the violence was impossible. A year later, high profile terroristattacks are down, civilian deaths are down, sectarian killings are down. When we met last year, militia extremists -- some armed and trained by Iran -- werewreaking havoc in large areas of Iraq. A year later, coalition and Iraqi forces have killed orcaptured hundreds of militia fighters. And Iraqis of all backgrounds increasingly realize thatdefeating these militia fighters is critical to the future of their country. When we met last year, al Qaeda had sanctuaries in many areas of Iraq, and their leaders hadjust offered American forces safe passage out of the country. Today, it is al Qaeda that issearching for safe passage. They have been driven from many of the strongholds they onceheld, and over the past year, we've captured or killed thousands of extremists in Iraq,including hundreds of key al Qaeda leaders and operatives. Last month, Osama bin Laden released a tape in which he railed against Iraqi tribal leaderswho have turned on al Qaeda and admitted that coalition forces are growing stronger in Iraq.Ladies and gentlemen, some may deny the surge is working, but among the terrorists there isno doubt. Al Qaeda is on the run in Iraq, and this enemy will be defeated.When we met last year, our troop levels in Iraq were on the rise. Today, because of theprogress just described, we are implementing a policy of ""return on success,"" and the surgeforces we sent to Iraq are beginning to come home.This progress is a credit to the valor of our troops and the brilliance of their commanders. Thisevening, I want to speak directly to our men and women on the front lines. Soldiers andsailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen: In the past year, you have done everythingwe've asked of you, and more. Our nation is grateful for your courage. We are proud of youraccomplishments. And tonight in this hallowed chamber, with the American people as ourwitness, we make you a solemn pledge: In the fight ahead, you will have all you need toprotect our nation. And I ask Congress to meet its responsibilities to these brave men andwomen by fully funding our troops.Our enemies in Iraq have been hit hard. They are not yet defeated, and we can still expecttough fighting ahead. Our objective in the coming year is to sustain and build on the gains wemade in 2007, while transitioning to the next phase of our strategy. American troops areshifting from leading operations, to partnering with Iraqi forces, and, eventually, to aprotective over watch mission. As part of this transition, one Army brigade combat team andone Marine Expeditionary Unit have already come home and will not be replaced. In thecoming months, four additional brigades and two Marine battalions will follow suit. Takentogether, this means more than 20,000 of our troops are coming home.Any further drawdown of U.S. troops will be based on conditions in Iraq and therecommendations of our commanders. General Petraeus has warned that too fast a drawdowncould result in the ""disintegration of the Iraqi security forces, al Qaeda-Iraq regaining lostground, [and] a marked increase in violence."" Members of Congress: Having come so far andachieved so much, we must not allow this to happen.In the coming year, we will work with Iraqi leaders as they build on the progress they'remaking toward political reconciliation. At the local level, Sunnis, Shia, and Kurds are beginningto come together to reclaim their communities and rebuild their lives. Progress in theprovinces must be matched by progress in Baghdad. We're seeing some encouraging signs.The national government is sharing oil revenues with the provinces. The parliament recentlypassed both a pension law and de-Baathification reform. They're now debating a provincialpowers law. The Iraqis still have a distance to travel. But after decades of dictatorship and thepain of sectarian violence, reconciliation is taking place -- and the Iraqi people are takingcontrol of their future.The mission in Iraq has been difficult and trying for our nation. But it is in the vital interest ofthe United States that we succeed. A free Iraq will deny al Qaeda a safe haven. A free Iraqwill show millions across the Middle East that a future of liberty is possible. A free Iraq will bea friend of America, a partner in fighting terror, and a source of stability in a dangerous partof the world. By contrast, a failed Iraq would embolden the extremists, strengthen Iran, and give terroristsa base from which to launch new attacks on our friends, our allies, and our homeland. Theenemy has made its intentions clear. At a time when the momentum seemed to favor them, alQaida's top commander in Iraq declared that they will not rest until they have attacked ushere in Washington. My fellow Americans: We will not rest either. We will not rest until thisenemy has been defeated. We must do the difficult work today, so that years from now peoplewill look back and say that this generation rose to the moment, prevailed in a tough fight, andleft behind a more hopeful region and a safer America. We're also standing against the forces of extremism in the Holy Land, where we have newcause for hope. Palestinians have elected a president who recognizes that confronting terror isessential to achieving a state where his people can live in dignity and at peace with Israel.Israelis have leaders who recognize that a peaceful, democratic Palestinian state will be asource of lasting security. This month in Ramallah and Jerusalem, I assured leaders from bothsides that America will do, and I will do, everything we can to help them achieve a peaceagreement that defines a Palestinian state by the end of this year. The time has come for aHoly Land where a democratic Israel and a democratic Palestine live side-by-side in peace. We're also standing against the forces of extremism embodied by the regime in Tehran. Iran'srulers oppress a good and talented people. And wherever freedom advances in the MiddleEast, it seems the Iranian regime is there to oppose it. Iran is funding and training militiagroups in Iraq, supporting Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanon, and backing Hamas' efforts toundermine peace in the Holy Land. Tehran is also developing ballistic missiles of increasingrange, and continues to develop its capability to enrich uranium, which could be used tocreate a nuclear weapon.Our message to the people of Iran is clear: We have no quarrel with you.We respect your traditions and your history. We look forward to the day when you have yourfreedom. Our message to the leaders of Iran is also clear: Verifiably suspend your nuclearenrichment, so negotiations can begin. And to rejoin the community of nations, come cleanabout your nuclear intentions and past actions, stop your oppression at home, cease yoursupport for terror abroad. But above all, know this: America will confront those who threatenour troops. We will stand by our allies, and we will defend our vital interests in the PersianGulf.On the home front, we will continue to take every lawful and effective measure to protect ourcountry. This is our most solemn duty. We are grateful that there has not been another attackon our soil since 9/11. This is not for the lack of desire or effort on the part of the enemy. Inthe past six years, we've stopped numerous attacks, including a plot to fly a plane into thetallest building in Los Angeles and another to blow up passenger jets bound for America overthe Atlantic. Dedicated men and women in our government toil day and night to stop theterrorists from carrying out their plans. These good citizens are saving American lives, andeveryone in this chamber owes them our thanks. And we owe them something more: We owe them the tools they need to keep our peoplesafe. And one of the most important tools we can give them is the ability to monitor terroristcommunications. To protect America, we need to know who the terrorists are talking to, whatthey are saying, and what they're planning. Last year, Congress passed legislation to help usdo that. Unfortunately, Congress set the legislation to expire on February the 1st. That meansif you don't act by Friday, our ability to track terrorist threats would be weakened and ourcitizens will be in greater danger. Congress must ensure the flow of vital intelligence is notdisrupted. Congress must pass liability protection for companies believed to have assisted inthe efforts to defend America. We've had ample time for debate. The time to act is now.Protecting our nation from the dangers of a new century requires more than good intelligenceand a strong military. It also requires changing the conditions that breed resentment andallow extremists to prey on despair. So America is using its influence to build a freer, morehopeful, and more compassionate world. This is a reflection of our national interest; it is thecalling of our conscience. America opposes genocide in Sudan. We support freedom in countries from Cuba andZimbabwe to Belarus and Burma.America is leading the fight against global poverty, with strong education initiatives andhumanitarian assistance. We've also changed the way we deliver aid by launching theMillennium Challenge Account. This program strengthens democracy, transparency, and therule of law in developing nations, and I ask you to fully fund this important initiative.America is leading the fight against global hunger. Today, more than half the world's food aidcomes from the United States. And tonight, I ask Congress to support an innovative proposalto provide food assistance by purchasing crops directly from farmers in the developing world,so we can build up local agriculture and help break the cycle of famine. America is leading the fight against disease. With your help, we're working to cut by half thenumber of malaria-related deaths in 15 African nations. And our Emergency Plan for AIDSRelief is treating 1.4 million people. We can bring healing and hope to many more. So I askyou to maintain the principles that have changed behavior and made this program a success.And I call on you to double our initial commitment to fighting HIV/AIDS by approving anadditional $30 billion over the next five years. America is a force for hope in the world because we are a compassionate people, and some ofthe most compassionate Americans are those who have stepped forward to protect us. Wemust keep faith with all who have risked life and limb so that we might live in freedom andpeace. Over the past seven years, we've increased funding for veterans by more than 95percent. And as we increase funding -- And as increase funding we must also reform ourveterans system to meet the needs of a new war and a new generation. I call on the Congressto enact the reforms recommended by Senator Bob Dole and Secretary Donna Shalala, so wecan improve the system of care for our wounded warriors and help them build lives of hopeand promise and dignity. Our military families also sacrifice for America. They endure sleepless nights and the dailystruggle of providing for children while a loved one is serving far from home. We have aresponsibility to provide for them. So I ask you to join me in expanding their access to childcare, creating new hiring preferences for military spouses across the federal government, andallowing our troops to transfer their unused education benefits to their spouses or children.Our military families serve our nation, they inspire our nation, and tonight our nation honorsthem.The strength -- the secret of our strength, the miracle of America, is that our greatness liesnot in our government, but in the spirit and determination of our people. When the FederalConvention met in Philadelphia in 1787, our nation was bound by the Articles ofConfederation, which began with the words, ""We the undersigned delegates."" When GovernorMorris was asked to draft a preamble to our new Constitution, he offered an importantrevision and opened with words that changed the course of our nation and the history of theworld: ""We the people."" By trusting the people, our Founders wagered that a great and noble nation could be built onthe liberty that resides in the hearts of all men and women. By trusting the people,succeeding generations transformed our fragile young democracy into the most powerfulnation on Earth and a beacon of hope for millions. And so long as we continue to trust thepeople, our nation will prosper, our liberty will be secure, and the state of our Union willremain strong. So tonight, with confidence in freedom's power, and trust in the people, let us set forth to dotheir business. God bless America.",bush
"The issue of research involving stem cells derived from human embryos is increasingly thesubject of a national debate and dinner table discussions. The issue is confronted every day inlaboratories as scientists ponder the ethical ramifications of their work. It is agonized over byparents and many couples as they try to have children or to save children already born. Theissue is debated within the church, with people of different faiths, even many of the samefaith, coming to different conclusions.Many people are finding that the more they know about stem cell research, the less certainthey are about the right ethical and moral conclusions.My administration must decide whether to allow federal funds, your tax dollars, to be used forscientific research on stem cells derived from human embryos.A large number of these embryos already exist. They are the product of a process called invitro fertilization which helps so many couples conceive children.When doctors match sperm and egg to create life outside the womb, they usually producemore embryos than are implanted in the mother. Once a couple successfully has children or ifthey are unsuccessful, the additional embryos remain frozen in laboratories. Some will notsurvive during long storage, others are destroyed. A number have been donated to scienceand used to create privately funded stem cell lines. And a few have  been implanted in anadoptive mother and born and are today healthy children.Based on preliminary work that has been privately funded, scientists believe further researchusing stem cells offers great promise that could help improve the lives of those who sufferfrom many terrible diseases, from juvenile diabetesto Alzheimer, from Parkinsons to spinalcord injuries. And while scientists admit they are not yet certain, they believe stem cellsderived from embryos have unique potential.You should also know that stem cells can be derived from sources other than embryos: fromadult cells, from umbilical cords that are discarded after babies are born, from humanplacentas. And many scientists feel research on these types of stem cells is also promising.Many patients suffering from a range of diseases are already being helped with treatmentsdeveloped from adult stem cells.However, most scientists, at least today, believe that research on embryonic stem cells offersthe most promise because these cells have the potential to develop in all of the tissues in thebody.Scientists further believe that rapid progress in this research will come only with federal funds.Federal dollars help attract the best and brightest scientists. They ensure new discoveries arewidely shared at the largest number of research facilities, and that the research is directedtoward the greatest  public good.The United States has a long and proud record of leading the world toward advances inscience and medicine that improve human life, and the United States has a long and proudrecord of upholding the highest standards of ethics as we expand the limits of science andknowledge.Research on embryonic stem cells raises profound ethical questions, because extracting thestem cell destroys the embryo, and thus destroys its potential for life.Like a snowflake, each of these embryos is unique, with the unique genetic potential of anindividual human being.As I thought through this issue I kept returning to two fundamental questions. First, are thesefrozen embryos human life and therefore something precious to be protected? And second, ifthey're going to be destroyed anyway, shouldn't they be used for a greater good, for researchthat has the potential to save and improve other lives?I've asked those questions and others of scientists, scholars, bio-ethicists, religious leaders,doctors, researchers, members of Congress, my Cabinet and my friends. I have read heartfeltletters from many Americans. I have given this issue a great deal of thought, prayer, andconsiderable reflection, and I have found widespread disagreement.On the first issue, are these embryos human life? Well, one researcher told me he believesthis five-day-old cluster of cells is not an embryo, not yet an individual but a pre-embryo. Heargued that it has the potential for life, but it is not a life because it cannot develop on itsown.An ethicist dismissed that as a callous attempt at rationalization. ""Make no mistake,"" he toldme, ""that cluster of cells is the same way you and I, and all the rest of us, started our lives.One goes with a heavy heart if we use these,"" he said, ""because we are dealing with the seedsof the next generation.""And to the other crucial question -- If these are going to be destroyed anyway, why not usethem for good purpose? -- I also found different answers.Many are these embryos are byproducts of a process that helps create life and we shouldallow couples to donate them to science so they can be used for good purpose instead ofwasting their potential.Others will argue there is no such thing as excess life and the fact that a living being is goingto die does not justify experimenting on it or exploiting it as a natural resource.At its core, this issue forces us to confront fundamental questions about the beginnings of lifeand the ends of science. It lives at a difficult moral intersection, juxtaposing the need toprotect life in all its phases with the prospect of saving and improving life in all its stages.As the discoveries of modern science create tremendous hope, they also lay vast ethical minefields.As the genius of science extends the horizons of what we can do, we increasingly confrontcomplex questions about what we should do. We have arrived at that brave new world thatseemed so distant in 1932 when Alduous Huxley wrote about human beings created in testtubes in what he called a hatchery.In recent weeks, we learned that scientists have created human embryos in test tubes solelyto experiment on them. This is deeply troubling and a warning sign that should prompt all ofus to  think through these issues very carefully.Embryonic stem cell research is at the leading edge of a series of moral hazards. The initialstem cell researcher was at first reluctant to begin his research, fearing it might be used forhuman cloning. Scientists have already cloned a sheep. Researchers are telling us the nextstep could be to clone human beings to create individual designer stem cells, essentially togrow another you, to be available in case you need another heart or lung or liver.I strongly oppose human cloning, as do most Americans. We recoil at the idea of growinghuman beings for spare body parts or creating life for our convenience. And while we must devote enormous energy to conquering disease, it is equally importantthat we pay attention to the moral concerns raised by the new frontier of human embryo stemcell research. Even the most noble ends do not justify any means.My position on these issues is shaped by deeply held beliefs. I'm a strong supporter of scienceand technology, and believe they have the potential for incredible good -- to improve lives, tosave life, to conquer disease. Research offers hope that millions of our loved ones may becured of a disease and rid of their suffering. I have friends whose children suffer from juvenilediabetes. Nancy Reagan has written me about President Reagan's struggle with Alzheimer's.My own family has confronted the tragedy of childhood leukemia. And like all Americans, Ihave great hope for cures.I also believe human life is a sacred gift from our creator. I worry about a culture thatdevalues life, and believe as your president I have an important obligation to foster andencourage respect for life in America and throughout the world.And while we're all hopeful about the potential of this research, no one can be certain that thescience will live up to the hope it has generated.Eight years ago, scientists believed fetal tissue research offered great hope for cures andtreatments, yet the progress to date has not lived up to its initial expectations. Embryonicstem cell research offers both great promise and great peril, so I have decided we mustproceed with great care.As a result of private research, more than 60 genetically diverse stem cell lines already exist.They were created from embryos that have already been destroyed, and they have the abilityto regenerate themselves indefinitely, creating ongoing opportunities for research.I have concluded that we should allow federal funds to be used for research on these existingstem cell lines, where the life-and- death decision has already been made.Leading scientists tell me research on these 60 lines has great promise that could lead tobreakthrough therapies and cures. This allows us to explore the promise and potential of stemcell research without crossing a fundamental moral line by providing taxpayer funding that wouldsanction or encourage further destruction of human embryos that have at least the potentialfor life.I also believe that great scientific progress can be made through aggressive federal funding ofresearch on umbilical cord, placenta, adult and animal stem cells, which do not involve thesame moral dilemma. This year your government will spent $250 million on this importantresearch.I will also name a president's council to monitor stem cell research, to recommend appropriateguidelines and regulations and to consider all of the medical and ethical ramifications of bio-medical innovation.This council will consist of leading scientists, doctors, ethicists, lawyers, theologians andothers, and will be chaired by Dr. Leon Cass, a leading bio-medical ethicist from the Universityof Chicago.This council will keep us apprised of new developments and give our nation a forum tocontinue to discuss and evaluate these important issues.As we go forward, I hope we will always be guided by both intellect and heart, by both ourcapabilities and our conscience. I have made this decision with great care, and I pray it is the right one.Thank you for listening. Good night, and God bless America.",bush
"Thank you all. Deputy Secretary England, thanks for the introduction. One boss may not behere, but the other one is. I appreciate your kind words. I'm pleased to be back here with themen and women of the Defense Department.On this day in 2003, the United States began Operation Iraqi Freedom. As the campaignunfolded, tens and thousands of our troops poured across the Iraqi border to liberate the Iraqipeople and remove a regime that threatened free nations.Five years into this battle, there is an understandable debate over whether the war was worthfighting, whether the fight is worth winning, and whether we can win it. The answers are clearto me: Removing Saddam Hussein from power was the right decision -- and this is a fightAmerica can and must win.The men and women who crossed into Iraq five years ago removed a tyrant, liberated acountry, and rescued millions from unspeakable horrors. Some of those troops are with ustoday, and you need to know that the American people are proud of your accomplishment --and so is the Commander in Chief.I appreciate Admiral Mullen, the Joint Chiefs who are here. Thanks for coming. SecretaryDonald Winter of the Navy. Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte is with us. AdmiralThad Allen of the Coast Guard is with us. Ambassador from Iraq is with us -- Mr. Ambassador,we're proud to have you here. Soldiers, Sailors, Marines, Airmen and Coastmen -- CoastGuardmen [sic], thanks for coming, thanks for wearing the uniform. Men and women of theDepartment of State are here as well. Operation Iraqi Freedom was a remarkable display of military effectiveness. Forces from theUK, Australia, Poland and other allies joined our troops in the initial operations. As theyadvanced, our troops fought their way through sand storms so intense that they blackenedthe daytime sky. Our troops engaged in pitched battles with the Fedayeen Saddam -- deathsquads acting on the orders of Saddam Hussein that obeyed neither the conventions of warnor the dictates of conscience. These death squads hid in schools and they hid in hospitals,hoping to draw fire against Iraqi civilians. They used women and children as human shields.They stopped at nothing in their efforts to prevent us from prevailing -- but they couldn't stopthe coalition advance. Aided by the most effective and precise air campaign in history, coalition forces raced across350 miles of enemy territory -- destroying Republican Guard Divisions, pushing through theKarbala Gap, capturing Saddam International Airport, and liberating Baghdad in less than onemonth.Along the way, our troops added new chapters to the story of Americanmilitary heroism. During these first weeks of battle, Army Sergeant First Class Paul Ray Smithand his troops came under a surprise attack by about a hundred Republican Guard forces.Sergeant Smith rallied his men; he led a counterattack -- killing as many as 50 enemysoldiers before being fatally wounded. His actions saved the lives of more than a hundredAmerican troops -- and earned him the Medal of Honor.Today, in light of the challenges we have faced in Iraq, some look back and call this period theeasy part of the war. Yet there was nothing easy about it. The liberation of Iraq tookincredible skill and amazing courage. And the speed, precision and brilliant execution of thecampaign will be studied by military historians for years to come.What our troops found in Iraq following Saddam's removal was horrifying. They uncoveredchildren's prisons, and torture chambers, and rape rooms where Iraqi women were violated infront of their families. They found videos showing regime thugs mutilating Iraqis deemeddisloyal to Saddam. And across the Iraqi countryside they uncovered mass graves ofthousands executed by the regime.Because we acted, Saddam Hussein no longer fills fields with the remains of innocent men,women and children. Because we acted, Saddam's torture chambers and rape rooms andchildren's prisons have been closed for good. Because we acted, Saddam's regime is no longerinvading its neighbors or attacking them with chemical weapons and ballistic missiles. Becausewe acted, Saddam's regime is no longer paying the families of suicide bombers in the HolyLand. Because we acted, Saddam's regime is no longer shooting at American and Britishaircraft patrolling the no-fly zones and defying the will of the United Nations. Because weacted, the world is better and United States of America is safer.When the Iraqi regime was removed, it did not lay down its arms and surrender. Instead,former regime elements took off their uniforms and faded into the countryside to fight theemergence of a free Iraq. And then they were joined by foreign terrorists who were seeking tostop the advance of liberty in the Middle East and seeking to establish safe havens from whichto plot new attacks across the world.The battle in Iraq has been longer and harder and more costly than we anticipated -- but it isa fight we must win. So our troops have engaged these enemies with courage anddetermination. And as they've battled the terrorists and extremists in Iraq, they have helpedthe Iraqi people reclaim their nation, and helped a young democracy rise from the rubble ofSaddam Hussein's tyranny.Over the past five years, we have seen moments of triumph and moments of tragedy. Wehave watched in admiration as 12 million Iraqis defied the terrorists and went to the polls, andchose their leaders in free elections. We have watched in horror as al Qaeda beheadedinnocent captives, and sent suicide bombers to blow up mosques and markets. These actionsshow the brutal nature of the enemy in Iraq. And they serve as a grim reminder: Theterrorists who murder the innocent in the streets of Baghdad want to murder the innocent inthe streets of America. Defeating this enemy in Iraq will make it less likely that we'll face theenemy here at home.A little over a year ago, the fight in Iraq was faltering. Extremist elements were succeeding intheir efforts to plunge Iraq into chaos. They had established safe havens in many parts of thecountry. They were creating divisions among the Iraqis along sectarian lines. And theirstrategy of using violence in Iraq to cause divisions in America was working -- as pressuresbuilt here in Washington for withdrawal before the job was done.My Administration understood that America could not retreat in the face of terror. And weknew that if we did not act, the violence that had been consuming Iraq would worsen, andspread, and could eventually reach genocidal levels. Baghdad could have disintegrated into acontagion of killing, and Iraq could have descended into full-blown sectarian warfare.So we reviewed the strategy -- and changed course in Iraq. We sent reinforcements into thecountry in a dramatic policy shift that is now known as ""the surge."" General David Petraeustook command with a new mission: Work with Iraqi forces to protect the Iraqi people,pressure [sic] the enemy into strongholds, and deny the terrorists sanctuary anywhere in thecountry. And that is precisely what we have done.In Anbar, Sunni tribal leaders had grown tired of al Qaeda's brutality and started a popularuprising, called the ""Anbar Awakening."" To take advantage of this opportunity, we sent 4,000additional Marines to help these brave Iraqis drive al Qaeda from the province. As this effortsucceeded, it inspired other Iraqis to take up the fight. Soon similar uprisings began to spreadacross the country. Today there are more than 90,000 concerned local citizens who areprotecting their communities from the terrorists and insurgents and the extremists. Thegovernment in Baghdad has stepped forward with a surge of its own -- they've added morethan 100,000 new Iraqi soldiers and police during the past year. These Iraqi troops havefought bravely, and thousands have given their lives in this struggle.Together, these Americans and Iraqi forces have driven the terrorists from many of thesanctuaries they once held. Now the terrorists have gathered in and around the northern Iraqicity of Mosul -- and Iraqi and American forces are relentlessly pursuing them. There will betough fighting in Mosul and areas of northern Iraq in the weeks ahead. But there's no doubt inmy mind, because of the courage of our troops and the bravery of the Iraqis, the al Qaedaterrorists in this region will suffer the same fate as al Qaeda suffered elsewhere in Iraq.As we have fought al Qaeda, coalition and Iraqi forces have also taken the fight to Shiaextremist groups -- many of them backed and financed and armed by Iran. A year ago thesegroups were on the rise. Today, they are increasingly isolated, and Iraqis of all faiths areputting their lives on the line to stop these extremists from hijacking their young democracy.To ensure that military progress in Iraq is quickly followed up with real improvements in dailylife, we have doubled the number of provincial reconstruction teams in Iraq. These teams ofcivilian experts are serving all Iraqi -- 18 Iraqi provinces, and they're helping to strengthenresponsible leaders, and build up local economies, and bring Iraqis together so thatreconciliation can happen from the ground up. They're very effective. They're helping giveordinary Iraqis confidence that by rejecting the extremists and reconciling with one another,they can claim their place in a free Iraq -- and build better lives for their families.There's still hard work to be done in Iraq. The gains we have made are fragile and reversible.But on this anniversary, the American people should know that since the surge began, thelevel of violence is significantly down, civilian deaths are down, sectarian killings are down,attacks on American forces are down. We have captured or killed thousands of extremists inIraq, including hundreds of key al Qaeda leaders and operatives. Our men and women inuniform are performing with characteristic honor and valor. The surge is working. And as areturn on our success in Iraq, we've begun bringing some of our troops home.The surge has done more than turn the situation in Iraq around -- it has opened the door to amajor strategic victory in the broader war on terror. For the terrorists, Iraq was supposed tobe the place where al Qaeda rallied Arab masses to drive America out. Instead, Iraq hasbecome the place where Arabs joined with Americans to drive al Qaeda out. In Iraq, we arewitnessing the first large-scale Arab uprising against Osama bin Laden, his grim ideology, andhis murderous network. And the significance of this development cannot be overstated.The terrorist movement feeds on a sense of inevitability, and claims to rise on the tide ofhistory. The accomplishments of the surge in Iraq are exposing this myth and discrediting theextremists. When Iraqi and American forces finish the job, the effects will reverberate farbeyond Iraq's borders. Osama bin Laden once said: ""When people see a strong horse and aweak horse, by nature they will like the strong horse."" By defeating al Qaeda in Iraq, we willshow the world that al Qaeda is the weak horse. We will show that men and women who loveliberty can defeat the terrorists. And we will show that the future of the Middle East does notbelong to terror -- the future of the Middle East belongs to freedom.The challenge in the period ahead is to consolidate the gains we have made and seal theextremists' defeat. We have learned through hard experience what happens when we pull ourforces back too fast -- the terrorists and extremists step in, they fill vacuums, establish safehavens, and use them to spread chaos and carnage. General Petraeus has warned that toofast a drawdown could result in such an unraveling -- with al Qaeda and insurgents and militiaextremists regaining lost ground and increasing violence. Men and women of the Armed Forces: Having come so far, and achieved so much, we're notgoing to let this to happen.Next month, General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker will come to Washington to testifybefore Congress. I will await their recommendations before making decisions on our trooplevels in Iraq. Any further drawdown will be based on conditions on the ground and therecommendations of our commanders -- and they must not jeopardize the hard-fought gainsour troops and civilians have made over the past year. The successes we are seeing in Iraq are undeniable -- yet some in Washington still call forretreat. War critics can no longer credibly argue that we're losing in Iraq -- so now they arguethe war costs too much. In recent months we've heard exaggerated estimates of the costs ofthis war. No one would argue that this war has not come at a high cost in lives and treasure --but those costs are necessary when we consider the cost of a strategic victory for our enemiesin Iraq. If we were to allow our enemies to prevail in Iraq, the violence that is now declining wouldaccelerate -- and Iraq would descend into chaos. Al Qaeda would regain its lost sanctuariesand establish new ones -- fomenting violence and terror that could spread beyond Iraq'sborders, with serious consequences for the world's economy. Out of such chaos in Iraq, the terrorist movement could emerge emboldened -- with newrecruits, new resources, and an even greater determination to dominate the region and harmAmerica. An emboldened al Qaeda with access to Iraq's oil resources could pursue itsambitions to acquire weapons of mass destruction to attack America and other free nations.Iran would be emboldened as well -- with a renewed determination to develop nuclearweapons and impose its brand of hegemony across the Middle East. Our enemies would seean America -- an American failure in Iraq as evidence of weakness and a lack of resolve. To allow this to happen would be to ignore the lessons of September the 11th and make itmore likely that America would suffer another attack like the one we experienced that day -- aday in which 19 armed men with box cutters killed nearly 3,000 people in our -- on our soil; aday after which in the following of that attack more than one million Americans lost work, losttheir jobs. The terrorists intend even greater harm to our country. And we have no greaterresponsibility than to defeat our enemies across the world so that they cannot carry out suchan attack.As our coalition fights the enemy in Iraq, we've stayed on the offensive on other fronts in thewar on terror. Just a few weeks before commencing Operation Iraqi Freedom, U.S. forcescaptured Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind behind the September the 11th terroristattacks; we got him in Pakistan. About the same time as we launched Operation IraqiFreedom, coalition forces, thousands of -- hundreds of miles away launched an assault on theterrorists in the mountains of southern Afghanistan in an operation called Operation ValiantStrike. Throughout the war on terror, we have brought the enemy -- we have fought the enemy onevery single battlefront. And so long as the terrorist danger remains, the United States ofAmerica will continue to fight the enemy wherever it makes its stand. We will stay on theoffense. But in the long run, defeating the terrorists requires an alternative to their murderousideology. And there we have another advantage -- we've got a singular advantage with ourmilitary when it comes to finding the terrorists and bringing them to justice. And we haveanother advantage in our strong belief in the transformative power of liberty. So we're helping the people of Iraq establish a democracy in the heart of the Middle East. Afree Iraq will fight terrorists instead of harboring them. A free Iraq will be an example forothers of the power of liberty to change the societies and to displace despair with hope. Byspreading the hope of liberty in the Middle East, we will help free societies take root -- andwhen they do, freedom will yield the peace that we all desire. Our troops on the front lines understand what is at stake. They know that the mission in Iraqhas been difficult and has been trying for our nation -- because they're the ones who'vecarried most of the burdens. They are all volunteers, who have stepped forward to defendAmerica in a time of danger -- and some of them have gone out of their way to return to thefight. One of these brave Americans is a Marine Gunnery Sergeant named William ""Spanky"" Gibson.In May of 2006 in Ramadi, a terrorist sniper's bullet ripped through his left knee -- doctorsthen amputated his leg. After months of difficult rehabilitation, Spanky was not only walking --he was training for triathlons.Last year, at the ""Escape from Alcatraz"" swim near San Francisco, he met Marine GeneralJames Mattis, who asked if there's anything he could do for him. Spanky had just onerequest: He asked to re-deploy to Iraq. Today he's serving in Fallujah -- the first full-legamputee to return to the front lines. Here's what he says about his decision to return: TheIraqis are where we were 232 years ago as a nation. Now they're starting a new nation, andthat's one of my big reasons for coming back here. I wanted to tell the people of this countrythat I'm back to help wherever I can. When Americans like Spanky Gibson serve on our side, the enemy in Iraq doesn't got achance. We're grateful to all the brave men and women of our military who have served thecause of freedom. You've done the hard work, far from home and from your loved ones. Wegive thanks for all our military families who love you and have supported you in this mission. We appreciate the fine civilians from many departments who serve alongside you. Many ofyou served in Iraq and Afghanistan -- and some have been on these fronts several times. Youwill never forget the people who fought at your side. You will always remember the comradeswho served with you in combat [but] did not make the journey home. America remembersthem as well. More than 4,400 men and women have given their lives in the war on terror.We'll pray for their families. We'll always honor their memory. The best way we can honor them is by making sure that their sacrifice was not in vain. Fiveyears ago tonight, I promised the American people that in the struggle ahead ""we will acceptno outcome but victory."" Today, standing before men and women who helped liberate anation, I reaffirm the commitment. The battle in Iraq is noble, it is necessary, and it is just.And with your courage, the battle in Iraq will end in victory.God bless.",bush
"Holy Father, Laura and I are privileged to have you here at the White House. We welcome youwith the ancient words commended by Saint Augustine: ""Pax Tecum."" Peace be with you.You've chosen to visit America on your birthday. Well, birthdays are traditionally spent withclose friends, so our entire nation is moved and honored that you've decided to share thisspecial day with us. We wish you much health and happiness -- today and for many years tocome.This is your first trip to the United States since you ascended to the Chair of Saint Peter. Youwill visit two of our greatest cities and meet countless Americans, including many who havetraveled from across the country to see with you and to share in the joy of this visit. Here inAmerica you'll find a nation of prayer. Each day millions of our citizens approach our Maker onbended knee, seeking His grace and giving thanks for the many blessings He bestows uponus. Millions of Americans have been praying for your visit, and millions look forward to prayingwith you this week.Here in America you'll find a nation of compassion. Americans believe that the measure of afree society is how we treat the weakest and most vulnerable among us. So each day citizensacross America answer the universal call to feed the hungry and comfort the sick and care forthe infirm. Each day across the world the United States is working to eradicate disease,alleviate poverty, promote peace and bring the light of hope to places still mired in thedarkness of tyranny and despair.Here in America you'll find a nation that welcomes the role of faith in the public square. Whenour Founders declared our nation's independence, they rested their case on an appeal to the""laws of nature, and of nature's God."" We believe in religious liberty. We also believe that alove for freedom and a common moral law are written into every human heart, and that theseconstitute the firm foundation on which any successful free society must be built.Here in America, you'll find a nation that is fully modern, yet guided by ancient and eternaltruths. The United States is the most innovative, creative and dynamic country on earth -- itis also among the most religious. In our nation, faith and reason coexist in harmony. This isone of our country's greatest strengths, and one of the reasons that our land remains abeacon of hope and opportunity for millions across the world.Most of all, Holy Father, you will find in America people whose hearts are open to yourmessage of hope. And America and the world need this message. In a world where someinvoke the name of God to justify acts of terror and murder and hate, we need your messagethat ""God is love."" And embracing this love is the surest way to save men from ""falling prey tothe teaching of fanaticism and terrorism.""In a world where some treat life as something to be debased and discarded, we need yourmessage that all human life is sacred, and that ""each of us is willed, each of us is loved"" --and your message that ""each of us is willed, each of us is loved, and each of us is necessary.""In a world where some no longer believe that we can distinguish between simple right andwrong, we need your message to reject this ""dictatorship of relativism,"" and embrace aculture of justice and truth.In a world where some see freedom as simply the right to do as they wish, we need yourmessage that true liberty requires us to live our freedom not just for ourselves, but ""in a spiritof mutual support.""Holy Father, thank you for making this journey to America. Our nation welcomes you. Weappreciate the example you set for the world, and we ask that you always keep us in yourprayers.",bush
"I just signed a -- a bill passed by the leaders of the Senate and House who have joined me tohonor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi with the Congressional Gold Medal. This is a fitting tribute to a courageous woman who speaks for freedom for all the people ofBurma, and who speaks in such a way that she's a powerful voice in contrast to the junta thatcurrently rules the country. Burma has been hit by a terrible natural disaster. Laura and I and members of the Senate andHouse here express our heartfelt sympathy to the people of Burma.The United States has made an initial aid contribution, but we want to do a lot more. We'reprepared to move U.S. Navy assets to help find those who've lost their lives, to help find themissing, to help stabilize the situation. But in order to do so, the military junta must allow ourdisaster assessment teams into the country.So our message is to the military rulers: Let the United States come and help you, help thepeople.Our hearts go out to the people of Burma. We want to help them deal with this terribledisaster. At the same time, of course, we want them to live in a free society. I want to thank you for your leadership, thank you for your determination to send a messagethat America stands with this courageous woman.Thank you.",bush
"President Peres, thank you, sir, for your hospitality. Mr. Prime Minister and Mrs. Olmert, it'sgreat to be with you. We consider you friends. Heads of state, thank you all for coming. Ithink it's a great tribute to this conference, as well as to Israel that so many heads of statehave come. Ex-heads of state and ex-leaders, thanks for being here. Save a seat in the ex-leader's club. Citizens of Israel, Laura and I loved coming to your beautiful country, and thankyou for your warm hospitality. Citizens of the United States, my fellow Americans: Spendfreely and behave yourselves.Distinguished guests, I really appreciate your warm welcome; and we are thrilled to be herewith one of America's closest friends. Laura and I are honored to represent the Americanpeople on the 60th anniversary of your independence. Happy birthday.As we celebrate the anniversary, it is useful to look back at the story of your founding. It is astory of how faith guided the Jewish people through centuries of bitter exile. It is a story ofhow those living behind ghetto walls and barbed wire never lost sight of Jerusalem. It is astory of how brave pioneers risked everything to redeem the promise of this land. It is amarvelous story. When Israel's founders gathered in Tel Aviv to sign your declaration of independence, thethreat of war loomed. But it could not overshadow the joy of people who had lived to see theirprayers answered. Celebrations broke out all across this land, and of course they broke out inAmerica, as well. In New York, young men and women danced the Hora in the streets. InWashington, a crowd gathered to watch a flag-raising ceremony outside the building thatwould become Israel's first embassy. After one man saw the flag bearing the Star of David, hesaid, ""I never thought I'd live to see this day.""Looking back 60 years later, it is important to remember what the founders of Israel had toovercome at every stage of the journey. They established one of the world's greatdemocracies in a region where democracy had few roots. They formed a unified army out ofimmigrants and refugees from many different countries. They planted the seeds of a moderneconomy in the sands of an ancient desert. In these accomplishments, we see the visionaryleadership of men and women like Herzl and Weizmann and Ben-Gurion and Golda Meir andRabin and Sharon -- and we honor each of them this evening.And looking back 60 years later, we've also got to remember the courage of President HarryS. Truman.  As Israel prepared to declare independence, President Truman faced a toughchoice over whether to recognize a new state. The future of Israel hung in the balance. AsChaim Weizmann told the President, he said, ""History and providence have placed this issue inyour hands."" And today we know that the forces of Providence could not have chosen a betterman than America's 33rd President.Eleven minutes after Israel came into existence, the United States became the first nation torecognize its independence. And because Harry Truman did what was right instead offollowing the conventional wisdom, we can say today that America is Israel's oldest and bestfriend in the world.With every passing year, the bonds of friendship between America and Israel have grownstronger. America stands for peace, and so does Israel. And as we stand in peace, we mustunderstand the realities of the world in which we live. We must be steadfast, and we must bestrong in the face of those who murder the innocent to achieve their objectives. And in thelong run, we share a powerful belief in a powerful weapon against the terrorists. We believethat the surest way to defeat the enemies of hatred is to advance the cause of hope to thecause of freedom -- liberty as the great alternative to tyranny and terror.Mr. President, and Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for inviting me to speak at the Knessettomorrow. I hear it's a place of many a sharp elbow. I'm looking forward to giving myspeech.    I'm not going to be throwing any elbows. But I will talk about the day when Ibelieve every child in the Middle East can live in peace and live in freedom. With trust in theRock of Israel, we know that day will come. And when it does, the United States of Americawill be at your side.God bless Israel, and God bless America.",bush
"President Peres and Mr. Prime Minister, Madam Speaker, thank very much for hosting thisspecial session. President Beinish, Leader of the Opposition, Netanyahu, Ministers, membersof the Knesset, distinguished guests: Shalom.Laura and I are thrilled to be back in Israel. We have been deeply moved by the celebrationsof the past two days. And this afternoon, I'm honored to stand before one of the world'sgreatest democratic assemblies and convey the wishes of the American people with thesewords: Yom Ha'atzmaut Sameach.1It is a -- It is a rare privilege -- It's a rare privilege for the American President to speak to theKnesset. Although the Prime Minister told me there's something even rarer -- to have just oneperson in this chamber speaking at a time. My only regret is that one of Israel's greatestleaders is not here to share this moment. He's a warrior for the ages, a man of peace, afriend. The prayers of the American people are with Ariel Sharon.We gather to mark a momentous occasion. Sixty years ago in Tel Aviv, David Ben-Gurionproclaimed Israel's independence, founded on the ""natural right of the Jewish people to bemasters of their own fate."" What followed was more than the establishment of a new country.It was the redemption of an ancient promise given to Abraham and Moses and David -- ahomeland for the chosen people Eretz Yisrael.2Eleven minutes later, on the orders of President Harry Truman, the United States was proudto be the first nation to recognize Israel's independence. And on this landmark anniversary,America is proud to be Israel's closest ally and best friend in the world.The alliance between our governments is unbreakable, yet the source of our friendship runsdeeper than any treaty. It is grounded in the shared spirit of our people, the bonds of theBook, the ties of the soul. When William Bradford stepped off the Mayflower in 1620, hequoted the words of Jeremiah: ""Come let us declare in Zion the word of God."" The founders ofmy country saw a new Promised Land and bestowed upon their towns names like Bethlehemand New Canaan. And in time, many Americans became passionate advocates for a Jewishstate.Centuries of suffering and sacrifice would pass before the dream was fulfilled. The Jewishpeople endured the agony of the pogroms, the tragedy of the Great War, and the horror of theHolocaust -- what Elie Wiesel called ""the kingdom of the night."" Soulless men took away livesand broke apart families. Yet they could not take away the spirit of the Jewish people, andthey could not break the promise of God. When news of Israel's freedom finally arrived, GoldaMeir, a fearless woman raised in Wisconsin, could summon only tears. She later said: ""For twothousand years we have waited for our deliverance. Now that it is here it is so great andwonderful that it surpasses human words.""The joy of independence was tempered by the outbreak of battle, a struggle that hascontinued for six decades. Yet in spite of the violence, in defiance of the threats, Israel hasbuilt a thriving democracy in the heart of the Holy Land. You have welcomed immigrants fromfar -- from the four corners of the Earth. You have forged a free and modern society based onthe love of liberty, a passion for justice, and a respect for human dignity. You have workedtirelessly for peace. You have fought valiantly for freedom.My country's admiration for Israel does not end there. When Americans look at Israel, we seea pioneer spirit that worked an agricultural miracle and now leads a high-tech revolution. Wesee world-class universities and a global leader in business and innovation and the arts. Wesee a resource more valuable than oil or gold: the talent and determination of a free peoplewho refuse to let any obstacle stand in the way of their destiny.I've been fortunate to see the character of Israel up close. I've touched the Western Wall. I'veseen the sun reflected in the Sea of Galilee. I have prayed at Yad -- Yad Vashem. And earliertoday I visited Masada, an inspiring monument to courage and sacrifice. At this historic site,Israeli soldiers swear an oath: ""Masada shall never fall again."" Citizens of Israel: Masada shallnever fall again, and America will be at your side.This anniversary is a time to reflect on the past. It's also an opportunity to look to the future.As we go forward, our alliance will be guided by clear principles -- shared convictions rooted inmoral clarity and unswayed by popularity polls or the shifting opinions of international elites.We believe in the matchless value of every man, woman, and child: So we insist thatthe people of Israel have the right to a decent, normal, and peaceful life, just like thecitizens of every other nation.We believe that democracy is the only way to ensure human rights: So we consider it asource of shame that the United Nations routinely passes more human rightsresolutions against the freest democracy in the Middle East than any other nation inthe world.We believe that religious liberty is fundamental to a civilized society: So we condemnanti-Semitism in all forms -- whether by those who openly question Israel's right toexist, or by others who quietly excuse them.We believe that free people should strive and sacrifice for peace: So we applaud thecourageous choices Israeli's leaders have made. We also believe that nations have aright to defend themselves and that no nation should ever be forced to negotiate withkillers pledged to its destruction.We believe that targeting innocent lives to achieve political objectives is always andeverywhere wrong: So we stand together against terror and extremism, and we willnever let down our guard or lose our resolve.The fight against terror and extremism is the defining challenge of our time. It's more than aclash of arms. It's a clash of visions, a great ideological struggle. On the one side are thosewho defend the ideals of justice and dignity with the power of reason and truth. On the otherside are those who pursue a narrow vision of cruelty and control by committing murder,inciting fear, and spreading lies.This struggle is waged with the technology of the 21st century, but at its core it is an ancientbattle between good and evil. The killers claim the mantle of Islam, but they are not religiousmen. No one who prays to the God of Abraham could strap a suicide vest to an innocent child,or blow up guiltless guests at a Passover Seder, or fly planes into office buildings filled withunsuspecting workers. In truth, the men who carry out these savage acts serve no higher goalthan their own desire for power. They accept no God before themselves. And they reserve aspecial hatred for the most ardent defenders of liberty, including Americans and Israelis.And that is why the founding charter of Hamas calls for the ""elimination"" of Israel. And that iswhy the followers of Hezbollah chant ""Death to Israel, Death to America!"" That is why Osamabin Laden teaches that ""the killing of Jews and Americans is one of the biggest duties."" Andthat is why the President of Iran dreams of returning the Middle East to the Middle Ages andcalls for Israel to be wiped off the map.There are good and decent people who cannot fathom the darkness in these men and try toexplain away their words. It's natural, but it is deadly wrong. As witnesses to evil in the past,we carry a solemn responsibility to take these words seriously. Jews and Americans have seenthe consequences of disregarding the words of leaders who espouse hatred. And that is amistake the world must not repeat in the 21st century.Some seem to believe that we should negotiate with the terrorists and radicals, as if someingenious argument will persuade them they have been wrong all along. We've heard thisfoolish delusion before. As Nazi tanks crossed into Poland in 1939, an American senatordeclared: ""Lord, if I could only have talked to Hitler, all this might have been avoided.""We have an obligation to call this what it is: the false comfort of appeasement, which hasbeen repeatedly discredited by history.Some people suggest if the United States w[ould] just break ties with Israel, all our problemsin the Middle East would go away. This is a tired argument that buys into the propaganda ofthe enemies of peace, and America utterly rejects it. Israel's population may be just overseven million. But when you confront terror and evil, you are 307 million strong, because theUnited States of America stands with you.America stands with you in breaking up terrorist networks and denying the extremistssanctuary. America stands with you in firmly opposing Iran's nuclear weapons ambitions.Permitting the world's leading sponsor of terror to possess the world's deadliest weaponswould be an unforgivable betrayal for future generations. For the sake of peace, the worldmust not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon.Ultimately, ultimately to prevail in this struggle, we must offer an alternative to the ideologyof the extremists by extending our vision of justice and tolerance and freedom and hope.These values are the self-evident right of all people, of all religions, in all the world becausethey are a gift from the Almighty God. Securing these rights is also the surest way to securepeace. Leaders who are accountable to their people will not pursue endless confrontation andbloodshed. Young people with a place in their society and a voice in their future are less likelyto search for meaning in radicalism. Societies where citizens can express their conscience andworship their God will not export violence, they will be partners in peace.The fundamental insight, that freedom yields peace, is the great lesson of the 20th century.Now our task is to apply it to the 21st. Nowhere is this work more urgent than here in theMiddle East. We must stand with the reformers working to break the old patterns of tyrannyand despair. We must give voice to millions of ordinary people who dream for a better life in afree society. We must confront the moral relativism that views all forms of government asequally acceptable and thereby consigns whole societies to slavery. Above all, we must havefaith in our values and ourselves and confidently pursue the expansion of liberty as the pathto a peaceful future.That future will be a dramatic departure from the Middle East of today. So as we mark 60years from Israel's founding, let us try to envision the region 60 years from now. This vision isnot going to arrive easily or overnight; it will encounter violent resistance. But if we and futurePresidents and future Knessets maintain our resolve and have faith in our ideals, here's theMiddle East that we can see:Israel will be celebrating the 120th anniversary as one of the world's greatdemocracies, a secure and flourishing homeland for the Jewish people.The Palestinian people will have the homeland they have long dreamed of anddeserved -- a democratic state that is governed by law, and respects human rights,and rejects terror.From Cairo to Riyadh to Baghdad and Beirut, people will live in free and independentsocieties, where a desire for peace is reinforced by ties of diplomacy and tourism andtrade.Iran and Syria will be peaceful nations, with today's oppressive -- oppression a distantmemory and where people are free to speak their minds and develop their God-giventalents.Al Qaeda and Hezbollah and Hamas will be defeated, as Muslims across the regionrecognize the emptiness of the terrorists' vision and the injustice of their cause.Overall, the Middle East will be characterized by a new period of tolerance andintegration. And this doesn't mean that Israel and its neighbors will be best of friends.But when leaders across the region answer to their people, they will focus theirenergies on schools and jobs, not on rocket attacks and suicide bombings.With this change, Israel will open a new hopeful chapter in which its people can live a normallife, and the dream of Herzl and the founders of 1948 can be fully and finally realized.This is a bold vision, and some will say it can never be achieved. But think about what wehave witnessed in our own time. When Europe was destroying itself through total war andgenocide, it was difficult to envision a continent that six decades later would be free and atpeace.When Japanese pilots were flying suicide missions into American battleships, it seemedimpossible that six decades later Japan would be a democracy, a lynchpin of security in Asia,and one of America's closest friends. And when waves of refugees arrived here in the desertwith nothing, surrounded by hostile armies, it was almost unimaginable that Israel would growinto one of the freest and most successful nations on the earth. Yet each one of these transformations took place. And a future of transformation is possible inthe Middle East, so long as a new generation of leaders has the courage to defeat the enemiesof freedom, to make the hard choices necessary for peace, and stand firm on the solid rock ofuniversal values. Sixty years ago, on the eve of Israel's independence, the last British soldiers departingJerusalem stopped at a building in the Jewish quarter of the Old City. An officer knocked onthe door and met a senior rabbi.3 The officer presented him with a short iron bar -- the key tothe Zion Gate -- and said it was the first time in 18 centuries that a key to the gates ofJerusalem had belonged to a Jew. His hands trembling, the rabbi offered a prayer ofthanksgiving to God, ""Who had granted us life and permitted us to reach this day."" Then heturned to the officer, and uttered the words Jews had awaited for so long: ""I accept this key inthe name of my people."" Over the past six decades, the Jewish people have established a state that would make thathumble rabbi proud. You've raised a modern society in the Promised Land, a light unto thenations that preserves the legacy of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. And you have built amighty democracy that will endure forever and can always count on the United States ofAmerica to be at your side.God bless.",bush
"Klaus, thank you very much. Thanks for inviting me. Klaus said, it's about time you showedup. Proud to be here. Laura and I are so honored that, Klaus, you gave us a chance to come. Ido want to thank President Mubarak and Mrs. Mubarak for their wonderful hospitality. I wantto thank the members of Congress who are here. I appreciate the heads of state who havejoined us. I thank the foreign ministers who are here, including my own, Secretary of StateCondoleezza Rice. And I want to thank the members of the Diplomatic Corps.Laura and I are delighted to be in Egypt, and we bring the warm wishes of the Americanpeople. We're proud of our long friendship with your citizens. We respect your remarkablehistory. And we're humbled to walk in the ancient land of pharaohs, where a great civilizationtook root and wrote some of the first chapters in the epic story of humanity. America is a much younger nation, but we've made our mark by advancing ideals as old asthe pyramids. Those ideals of liberty and justice have sparked a revolution across much of theworld. This hopeful movement made its way to places where dictators once reigned andpeaceful democracies seemed unimaginable: places like Chile and Indonesia and Poland andthe Philippines and South Korea. These nations have different histories and differenttraditions. Yet each made the same democratic transition, and they did it on their own terms.In these countries, millions every year are rising from poverty. Women are realizing overdueopportunities. And people of faith are finding the blessing of worshiping God in peace. All these changes took place in the second half of the 20th century. I strongly believe that ifleaders like those of you in this room act with vision and resolve, the first half of 21st centurycan be the time when similar advances reach the Middle East. This region is home to energeticpeople, a powerful spirit of enterprise, and tremendous resources. It is capable of a verybright future -- a future in which the Middle East is a place of innovation and discovery, drivenby free men and women. In recent years, we've seen hopeful beginnings toward this vision. Turkey, a nation with amajority Muslim population, is a prosperous modern democracy. Afghanistan under theleadership of President Karzai is overcoming the Taliban and building a free society. Iraqunder the leadership of Prime Minister Maliki is establishing a multi-ethnic democracy. Wehave seen the stirrings of reform from Morocco and Algeria to Jordan and the Gulf States. Andisolation from the outside world is being overcome by the most democratic of innovations: thecell phone and the Internet. America appreciates the challenges facing the Middle East. Yetthe light of liberty is beginning to shine. There is much to do to build on this momentum. From diversifying your economies, toinvesting in your people, to extending the reach of freedom, nations across the region have anopportunity to move forward with bold and confident reforms -- and lead the Middle East to itsrightful place as a center of progress and achievement.Taking your place as a center of progress and achievement requires economic reform. This isa time of strength for many of your nations' economies. Since 2004, economic growth in theregion has averaged more than 5 percent. Trade has expanded significantly. Technology hasadvanced rapidly. Foreign investment has increased dramatically. And unemployment rateshave decreased in many nations. Egypt, for example, has posted strong economic growth,developed some of the world's fastest growing telecommunications companies, and mademajor investments that will boost tourism and trade. In order for this economic progress toresult in permanent prosperity and an Egypt that reaches its full potential, however, economicreform must be accompanied by political reform. And I continue to hope that Egypt can leadthe region in political reform. This is also a time to prepare for the economic changes ahead. Rising price of oil has broughtgreat wealth to some in this region, but the supply of oil is limited, and nations like mine areaggressively developing alternatives to oil. Over time, as the world becomes less dependenton oil, nations in the Middle East will have to build more diverse and more dynamiceconomies. Your greatest asset in this quest is the entrepreneurial spirit of your people. The best way totake advantage of that spirit is to make reforms that unleash individual creativity andinnovation. Your economies will be more vibrant when citizens who dream of starting theirown companies can do so quickly, without high regulatory and registration costs. Youreconomies will be more dynamic when property rights are protected and risk-taking isencouraged -- not punished -- by law. Your economies will be more resilient when you adoptmodern agricultural techniques that make farmers more productive and the food supply moresecure. And your economies will have greater long-term prosperity when taxes are low and allyour citizens know that their innovation and hard work will be rewarded. One of the most powerful drivers of economic growth is free trade. So nations in this regionwould benefit greatly from breaking down barriers to trade with each other. And America willcontinue working to open up trade at every level. In recent years, the United States hascompleted free trade agreements with Jordan, Oman, Morocco, and Bahrain. America willcontinue to negotiate bilateral free trade agreements in the region. We strongly supportedSaudi Arabia's accession to the World Trade Organization, and we will continue to supportnations making the reforms necessary to join the institutions of a global economy.To break down trade barriers and ignite economic growth around the world, we will worktirelessly for a successful outcome to the Doha Round this year. As we seek to open new markets abroad, America will keep our markets open at home. Thereare voices in my country that urge America to adopt measures that would isolate us from theglobal economy. I firmly reject these calls for protectionism. We will continue to welcomeforeign investment and trade. And the United States of America will stay open for business. Taking your place as a center of progress and achievement requires investing in your people.Some analysts believe the Middle East and North Africa will need to create up to 100 millionnew jobs over the next 10 to 15 years just to keep up with population growth. The key torealizing this goal is an educated workforce. This starts early on, with primary schools that teach basic skills, such as reading and math,rather than indoctrinating children with ideologies of hatred. An educated workforce alsorequires good high schools and universities, where students are exposed to a variety of ideas,learn to think for themselves, and develop the capacity to innovate. Not long ago the regionmarked a hopeful milestone in higher education. In our meeting yesterday, President Karzaitold me he recently handed out diplomas to university graduates, including 300 degrees inmedicine, and a hundred degrees in engineering, and a lot of degrees to lawyers, and many ofthe recipients were women.People of the Middle East can count on the United States to be a strong partner in improvingyour educational systems. We are sponsoring training programs for teachers andadministrators in nations like Jordan and Morocco and Lebanon. We sponsored Englishlanguage programs where students can go for intensive language instruction. We havetranslated more than 80 children's books into Arabic. And we have developed new onlinecurricula for students from kindergarten through high school. It is also in America's interest to continue welcoming aspiring young adults from this regionfor higher education to the United States. There were understandable concerns about studentvisas after 9/11. My administration has worked hard to improve the visa process. And I'mpleased to report that we are issuing a growing numbers of student visas to young peoplefrom the Middle East. And that's the way it should be.And we'll continue to work to expand educational exchanges, because we benefit from thecontribution of foreign students who study in America because we're proud to train the world'sleaders of tomorrow and because we know there is no better antidote to the propaganda ofour enemies than firsthand experience with life in the United States of America. Building powerful economies also requires expanding the role of women in society. This is amatter of morality and of basic math. No nation that cuts off half its population fromopportunities will be as productive or prosperous as it could be. Women are a formidableforce, as I have seen in my own family and my own administration. As the nations of theMiddle East open up their laws and their societies to women, they are learning the same thing. I applaud Egypt. Egypt is a model for the development of professional women. In Afghanistan,girls who were once denied even a basic education are now going to school, and a wholegeneration of Afghans will grow up with the intellectual tools to lead their nation towardprosperity. In Iraq and Kuwait, women are joining political parties and running campaigns andserving in public office. In some Gulf States, women entrepreneurs are making a living and aname for themselves in the business world. Recently, I learned of a woman in Bahrain who owns her own shipping company. She startedwith a small office and two employees. When she first tried to register her business in her ownname, she was turned down. She attended a business training class and was the only womanto participate. And when she applied for a customs license, officials expressed surprisebecause no woman had ever asked for one before. And yet with hard work and determination, she turned her small company into a $2 millionenterprise. And this year, Huda Janahi was named one of the 50 most powerfulbusinesswomen in the Arab world. Huda is an inspiring example for the whole region. AndAmerica's message to other women in the Middle East is this: You have a great deal tocontribute, you should have a strong voice in leading your countries, and my nation looks tothe day when you have the rights and privileges you deserve. Taking your place as a center of progress and achievement requires extending the reach offreedom. Expanding freedom is vital to turning temporary wealth into lasting prosperity. Freesocieties stimulate competition in the marketplace.Free societies give people access to information they need to make informed and responsibledecisions. And free societies give citizens the rule of law, which exposes corruption and buildsconfidence in the future. Freedom is also the basis for a democratic system of government, which is the only fair andjust ordering of society and the only way to guarantee the God-given rights of all people.Democracies do not take the same shape; they develop at different speeds and in differentways, and they reflect the unique cultures and traditions of their people. There are skepticsabout democracy in this part of the world, I understand that. But as more people in the MiddleEast gain firsthand experience from freedom, many of the arguments against democracy arebeing discredited. For example, some say that democracy is a Western value that America seeks to impose onunwilling citizens. This is a condescending form of moral relativism. The truth is that freedomis a universal right -- the Almighty's gift to every man, woman, and child on the face of Earth.And as we've seen time and time again, when people are allowed to make a choice betweenfreedom and the alternative, they choose freedom. In Afghanistan, 8 million people defied theterrorist threats to vote for a democratic President. In Iraq, 12 million people waved ink-stained fingers to celebrate the first democratic election in decades. And in a recent survey ofthe Muslim world, there was overwhelming support for one of the central tenets of democracy,freedom of speech: 99 percent in Lebanon, 94 percent here in Egypt, and 92 percent in Iran. There are people who claim that democracy is incompatible with Islam. But the truth is thatdemocracies, by definition, make a place for people of religious belief. America is one of themost -- is one of the world's leading democracies, and we're also one of the most religiousnations in the world. More than three-quarters of our citizens believe in a higher power.Millions worship every week and pray every day. And they do so without fear of reprisal fromthe state. In our democracy, we would never punish a person for owning a Koran. We wouldnever issue a death sentence to someone for converting to Islam. Democracy does notthreaten Islam or any religion. Democracy is the only system of government that guaranteestheir protection.Some say any state that holds an election is a democracy. But true democracy requiresvigorous political parties allowed to engage in free and lively debate. True democracy requiresthe establishment of civic institutions that ensure an election's legitimacy and hold leadersaccountable. And true democracy requires competitive elections in which oppositioncandidates are allowed to campaign without fear or intimidation. Too often in the Middle East, politics has consisted of one leader in power and the oppositionin jail. America is deeply concerned about the plight of political prisoners in this region, as wellas democratic activists who are intimidated or repressed, newspapers and civil societyorganizations that are shut down, and dissidents whose voices are stifled. The time has comefor nations across the Middle East to abandon these practices, and treat their people withdignity and the respect they deserve. I call on all nations to release their prisoners ofconscience, open up their political debate, and trust their people to chart their future.The vision I have outlined today is shared by many in this region -- but unfortunately, thereare some spoilers who stand in the way. Terrorist organizations and their state sponsors knowthey cannot survive in a free society, so they create chaos and take innocent lives in an effortto stop democracy from taking root. They are on the wrong side in a great ideological struggle-- and every nation committed to freedom and progress in the Middle East must standtogether to defeat them. We must stand with the Palestinian people, who have suffered for decades and earned theright to be a homeland of their own -- have a homeland of their own. I strongly support atwo-state solution -- a democratic Palestine based on law and justice that will live with peaceand security alongside a democrat Israel. I believe that the Palestinian people will build athriving democracy in which entrepreneurs pursue their dreams, and families own their homesin lively communities, and young people grow up with hope in the future. Last year at Annapolis, we made a hopeful beginning toward a peace negotiation that willoutline what this nation of Palestine will look like -- a contiguous state where Palestinians livein prosperity and dignity. A peace agreement is in the Palestinians' interests, it is in Israel'sinterests, it is in Arab states' interests, and it is in the world's interests. And I firmly believethat with leadership and courage, we can reach that peace agreement this year.This is a demanding task. It requires action on all sides. Palestinians must fight terror andcontinue to build the institutions of a free and peaceful society. Israel must make toughsacrifices for peace and ease the restrictions on the Palestinians. Arab states, especially oil-rich nations, must seize this opportunity to invest aggressively in the Palestinian people and tomove past their old resentments against Israel. And all nations in the region must standtogether in confronting Hamas, which is attempting to undermine efforts at peace with acts ofterror and violence. We must stand with the people of Lebanon in their struggle to build a sovereign andindependent democracy. This means opposing Hezbollah terrorists, funded by Iran, whorecently revealed their true intentions by taking up arms against the Lebanese people. It isnow clearer than ever that Hezbollah militias are the enemy of a free Lebanon -- and allnations, especially neighbors in the region, have an interest to help the Lebanese peopleprevail.We must stand with the people of Iraq and Afghanistan and other nations in the regionfighting against al Qaeda and other extremists. Bin Laden and his followers have made clearthat anyone who does not share their extremist ideology is fit for murder. That means everygovernment in the Middle East is a target of al Qaeda. And America is a target too. Andtogether, we will confront and we will defeat this threat to civilization. We must stand with the good and decent people of Iran and Syria, who deserve so muchbetter than the life they have today. Every peaceful nation in the region has an interest instopping these nations from supporting terrorism. And every peaceful nation in the region hasan interest in opposing Iran's nuclear weapons ambitions. To allow the world's leading sponsorof terror to gain the world's deadliest weapon would be an unforgivable betrayal of futuregenerations. For the sake of peace, the world must not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon.The changes I have discussed today will not come easily -- change never does. But the reformmovement in the Middle East has a powerful engine: demographics. Sixty percent of thepopulation is under 30 years old. Many of these young people surf the web, own cell phones,have satellite televisions. They have access to unprecedented amounts of information. Theysee what freedom has brought to millions of others and contrast that to what they have athome.Today, I have a message for these young people: Some tell -- some will tell you change isimpossible, but history has a way of surprising us, and change can happen more quickly thanwe expect. In the past century, one concept has transcended borders, cultures, andlanguages. In Arabic, ""hurriyya"" -- in English, ""freedom."" Across the world, the call forfreedom lives in our hearts, endures in our prayers, and joins humanity as one. I know these are trying times, but the future is in your hands -- and freedom and peace arewithin your grasp. Just imagine what this region could look like in 60 years. The Palestinianpeople will have the homeland they have long dreamed of and deserve -- a democratic statethat is governed by law, respects human rights, and rejects terror. Israel will be celebratingits 120 anniversary as one of the world's great democracies -- a secure and flourishinghomeland for the Jewish people. From Cairo, Riyadh, Baghdad to Beirut, people will live in free and independent societies,where a desire for peace is reinforced by ties of diplomacy and tourism and trade. Iran andSyria will be peaceful nations, where today's oppression is a distant memory and people arefree to speak their minds and develop their talents. Al Qaeda, Hezbollah, and Hamas will bedefeated, as Muslims across the region recognize the emptiness of the terrorists' vision andthe injustice of their cause. This vision is the same one I outlined in my address to the Israeli Knesset. Yet it's not aJewish vision or a Muslim vision, not an American vision or an Arab vision. It is a universalvision, based on the timeless principles of dignity and tolerance and justice -- and it unites allwho yearn for freedom and peace in this ancient land. Realizing this vision will not be easy. It will take time, and sacrifice, and resolve. Yet there isno doubt in my mind that you are up to the challenge -- and with your ingenuity and yourenterprise and your courage, this historic vision for the Middle East will be realized. May Godbe with you on the journey, and the United States of America always will be at your side. Thank you for having me.",bush
"Good evening. This is an extraordinary period for America's economy. Over the past fewweeks, many Americans have felt anxiety about their finances and their future. I understandtheir worry and their frustration. We've seen triple-digit swings in the stock market. Majorfinancial institutions have teetered on the edge of collapse, and some have failed. Asuncertainty has grown, many banks have restricted lending. Credit markets have frozen. Andfamilies and businesses have found it harder to borrow money. We're in the midst of a serious financial crisis, and the federal government is responding withdecisive action. We've boosted confidence in money market mutual funds, and acted toprevent major investors from intentionally driving down stocks for their own personal gain.Most importantly, my administration is working with Congress to address the root causebehind much of the instability in our markets. Financial assets related to home mortgageshave lost value during the housing decline. And the banks holding these assets have restrictedcredit. As a result, our entire economy is in danger. So I've proposed that the federalgovernment reduce the risk posed by these troubled assets, and supply urgently-neededmoney so banks and other financial institutions can avoid collapse and resume lending. This rescue effort is not aimed at preserving any individual company or industry -- it is aimedat preserving America's overall economy. It will help American consumers and businesses getcredit to meet their daily needs and create jobs. And it will help send a signal to marketsaround the world that America's financial system is back on track. I know many Americans have questions tonight: How did we reach this point in our economy?How will the solution I've proposed work? And what does this mean for your financial future?These are good questions, and they deserve clear answers. First, how did our economy reach this point? Well, most economists agree that the problems we are witnessing today developed over along period of time. For more than a decade, a massive amount of money flowed into theUnited States from investors abroad, because our country is an attractive and secure place todo business. This large influx of money to U.S. banks and financial institutions -- along withlow interest rates -- made it easier for Americans to get credit. These developments allowedmore families to borrow money for cars and homes and college tuition -- some for the firsttime. They allowed more entrepreneurs to get loans to start new businesses and create jobs. Unfortunately, there were also some serious negative consequences, particularly in thehousing market. Easy credit -- combined with the faulty assumption that home values wouldcontinue to rise -- led to excesses and bad decisions. Many mortgage lenders approved loansfor borrowers without carefully examining their ability to pay. Many borrowers took out loanslarger than they could afford, assuming that they could sell or refinance their homes at ahigher price later on.Optimism about housing values also led to a boom in home construction. Eventually thenumber of new houses exceeded the number of people willing to buy them. And with supplyexceeding demand, housing prices fell. And this created a problem: Borrowers with adjustablerate mortgages who had been planning to sell or refinance their homes at a higher price werestuck with homes worth less than expected -- along with mortgage payments they could notafford. As a result, many mortgage holders began to default. These widespread defaults had effects far beyond the housing market. See, in today'smortgage industry, home loans are often packaged together, and converted into financialproducts called ""mortgage-backed securities."" These securities were sold to investors aroundthe world. Many investors assumed these securities were trustworthy, and asked fewquestions about their actual value. Two of the leading purchasers of mortgage-backedsecurities were Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Because these companies were chartered byCongress, many believed they were guaranteed by the federal government. This allowed themto borrow enormous sums of money, fuel the market for questionable investments, and putour financial system at risk. The decline in the housing market set off a domino effect across our economy. When homevalues declined, borrowers defaulted on their mortgages, and investors holding mortgage-backed securities began to incur serious losses. Before long, these securities became sounreliable that they were not being bought or sold. Investment banks such as Bear Stearnsand Lehman Brothers found themselves saddled with large amounts of assets they could notsell. They ran out of the money needed to meet their immediate obligations. And they facedimminent collapse. Other banks found themselves in severe financial trouble. These banksbegan holding on to their money, and lending dried up, and the gears of the Americanfinancial system began grinding to a halt. With the situation becoming more precarious by the day, I faced a choice: To step in withdramatic government action, or to stand back and allow the irresponsible actions of some toundermine the financial security of all. I'm a strong believer in free enterprise. So my natural instinct is to oppose governmentintervention. I believe companies that make bad decisions should be allowed to go out ofbusiness. Under normal circumstances, I would have followed this course.But these are not normal circumstances. The market is not functioning properly. There's beena widespread loss of confidence. And major sectors of America's financial system are at risk ofshutting down. The government's top economic experts warn that without immediate action by Congress,America could slip into a financial panic, and a distressing scenario would unfold: More banks could fail, including some in your community. The stock market would drop evenmore, which would reduce the value of your retirement account. The value of your home couldplummet. Foreclosures would rise dramatically. And if you own a business or a farm, youwould find it harder and more expensive to get credit. More businesses would close theirdoors, and millions of Americans could lose their jobs. Even if you have good credit history, itwould be more difficult for you to get the loans you need to buy a car or send your children tocollege. And ultimately, our country could experience a long and painful recession. Fellow citizens: We must not let this happen. I appreciate the work of leaders from bothparties in both houses of Congress to address this problem -- and to make improvements tothe proposal my administration sent to them. There is a spirit of cooperation betweenDemocrats and Republicans, and between Congress and this administration. In that spirit, I'veinvited Senators McCain and Obama to join congressional leaders of both parties at the WhiteHouse tomorrow to help speed our discussions toward a bipartisan bill. I know that an economic rescue package will present a tough vote for many members ofCongress. It is difficult to pass a bill that commits so much of the taxpayers' hard-earnedmoney. I also understand the frustration of responsible Americans who pay their mortgageson time, file their tax returns every April 15th, and are reluctant to pay the cost of excesseson Wall Street. But given the situation we are facing, not passing a bill now would cost theseAmericans much more later. Many Americans are asking: How would a rescue plan work? After much discussion, there is now widespread agreement on the principles such a planwould include. It would remove the risk posed by the troubled assets -- including mortgage-backed securities -- now clogging the financial system. This would free banks to resume theflow of credit to American families and businesses.Any rescue plan should also be designed to ensure that taxpayers are protected. It shouldwelcome the participation of financial institutions large and small. It should make certain thatfailed executives do not receive a windfall from your tax dollars. It should establish abipartisan board to oversee the plan's implementation. And it should be enacted as soon aspossible. In close consultation with Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, Federal Reserve Chairman BenBernanke, and SEC Chairman Chris Cox, I announced a plan on Friday. First, the plan is bigenough to solve a serious problem. Under our proposal, the federal government would put upto $700 billion taxpayer dollars on the line to purchase troubled assets that are clogging thefinancial system. In the short term, this will free up banks to resume the flow of credit toAmerican families and businesses. And this will help our economy grow. Second, as markets have lost confidence in mortgage-backed securities, their prices havedropped sharply. Yet the value of many of these assets will likely be higher than their currentprice, because the vast majority of Americans will ultimately pay off their mortgages. Thegovernment is the one institution with the patience and resources to buy these assets at theircurrent low prices and hold them until markets return to normal. And when that happens,money will flow back to the Treasury as these assets are sold. And we expect that much, ifnot all, of the tax dollars we invest will be paid back. A final question is: What does this mean for your economic future? The primary steps -- purpose of the steps I have outlined tonight is to safeguard the financialsecurity of American workers and families and small businesses. The federal government alsocontinues to enforce laws and regulations protecting your money. The Treasury Departmentrecently offered government insurance for money market mutual funds. And through theFDIC, every savings account, checking account, and certificate of deposit is insured by thefederal government for up to $100,000. The FDIC has been in existence for 75 years, and noone has ever lost a penny on an insured deposit -- and this will not change. Once this crisis is resolved, there will be time to update our financial regulatory structures.Our 21st century global economy remains regulated largely by outdated 20th century laws.Recently, we've seen how one company can grow so large that its failure jeopardizes theentire financial system.Earlier this year, Secretary Paulson proposed a blueprint that would modernize our financialregulations. For example, the Federal Reserve would be authorized to take a closer look at theoperations of companies across the financial spectrum and ensure that their practices do notthreaten overall financial stability. There are other good ideas, and members of Congressshould consider them. As they do, they must ensure that efforts to regulate Wall Street do notend up hampering our economy's ability to grow. In the long run, Americans have good reason to be confident in our economic strength.Despite corrections in the marketplace and instances of abuse, democratic capitalism is thebest system ever devised. It has unleashed the talents and the productivity, andentrepreneurial spirit of our citizens. It has made this country the best place in the world toinvest and do business. And it gives our economy the flexibility and resilience to absorbshocks, adjust, and bounce back. Our economy is facing a moment of great challenge. But we've overcome tough challengesbefore -- and we will overcome this one. I know that Americans sometimes get discouragedby the tone in Washington, and the seemingly endless partisan struggles. Yet history hasshown that in times of real trial, elected officials rise to the occasion. And together, we willshow the world once again what kind of country America is -- a nation that tackles problemshead on, where leaders come together to meet great tests, and where people of everybackground can work hard, develop their talents, and realize their dreams. Thank you for listening. May God bless you.",bush
"Thank you. Welcome. Good morning.This is a special day for the White House. Laura and I are proud to welcome the greatestOlympic and Paralympic team ever assembled. And I bring greetings from the honorarycaptain of the Olympic teams -- President George H. W. Bush. We call him 41.I want to thank the members of the Cabinet who are here, and the administration. I want tothank the coaches and the team leaders, and the U.S. Olympic Committee leadership and stafffor being here. We welcome the representatives of Chicago 2016 who are here. Members ofthe U.S. Armed Forces, moms, dads, girlfriends, boyfriends, supporters of the mighty Olympicteam, we're glad you're here.I do want to welcome members of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports,including John Burke, the Chairman; Dot Richardson, the Vice Chairman -- by the way,member of the 1996 and 2000 U.S. Olympic gold medal softball teams.And the reason I want to mention them is today the Health and Human Services is issuing itsPhysical Fitness Guidelines, and there's no better time to remind our fellow citizens thatphysical fitness will lead to a healthy America. Just look what's happened to the peoplesurrounding me. And so we urge our fellow citizens to look at these guidelines and to taketime out of your day to exercise. Now, not every one of you has to ride a mountain bike. But ifyou walk just 20 minutes a day you'll help America and help yourself.Attending the Beijing Olympics was one of the great experiences of our lifetime. Laura and Ihad a fantastic experience. We will never forget the first night at the Bird's Nest for thespectacular Opening Ceremony. When the Team USA was announced, there was a notableincrease in the cheers. And then came the greatest sight of all -- more than 500 America's --of America's finest athletes marching behind our flag, carried by Bernard Lagat.1 It was anincredible sight, and I know it was a moment that all of our athletes looked forward to and it'sa moment that we were so honored to share with you.In the weeks that followed, our Olympic team took part in the largest games ever held. Over100,000 [sic]2 athletes competed in more than 300 events. An unprecedented 87 countriesbrought home medals. Forty-three world records were broken. About 4.7 billion viewerswatched the Olympics.And with the eyes of the world turned on Beijing, our teams rose to the occasion. The Olympicteam finished with the top medal count of 110 medals.But more impressive was the decency and character that these Olympics brought on the worldstage. I know you worked hard -- the Olympics and Paralympic teams worked hard to get tothis moment. Whether you won a medal or not, it really doesn't matter in the long run. Whatreally matters is the honor you brought to your sports and to your families and to yourcountry.And we thank you for the lasting memories that you gave us all. And so here are some of thelasting memories that I will take with me forever. First of all, the Water Cube -- watchingJason Lezak touch out I think it was the French team -- on the 4x100 freestyle relay, and thenwatching the joy of his teammates, including Michael Phelps.People say, did you ever get to meet Michael Phelps? I said I did. So that was the highlight? Isaid, not really; meeting his mother was more of a highlight. She reminded me of my mother-- plainspoken and full of love. So, Michael, we congratulate you. We thank you for joining us today. And we congratulate allthe swimmers for the Olympic team.And how about our gymnasts? Nastia Liukin and Shawn Johnson. What I found interesting wasthat these champions were roommates while they were competing for gold. And one wonderswhether or not that friendship would be damaged in the heat of the competition. The truth ofthe matter is, it wasn't. They showed the true Olympic spirit of being competitors in the gym,but being friends in the dorm. And so we welcome these two champions here today, and wethank you for setting such a good example.So, as you know, I'm a baseball guy, and have come to admire women's softball a lot.  Yes.So I know with us today are Finch, Duran, Abbot, Galindo, Lappin, Lowe, Berg and Watley --members of the U.S. Olympic women's softball team. I bring this up because I really think that these women are an inspiration to young girls allacross the globe, and the Olympics would be smart to keep women's softball as a part of itsprogram. And I want to thank you for welcoming [me] to your practice. I also want to welcome today a fellow Texan named Laura Wilkinson. At Sydney she stunnedthe world by taking gold. This summer, she returned to the Olympic stage for the third andfinal time, and she was fighting through injuries. But she brought such class to the arena.There was never any of this, ""Woe is me; how pitiful is life."" She said she was honored tocompete. She and her husband have returned home to the great state of Texas to raisemoney for a new diving center in The Woodlands, Texas. In other words, she had putsomething back into the community. And I urge all of us -- whether we're Olympic --Olympians or not to recognize the opportunity to make the communities in which we live abetter place. Laura, welcome and thank you for the example you have set.So I spent a little time at the beach volleyball arena. I got to meet Todd Rogers and PhilDalhausser. These two men are incredible athletes and they -- it was really interesting to bethere to watch them warm up. And then they introduced me to the Brazilian team and to theItalian team, and it was really a lot of fun -- but not nearly as much fun as spending time withMisty May-Treaner and Kerri Walsh.These two women are not only great athletes, they're really great people. And I'm just sosorry that Misty May got injured on Dancing [with] the Stars. God, if only she had me as apartner, you know? Except I can't dance. But I wish -- you know, it's interesting, I read acomment from Misty May today. She said, yes, I got hurt Dancing on [sic] the Stars, but I'llbe back at the 2012 Olympics.I also know that all of us were deeply touched by what happened to Hugh McCutcheon and hisfamily. Nevertheless, we were greatly inspired when the men's volleyball team rallied. Theywon an incredible gold medal against all odds to really help lift up the coach's family and hisspirits, as well as the whole nation's spirits. I congratulate the men and women's basketball teams. You can just imagine what it was likewhen the men's basketball team asked me to get in one of their huddles right before thegame against China. I was like a jockey. But they brought a lot of class to the courts, bothteams did. What impressed me and Laura was that the men were there cheering on thewomen, and the women were there cheering on the men. There was ample opportunity forpeople to ""big shot"" it at the Olympics. Not our athletes. They were there for the right reason,to support their teams and to support their nations, our nation.Now, one of the things that we really regret missing was the -- being in the Bird's Nest for the13th Paralympic Games. And we congratulate the athletes who are here, as well. Werecognize your hard work, and we're proud to call you Olympians.I'm particularly pleased to be here with those who have worn the uniform of our country. Onthe America team were 16 men and women who served the nation in uniform -- one of whomwas Army Lieutenant Melissa Stockwell. She lost her leg while serving our country in Iraq.Four years after hard work, four years after significant rehabilitation, she qualified as aswimmer. And her teammates elected her as the flag bearer for the Closing Ceremonies.We welcome you, Melissa, and we welcome you all.Long after we leave the White House, Laura and I will remember the extraordinary spirit andkindness of the athletes that we have met here at the White House and in Beijing. Oneunforgettable moment came after swimmer Larsen Jensen won the bronze medal in the 400freestyle relay. When he was presented his bouquet of flowers, he looked around the WaterCube and he made a special delivery: He climbed into the stands and he gave the bouquet toLaura. It was an incredibly kind gesture -- and by the way, Larsen, our anniversary is nextmonth if you'd like to go. He also told me something in private, where he said he looksforward to serving our country.Our Olympic athletes have served our country in many ways. But you have a chance tocontinue to serve. And we honor your service as athletes, and we look forward to honoringyour service as worthy citizens of our great country.You amazed the world with your talent and grace and sportsmanship. You inspired children tochase their dreams. You will be champions forever.May God bless you, and may God bless America.",bush
"Mr. Director, thank you for your kind introduction and thank you for your leadership. Proudthat you invited your wife, Ann, here to be with us. I thank the Attorney General for joining ustoday. Members of the FBI Academy staff, distinguished guests, family and friends, and mostimportantly, members of the graduating class: Thanks for having me.I am so pleased to be back to the FBI Academy, and to share with you this special day. Whenyou walk across the stage, you will receive your badge and your credentials. You'll becomespecial agents of the FBI. You will take your place on the front lines on the war on terror. Ithank you for stepping forward to serve your country during this important time. And onbehalf of all Americans, I congratulate the Class of 08-14.This academy has prepared you for the privileges and responsibilities of carrying the badge.Over the past 20 weeks, you have passed rigorous academic and physical requirements. Youhave spent hours practicing your aim on the firing range, combing the streets of Hogan'sAlley, and navigating the Academy's ""gerbil tubes."" As part of your training, you were allforced to endure the sting of pepper spray -- which you learned wasn't half as bad as thecafeteria food.To reach this day of accomplishment, you have all depended on the wisdom and advice ofyour instructors. They took a diverse group that includes combat veterans, police officers,firefighters, lawyers, language experts, and computer specialists. And they turned you into animpressive class of FBI special agents. Your instructors are proud of your accomplishments --and I know you are grateful for their leadership. To reach this day of accomplishment, you depended on the support of your loved ones. Whileyou were away training for this academy, some of them were really sweating out the trainingfor you.  And Rick mentioned a lot of you were packing bags. I'm thankful you didn't mentionCrawford, Texas.  And so are you.But the point is, America owes your families a great debt. And we thank you for standing byyour side -- thank them for standing by your side during this moment of training and theservice you'll be rendering to our country. We welcome the families here today.Members of this class join the FBI during a momentous time in our nation's history. Earlierthis summer the FBI celebrated its 100th anniversary. Unfortunately I wasn't able to attendthe official ceremony. So I asked the Attorney General to speak in my place. To be honest, Iwas somewhat concerned that he might not live up to my high standards of oratory.  He toldme I had nothing to worry about.The Bureau has come a long way since its founding. Over the past century, the FBI has grownfrom a small team of 34 investigators to a powerful force of more than 30,000 agents andanalysts and support professionals serving around the world. The FBI has pushed theboundaries of forensic science -- from mastering the art of fingerprints to pioneering the useof DNA evidence. The FBI has inspired generations of children to dream of joining the force. Sounds like I inspired one or two myself.In every era, the FBI has risen to meet new challenges. When mobsters brought crime andchaos to America's cities during the 1920s and '30s, the G-Men of the FBI brought them tojustice. When America entered the Second World War, the FBI stopped Axis agents fromcarrying out attacks on our homeland. During the Cold War, the FBI worked long hours toprotect America from Soviet spies. In all this work, the FBI has gained an incredible record ofachievement and has earned the admiration of the entire world. America honors all the finemen and women who have served in the ranks before you.As you go forth from this Academy, you're going to write a new chapter in the FBI's storiedhistory. In the years ahead, your assignments will be as diverse as the FBI's mission -- fromdismantling organized criminal networks, to pulling the plug on online predators, to makingwhite-collar criminals pay for defrauding hardworking Americans. And just as yourpredecessors adapted to meet the challenges of the past century, there's no doubt in my mindyou'll respond with courage to confront the emerging dangers of this new century.Those dangers became clear on September the 11th, 2001. On that day, 19 terrorists broughtdeath and destruction to our shores. We became a nation at war against violent extremists.And we must not rest until that war is won.More than seven years have passed without another attack on our soil. And this is not anaccident. Since 9/11, we have gone on the offense against the terrorists abroad -- so we donot have to face them here at home.  We stand with young democracies in Afghanistan andIraq and beyond as they seek to replace the hateful ideology of the extremists with a hopefulalternative of liberty.Here at home, we've transformed our national security institutions and have given ourintelligence and law enforcement professionals the tools and the resources they need to dotheir job, and that is to protect the American people. We formed a new Department ofHomeland Security. We created a new Director for National Intelligence. We established aprogram at the Central Intelligence Agency to interrogate key terrorist leaders captured in thewar on terror. We worked with Congress to pass legislation that allows our intelligenceprofessionals to quickly and effectively monitor terrorist communications while protecting thecivil liberties of our citizens. If al Qaeda is making a phone call into the United States, we needto know why and to whom they're calling in order to protect the American citizens.The FBI has played a vital role in doing the most important job that government has, and thatis to secure the American people from harm. Since 9/11, the Bureau has worked with ourpartners around the world to disrupt planned terrorist attacks. Most Americans will neverknow the full stories of how these attacks were stopped and how many lives were saved. Butwe know this: The men and women of the FBI are working tirelessly to keep our nation safe --and they have the thanks of the American people.The FBI's leadership in the war on terror has required a dramatic change of mission. Before9/11, terrorism was viewed primarily as a criminal matter. The FBI focused more on indictingterrorists after an attack than on stopping the attack in the first place. For example, after theterrorists targeted the World Trade Center in 1993, FBI agents succeeded in tracking downseveral of the killers. They obtained indictments against them and they put them behind bars.And that was good work. But eight years later al Qaeda returned to finish the job.Immediately after 9/11, the FBI made preventing terrorism its top priority. The FBI you jointoday is focused on collecting and analyzing intelligence -- so we can figure out what theterrorists are planning before it is too late. Over the past seven years, we have more thandoubled the number of intelligence analysts and translators on the force. We've enacted thePatriot Act to ensure FBI analysts and investigators have the information they need to protectour nation. We created the FBI's new National Security Branch -- bringing together divisionsresponsible for counterterrorism and intelligence and counterespionage.The FBI you join today is working more closely with partners at all levels of government. Atthe local level, we've increased the number of FBI Joint Terrorism Task Forces from 35 tomore than 100. These task forces bring together federal and local law enforcement agents.They have helped break up terror cells in places like Portland, Oregon; Buffalo, New York; andnorthern Virginia.At the national level, we created the National Counterterrorism Center, where the FBI isworking side by side with the CIA, the Homeland Security Department, and other federalagencies to track terrorist threats and prevent new attacks. We created the TerrorismScreening Center to consolidate watch lists from different agencies into one master list.At the international level, we've deployed the FBI to foreign countries to help track down theterrorists. Since September the 11th, the FBI has opened 16 new offices overseas. Two ofthem are in Kabul and Baghdad -- where hundreds of FBI agents are serving alongside ourbrave men and women in uniform.The FBI can be proud of all these accomplishments. These changes were difficult, and theywere necessary. We've transformed an agency founded a century ago to meet the challengesof the 21st century. And thanks to the vision and determination of the FBI, America is safertoday than we were on September the 11th, 2001.In the midst of this rapid change, we can be confident that one thing will never change -- andthat is the character and courage of those who carry the badge. We see this character andcourage in the story of an agent named Leonard Hatton. A bomb specialist for the FBI, Lennyhad investigated terrorist attacks around the world. So when he saw smoke rising from theWorld Trade Center on September the 11th, 2001, he immediately understood the danger.With complete disregard for his own life, he ran to the scene to help others escape. And whenthe towers came crashing down, Lenny died beneath them. Earlier that same morning, Lennyhad told his wife, ""Just another regular day at work."" Well, for a man like Lenny Hatton -- whoalways put others before himself -- it was another day at work. We must always honor thememory of this good and faithful servant -- and we vow that those who have given their livesin the war on terror shall never have died in vain.As new special agents, your charge to keep is to carry out this mission. I ask you to defendthe values of fidelity, bravery, and integrity that you have learned here at this Academy. I askyou to carry out your duty to protect the lives and liberties of the American people. If youfollow these principles, your careers will take you far, this agency will uphold its solemnresponsibility, and America's security will be in good hands.I want to thank you for sharing your graduation with me. I'm inspired by your examples ofservice. I wish you all the best in the future.May God bless you.",bush
"Good morning. Last night, I had a warm conversation with President-elect Barack Obama. Icongratulated him and Senator Biden on their impressive victory. I told the President-elect hecan count on complete cooperation from my Administration as he makes the transition to theWhite House. I also spoke to Senator John McCain. I congratulated him on a determined campaign that heand Governor Palin ran. The American people will always be grateful for the lifetime of serviceJohn McCain has devoted to this nation. And I know he'll continue to make tremendouscontributions to our country. No matter how they cast their ballots, all Americans can be proud of the history that wasmade yesterday. Across the country, citizens voted in large numbers. They showed a watchingworld the vitality of America's democracy, and the strides we have made toward a moreperfect union. They chose a President whose journey represents a triumph of the Americanstory -- a testament to hard work, optimism, and faith in the enduring promise of our nation.Many of our citizens thought they would never live to see that day. This moment is especiallyuplifting for a generation of Americans who witnessed the struggle for civil rights with theirown eyes -- and four decades later see a dream fulfilled. A long campaign has now ended, and we move forward as one nation. We're embarking on aperiod of change in Washington, yet there are some things that will not change. The UnitedStates government will stay vigilant in meeting its most important responsibility -- protectingthe American people. And the world can be certain this commitment will remain steadfastunder our next Commander-in-Chief. There's important work to do in the months ahead, and I will continue to conduct the people'sbusiness as long as this Office remains in my trust. During this time of transition, I will keepthe President-elect fully informed on important decisions. And when the time comes onJanuary the 20th, Laura and I will return home to Texas with treasured memories of our timehere -- and with profound gratitude for the honor of serving this amazing country. It will be a stirring sight to watch President Obama, his wife, Michelle, and their beautiful girlsstep through the doors of the White House. I know millions of Americans will be overcomewith pride at this inspiring moment that so many have awaited so long. I know SenatorObama's beloved mother and grandparents would have been thrilled to watch the child theyraised ascend the steps of the Capitol -- and take his oath to uphold the Constitution of thegreatest nation on the face of the earth.Last night I extended an invitation to the President-elect and Mrs. Obama to come to theWhite House. And Laura and I are looking forward to welcoming them as soon as possible. Thank you very much.",bush
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is a difficult moment for America.I, unfortunately, will be going back to Washington after my remarks. Secretary Rod Paige and[the] Lt. Governor will take the podium and discuss education. I do want to thank the folkshere at -- at Booker Elementary School for their hospitality.Today, we've had a national tragedy. Two airplanes have crashed into the World Trade Centerin an apparent terrorist attack on our country. I have spoken to the Vice President, to the Governor of New York, to the Director of the FBI,and have ordered that the full resources of the federal government go to help the victims andtheir families, and -- and to conduct a full-scale investigation to hunt down and to find thosefolks who committed this act.Terrorism against our nation will not stand.And now if you [would] join me in a moment of silence.May God bless the victims, their families, and America.Thank you very much.",bush
"Thank you all for coming. Mr. Vice President and Lynne, thank you for being here with us.Laura and I welcome you to the South Lawn -- better known as Barney's playground. I want to thank members of my Cabinet who've joined us. We've just finished a Cabinetmeeting, and it gave me a chance to tell them how much I appreciate the good work they'redoing during this critical time for our nation. I also appreciate the men and women who make up the Executive Office of the President forjoining us today. Some of you have been at the White House for just a few months. Othersarrived the same day that we did nearly eight years ago. You're the ones who can tell that myhair has gotten a little grayer.  Others are career employees who have been here for 30, or40, sometimes 50 years. I can tell that your hair has gotten grayer.The people on this lawn represent diverse backgrounds, talents, and experiences. Yet we allshare a steadfast devotion to the United States. We believe that service to our fellow citizensis a noble calling -- and the privilege of a lifetime.This is an exciting time for our country. Earlier this week, more than 120 million people votedfor a new President and Congress -- one of the largest turnouts in the history of the country.No matter how we cast our ballots, this election gives us all reason to be proud of ourdemocracy and our country. And I hope you will join Laura and me in congratulatingPresident-Elect Obama, and wishing him the very best for his family and our country.Just before our inauguration in 2001, Laura and I went back to Midland, Texas -- she wasborn there and I was raised there. I said that Laura and I would ""never quite settle inWashington."" I told them: ""While the honor is great, the work is temporary."" This is true formany of us here today. This peaceful transfer of power is one of the hallmarks of a truedemocracy. And ensuring that this transition is as smooth as possible is a priority for the restof my presidency. We face economic challenges that will not pause to let a new Presidentsettle in. This will also be America's first wartime presidential transition in four decades. We'rein a struggle against violent extremists determined to attack us -- and they would like nothingmore than to exploit this period of change to harm the American people. So over the next 75 days, all of us must ensure that the next President and his team can hitthe ground running. For more than a year now, departments and agencies throughout thefederal government have been preparing for a smooth transition. We've provided intelligencebriefings to the President-Elect, and the Department of Justice has approved securityclearances for members of his transition staff. In the coming weeks, we will ask administrationofficials to brief the Obama team on ongoing policy issues, ranging from the financial marketsto the war in Iraq. I look forward to discussing those issues with the President-Elect early nextweek. Offices within the White House are at work preparing extensive transition materials. We'repreparing career employees throughout the administration to take on added responsibilities tohelp prevent any disruption to the essential functions of the federal government. Taken together, these measures represent an unprecedented effort to ensure that theexecutive branch is prepared to fulfill its responsibilities at all times. As we carry out thistransition I know that you will continue to conduct yourselves with the decency andprofessionalism you have shown throughout my time in office.A successful transition is just one of many important tasks remaining in our last 75 days. Tohelp address the global financial crisis, the Secretary of Treasury is working endless hours,and I will host an international summit here in Washington on November the 15th. This will bea historic meeting -- and I'm confident that you will work hard to help make it a success. We'll also keep urging Congress to approve America's free trade agreements with Colombia,Panama, and South Korea. And we will continue to protect this homeland by defeating theterrorists and extremists abroad, so we do not have to face them here at home.As January 20th draws near, some of you may be anxious about finding a new job, or a newplace to live. I know how you feel. But between now and then, we must keep our attention onthe task at hand -- because the American people expect no less. Earlier this year, I promisedthat I would sprint to the finish. I am keeping that promise, and I know I have given some ofyou a good workout along the way. As we head into this final stretch, I ask you to remainfocused on the goals ahead. I will be honored to stand with you at the finish line.May God bless you.",bush
"Thank you. Tapper. We have been through a lot together. As I look through the room, I seeJake, Mike, Herman, Ann Compton. Just seemed like yesterday that -- that I was on thecampaign trail and you were analyzing my speeches and my policies. And I see a lot of facesthat travel with me around the world and -- to places like Afghanistan and Iraq and Africa. Isee some new faces, which goes to show there's some turnover in this business. Through it all, it's been -- I have respected you. Sometimes didn't like the stories that youwrote or reported on. Sometimes you ""misunderestimated"" me. But always the relationship Ihave felt has been professional. And I appreciate it. I appreciate -- I do appreciate working with you. My friends say, what is it like to deal with thepress corps? I said, these are just people trying to do the best they possibly can. And so here at the last press conference, I'm interested in answering some of your questions.But mostly I'm interested in saying thank you for the job. Ben.Question: Thank you for those comments, Mr. President. Here's a question. I'm wondering ifyou plan to ask Congress for the remaining 350 billion dollars in bail money. And in terms ofthe timing, if you do that before you leave office, sir, are you motivated in part to make life alittle easier for President-Elect Obama? President Bush: I have talked to the President-elect about this subject. And I told him that ifhe felt that he needed the 350 billion dollars, I would be willing to ask for it. In other words, ifhe felt it needed to happen on my watch. The best course of action, of course, is to convince enough members of the Senate to votepositively for the -- for the request. And, you know, that's all I can share with you, becausethat's all I know. Question: So you haven't made the request yet? President Bush: Well, he hasn't asked me to make the request yet. And I don't intend tomake the request unless he specifically asks me to make it. He's -- you know, I've had my third conversation with him, and I genuinely mean what I say.I wish him all the very best. I've found him to be a very smart and engaging person. And thatlunch the other day was interesting, to have two guys who are nearly 85, two 62-year-olders,and a 47-year-old -- kind of the classic generational statement. And one common area, at least the four of us, we all had different circumstances andexperiences, but one thing is we've all experienced what it means to assume the responsibilityof the presidency. And President-Elect Obama is fixing to do that. And he'll get sworn in, andthen they'll have the lunch and all the -- you know, all the deal up there on Capitol Hill. Andthen he'll come back and go through the inauguration and then he'll walk in the Oval Office,and there will be a moment when the responsibilities of the President land squarely on hisshoulders. Toby. Yes, we'll get everybody. Question: Thank you, Mr. President. Do you believe that the Gaza conflict will have ended bythe time you leave office? Do you approve of the way that Israel has conducted it? And whywere you unable to achieve the peace deal that you had sought?President Bush: Remind me of the three points, will you, because I'm getting -- Question: Will it end -- President Bush: -- I'm getting a little older. Question: Will it end by the time you leave office? Do you approve of the -- President Bush: I hope so. I'm for a sustainable cease-fire. And a definition of a sustainablecease-fire is that Hamas stops firing rockets into Israel. And there will not be a sustainablecease-fire if they continue firing rockets. I happen to believe the choice is Hamas's to make.And we believe that the best way to ensure that there is a sustainable cease-fire is to workwith Egypt to stop the smuggling of arms into the Gaza that enables Hamas to continue to firerockets. And so countries that supply weapons to Hamas have got to stop. And theinternational community needs to continue to pressure them to stop providing weapons. Hamas, obviously, if they're interested in a sustainable cease-fire, needs to stop arming. Andthen, of course, countries contingent to the Gaza need to work to stop the smuggling. And it'sa difficult -- difficult task. I mean, there's tunnels and, you know, great opportunities forpeople who want to continue to try to disrupt democracy to provide the weapons to do so. Second part of your question, please, ma'am? Question: Do you approve of the Israeli conduct in this? President Bush: I think Israel has a right to defend herself. Obviously in any of these kindsof situations, I would hope that she would continue to be mindful of innocent folks, and thatthey help, you know, expedite the delivery of humanitarian aid. And third, why haven't we achieved peace? That's a good question. It's been a long time sincethey've had peace in the Middle East. Step one is to have a vision for what peace would looklike. And in 2002, on the steps of the Rose Garden, I gave a speech about a two-state solution-- two states, two democracies living side by side in peace. And we have worked hard toadvance that idea. First thing is to convince all parties that the two states were necessary forpeace.And one thing that's happened is, is that most people in the Middle East now accept the two-state solution as the best way for peace. Most Palestinians want their own state, and mostIsraelis understand there needs to be a democracy on their border in order for there to belong-lasting peace. The challenge, of course, has been to lay out the conditions so that a peaceful state canemerge -- in other words, helping the Palestinians in the West Bank develop security forces,which we have worked hard to do over the past years. And those security forces are nowbecoming more efficient, and Prime Minister Fayyad is using them effectively. The challenge isto develop -- help the Palestinians develop a democracy -- I mean, and a vibrant economy intheir -- that will help lead to democracy. And the challenge, of course, is always complicated by the fact that people are willing tomurder to stop the advance of freedom. And so the -- Hamas, or for that matter al Qaeda, orother extremist groups, are willing to use violence to prevent free states from emerging. Andthat's the big challenge. And so the answer is -- will this ever happen? I think it will. And I know we have advanced theprocess. Yes, Suzanne. Finally got your name right, after how many years? Six years? Question: Eight years. President Bush: Eight years. You used to be known as Suzanne. Now you're ""Suz-ahn."" Question: ""Suz-ahn."" Thank you.President Bush: I'm ""Gahge.""Question: In your 2002 State of the Union address, you identified U.S. threats as an axis ofevil -- Iran, Iraq and North Korea. Iraq is relatively calm; North Korea is no longer on theterrorist threat list. How would you define, if, in fact, there is an axis of evil? And what is thegreatest and most urgent threat when it comes to security that Barack Obama has to dealwith?President Bush: The most urgent threat that he'll have to deal with, and other Presidentsafter him will have to deal with, is an attack on our homeland. You know, I wish I could reportthat's not the case, but there's still an enemy out there that would like to inflict damage onAmerica -- Americans. And that will be the major threat. North Korea is still a problem. There is a debate in the intel community about how big aproblem they are. But one of my concerns is that there might be a highly enriched uraniumprogram. And therefore it is really important that out of the six-party talks comes a strongverification regime. In other words, in order to advance our relations with North Korea, theNorth Korean government must honor the commitments it made to allow for strongverification measures to be in place, to ensure that they don't develop a highly enricheduranium program, for example. So they're still dangerous, and Iran is still dangerous. Yes. Question: You said in an interview earlier this weekend, one of these, I guess, exitinterviews, that -- President Bush: This is the ultimate exit interview. Question: -- that you think the Republican Party needs to be more inclusive. Who needs tohear that message inside the Republican Party? President Bush: You see, I am concerned that, in the wake of the defeat, that thetemptation will be to look inward and to say, well, here's a litmus test you must adhere to. This party will come back. But the party's message has got to be that different points of vieware included in the party. And -- take, for example, the immigration debate. That's obviously ahighly contentious issue. And the problem with the outcome of the initial round of the debatewas that some people said, well, Republicans don't like immigrants. Now, that may be fair orunfair, but that's what -- that's the image that came out.And, you know, if the image is we don't like immigrants, then there's probably somebody elseout there saying, well, if they don't like the immigrants, they probably don't like me, as well.And so my point was, is that our party has got to be compassionate and broad-minded. I remember the 1964 elections. My dad happened to be running for the United State Senatethen and, you know, got landslided with the Johnson landslide in the state of Texas. But itwasn't just George Bush who got defeated; the Republican Party was pretty well decimated atthe time. At least that's what they -- I think that's how the pundits viewed it. And then '66there was a resurgence. And the same thing can happen this time, but we just got to makesure our message is broad-gauged and compassionate; that we care about people's lives, andwe've got a plan to help them improve their lives. Jake, yes. How you doing? Question: I'm good. How you doing, sir? President Bush: So what have you been doing since 2000 -- never mind. Question: Working my way to this chair. President Bush: So are you going to be here for President Obama? Question: I will. I will. President Bush: That's a pretty cool job. Question: It's not bad. President Bush: Yes.Question: Yours might be better. President Bush: Yes -- what, retirement?Question: In the past, when you've been asked to address bad poll numbers or your ownpopularity, you've said that history will judge that you did the right thing, that you thoughtyou did the right thing. But without getting into your motives or your goals, I think a lot ofpeople, including Republicans, including some members of your own administration, havebeen disappointed at the execution of some of your ideals, whether Iraq or Katrina or theeconomy. What would your closing message be to the American people about the execution ofthese goals? President Bush: Well, first of all, hard things don't happen overnight, Jake. And when thehistory of Iraq is written, historians will analyze, for example, the decision on the surge. Thesituation was -- looked like it was going fine and then violence for a period of time began tothrow -- throw the progress of Iraq into doubt. And rather than accepting the status quo andsaying, oh, it's not worth it or the politics makes it difficult or, you know, the party may endup being -- you know, not doing well in the elections because of the violence in Iraq, I decidedto do something about it -- and sent 30,000 troops in as opposed to withdrawing. And so that part of history is certain, and the situation did change. Now the question is, in thelong run, will this democracy survive? And that's going to be the challenge for futurePresidents. In terms of the economy, look, I inherited a recession, I am ending on a recession. In themeantime there were 52 months of uninterrupted job growth. And I defended tax cuts when Icampaigned, I helped implement tax cuts when I was President, and I will defend them aftermy presidency as the right course of action. And there's a fundamental philosophical debateabout tax cuts. Who best can spend your money, the government or you? And I have alwayssided with the people on that issue. Now, obviously these are very difficult economic times. When people analyze the situation,there will be -- this problem started before my presidency, it obviously took place during mypresidency. The question facing a President is not when the problem started, but what did youdo about it when you recognized the problem. And I readily concede I chunked aside some ofmy free market principles when I was told by chief economic advisors that the situation wewere facing could be worse than the Great Depression.So I've told some of my friends who said -- you know, who have taken an ideological positionon this issue -- why did you do what you did? I said, well, if you were sitting there and heardthat the depression could be greater than the Great Depression, I hope you would act too,which I did. And we've taken extraordinary measures to deal with the frozen credit markets,which have affected the economy. Credit spreads are beginning to shrink; lending is justbeginning to pick up. The actions we have taken, I believe, have helped thaw the creditmarkets, which is the first step toward recovery. And so, yes, look, there's plenty of critics in this business; I understand that. And I thank youfor giving me a chance to defend a record that I am going to continue to defend, because Ithink it's a good, strong record. Jim. Question: Thank you, Mr. President. I'd also like to ask you about your critics. President Bush: Sure. You know any?Question: Well, a couple years ago, Charles Krauthammer, columnist and Harvard-trainedpsychiatrist, coined a term, ""Bush derangement syndrome,"" to talk about your critics whodisagreed with you most passionately -- not just your policies, but seemed to take ananimosity towards you. I'm just wondering, as you look back, why you think you engenderedsuch passionate criticism, animosity, and do you have any message specifically to those -- tothat particular part of the spectrum of your critics? President Bush: You know, most people I see, you know, when I'm moving around thecountry, for example, they're not angry. And they're not hostile people. And they -- we nevermeet people who disagree, that's just not true. I've met a lot of people who don't agree withthe decisions I make. But they have been civil in their discourse. And so, I view those who get angry and yell and say bad things and, you know, all that kind ofstuff, it's just a very few people in the country. I don't know why they get angry. I don't knowwhy they get hostile. It's not the first time, however, in history that people have expressedthemselves in sometimes undignified ways.I've been reading, you know, a lot about Abraham Lincoln during my presidency, and therewas some pretty harsh discord when it came to the 16th President, just like there's beenharsh discord for the 43rd President. You know, Presidents can try to avoid hard decisions and therefore avoid controversy. That'sjust not my nature. I'm the kind of person that, you know, is willing to take on hard tasks,and in times of war people get emotional; I understand that. Never really, you know, spentthat much time, frankly, worrying about the loud voices. I of course hear them, but theydidn't affect my policy, nor did they affect -- affect how I made decisions. You know, the -- President-Elect Obama will find this, too. He'll get in the Oval Office andthere will be a lot of people that are real critical and harsh, and he'll be disappointed at timesby the tone of the rhetoric. And he's going to have to do what he thinks is right, Jim. And ifyou don't, then I don't see how you can live with yourself. I don't see how I can get backhome in Texas and look in the mirror and be proud of what I see if I allowed the loud voices,the loud critics, to prevent me from doing what I thought was necessary to protect thiscountry. Mike. Question: Mr. President, thank you very much. Since your philosophy is so different fromPresident-Elect Obama's, what concerns you the most about what he may attempt to do? President Bush: You know, Michael, I'm not going to speculate about what he's going to do.It's going to be -- you know, he's going to get in the Oval Office, he's going to analyze eachsituation, and he's going to make the decisions that he think is necessary. And the other thing is, when I get out of here, I'm getting off the stage. I believe there oughtto be, you know, one person in the klieg lights at a time, and I've had my time in the klieglights. You know, I'm confident, you know, you'll catch me opining on occasion, but I wish himall the best. And people say, oh, you just -- that's just a throwaway line. No, it's not a throwaway line. Thestakes are high. There is an enemy that still is out there. You know, people can maybe try towrite that off as, you know, he's trying to set something up.I'm telling you there's an enemy that would like to attack America, Americans, again. Therejust is. That's the reality of the world. And I wish him all the very best. And of course, he's going to have his hands full with the economy. I understand. It's tough fora lot of working people out there. The people are concerned about their economic future. Youknow, one of the very difficult parts of the decision I made on the financial crisis was to usehardworking people's money to help prevent there to be a crisis, and in so doing, some of thatmoney went into Wall Street firms that caused the crisis in the first place. I wasn't kiddingwhen I said Wall Street got drunk and we got the hangover. And -- but nevertheless,President-Elect Obama will find the problems and the situations surrounding problemssometimes cause people to have to make decisions that they, you know, weren't initiallycomfortable with. And there was such a decision when it came to Wall Street. I mean, I had a lot of people -- when I went out to Midland that time -- say, what the heckare you doing? Those people up East caused the problem. I said, I know, but if we hadn'tworked to fix the problem, your situation would be worse. And -- anyway, I really do wish himall the best. Sheryl. Question: Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, in recent days, there's been a fair amountof discussion in legal circles about whether or not you might give preemptive pardons,pardons in advance, to officials of your administration who engaged in anything from harshinterrogation tactics to perhaps dismissing U.S. attorneys. I'd like to know, have you givenany consideration to this? And are you planning on it? President Bush: I won't be discussing pardons here at this press conference. Question: Can I have a follow-up? President Bush: Would you like to ask another question? Question: Yes, I would, sir. Thank you. Four years ago -- President Bush: That's the spirit, isn't it?Question: I appreciate that. President Bush: Thank you.Question: Four years ago, you were asked if you had made any mistakes. President Bush: Yes. Question: And I'm not trying to play ""gotcha,"" but I wonder, when you look back over thelong arc of your presidency, do you think, in retrospect, that you have made any mistakes?And if so, what is the single biggest mistake that you may have made? President Bush: Gotcha. I have often said that history will look back and determine thatwhich could have been done better, or, you know, mistakes I made. Clearly putting a ""MissionAccomplished"" on a aircraft carrier was a mistake. It sent the wrong message. We were tryingto say something differently, but nevertheless, it conveyed a different message. Obviously,some of my rhetoric has been a mistake. I've thought long and hard about Katrina -- you know, could I have done somethingdifferently, like land Air Force One either in New Orleans or Baton Rouge. The problem withthat and -- is that law enforcement would have been pulled away from the mission. And thenyour questions, I suspect, would have been, how could you possibly have flown Air Force Oneinto Baton Rouge, and police officers that were needed to expedite traffic out of New Orleanswere taken off the task to look after you? I believe that running the Social Security idea right after the '04 elections was a mistake. Ishould have argued for immigration reform. And the reason why is, is that -- you know, oneof the lessons I learned as governor of Texas, by the way, is legislative branches tend to berisk-adverse. In other words, sometimes legislatures have the tendency to ask, why should Itake on a hard task when a crisis is not imminent? And the crisis was not imminent for SocialSecurity as far as many members of Congress was concerned. As an aside, one thing I proved is that you can actually campaign on the issue and getelected. In other words, I don't believe talking about Social Security is the third rail ofAmerican politics. I, matter of fact, think that in the future, not talking about how you intendto fix Social Security is going to be the third rail of American politics.One thing about the presidency is that you can make -- only make decisions, you know, onthe information at hand. You don't get to have information after you've made the decision.That's not the way it works. And you stand by your decisions, and you do your best to explainwhy you made the decisions you made. There have been disappointments. Abu Ghraib obviously was a huge disappointment duringthe presidency. Not having weapons of mass destruction was a significant disappointment. Idon't know if you want to call those mistakes or not, but they were -- things didn't goaccording to plan, let's put it that way. Anyway, I think historians will look back and they'll be able to have a better look at mistakesafter some time has passed. Along Jake's question, there is no such thing as short-termhistory. I don't think you can possibly get the full breadth of an administration until time haspassed: Where does a President's -- did a President's decisions have the impact that hethought they would, or he thought they would, over time? Or how did this President compareto future Presidents, given a set of circumstances that may be similar or not similar? I mean,there's -- it's just impossible to do. And I'm comfortable with that. Yes, Mike. Question: One of the major objectives that the incoming administration has talked frequentlyabout is restoring America's moral standing in the world. And many of the allies of the newPresident -- I believe that the President-elect himself has talked about the damage thatGitmo, that harsh interrogation tactics that they consider torture, how going to war in Iraqwithout a U.N. mandate have damaged America's moral standing in the world. I'm wonderingbasically what is your reaction to that? Do you think that is that something that the nextPresident needs to worry about? President Bush: I strongly disagree with the assessment that our moral standing has beendamaged. It may be damaged amongst some of the elite, but people still understand Americastands for freedom, that America is a country that provides such great hope.You go to Africa, you ask Africans about America's generosity and compassion; go to India,and ask about, you know, America's -- their view of America. Go to China and ask. Now, noquestion parts of Europe have said that we shouldn't have gone to war in Iraq without amandate, but those are a few countries. Most countries in Europe listened to what 1441 said,which is disclose, disarm or face serious consequences. Most people take those words seriously. Now, some countries didn't -- even though theymight have voted for the resolution. I disagree with this assessment that, you know, peopleview America in a dim light. I just don't agree with that. And I understand that Gitmo hascreated controversies. But when it came time for those countries that were criticizing Americato take some of those -- some of those detainees, they weren't willing to help out. And so,you know, I just disagree with the assessment, Mike. I'll remind -- listen, I tell people, yes, you can try to be popular. In certain quarters in Europe,you can be popular by blaming every Middle Eastern problem on Israel. Or you can be popularby joining the International Criminal Court. I guess I could have been popular by acceptingKyoto, which I felt was a flawed treaty, and proposed something different and moreconstructive. And in terms of the decisions that I had made to protect the homeland, I wouldn't worry aboutpopularity. What I would worry about is the Constitution of the United States, and puttingplans in place that makes it easier to find out what the enemy is thinking, because all thesedebates will matter not if there's another attack on the homeland. The question won't be, youknow, were you critical of this plan or not; the question is going to be, why didn't you dosomething? Do you remember what it was like right after September the 11th around here? In pressconferences and opinion pieces and in stories -- that sometimes were news stories andsometimes opinion pieces -- people were saying, how come they didn't see it, how come theydidn't connect the dots? Do you remember what the environment was like in Washington? Ido. When people were hauled up in front of Congress and members of Congress were askingquestions about, how come you didn't know this, that, or the other? And then we start puttingpolicy in place -- legal policy in place to connect the dots, and all of a sudden people weresaying, how come you're connecting the dots?And so, Mike, I've heard all that. I've heard all that. My view is, is that most people aroundthe world, they respect America. And some of them doesn't like me, I understand that --some of the writers and the, you know, opiners and all that. That's fine, that's part of thedeal. But I'm more concerned about the country and our -- how people view the UnitedStates. They view us as strong, compassionate people who care deeply about the universalityof freedom. Roger. Question: Thank you. Mr. President, you spoke a moment ago about using taxpayers' moneyfor the TARP program. President Bush: Yes, I did. Question: The first $350 billion is out the door, it's been spent. Are you satisfied that it'sbeen spent wisely? And for the second $350 billion that's under consideration, do you think --are you supportive of Congress putting some restrictions on it? President Bush: I'm supportive of the President-elect working out a plan with Congress thatbest suits him -- and Congress. That's what he's going to have to do. He's going to have to goup there and he's going to have to make his case as to why the 350 [billion dollars] isnecessary. And he knows that. This is nothing new. And in terms of the first 350 [billion dollars,] I am pleased with this aspect of the expenditure,and that is that the financial markets are beginning to thaw. In the fall, I was concerned thatthe credit freeze would cause us to be headed toward a depression greater than the GreatDepression. That's what I was told, if we didn't move. And so, therefore, we have movedaggressively. And by the way, it just wasn't with the TARP. If you think about AIG, Fannie and Freddie -- alot of the decisions that were made in this administration are very aggressive decisions, allaiming at preventing the financial system from cratering.Question: Mr. President, you spoke of the moment that the responsibility of the office wouldhit Barack Obama. The world is a far different place than it was when it hit you. When do youthink he's going to feel the full impact? And what, if anything, have you and the otherPresidents shared with him about the effects of the sometimes isolation, the so-called bubbleof the office? President Bush: Yes, that's a great question. He'll -- he will feel the effects the minute hewalks in the Oval Office. At least, that's when I felt. I don't know when he's going -- he mayfeel it the minute he's -- gets sworn in. And the minute I got sworn in, I started thinkingabout the speech. And so -- but he's a better speech-maker than me, so he'll be able to --he'll be able to -- I don't know how he's going to feel. All I know is he's going to feel it. Therewill be a moment when he feels it. I have never felt isolated and I don't think he will. One reason he won't feel isolated isbecause he's got a fabulous family and he cares a lot about his family. That's evident from mydiscussions with him. He'll be -- he's a 45-second commute away from a great wife and twolittle girls that love him dearly. I believe this -- the phrase ""burdens of the office"" is overstated. You know, it's kind of like,why me? Oh, the burdens, you know. Why did the financial collapse have to happen on mywatch? It's just -- it's pathetic, isn't it, self-pity. And I don't believe that President-ElectObama will be full of self-pity. He will find -- you know, your -- the people that don't like you,the critics, they're pretty predictable. Sometimes the biggest disappointments will come fromyour so-called friends. And there will be disappointments, I promise you. He'll bedisappointed. On the other hand, the job is so exciting and so profound that thedisappointments will be clearly, you know, a minor irritant compared to the -- Question: It was never the ""loneliest office in the world"" for you? President Bush: No, not for me. We had a -- people -- we -- I had a fabulous team aroundme of highly dedicated, smart, capable people, and we had fun. I tell people that, you know,some days happy, some days not so happy, every day has been joyous. And people, they say,I just don't believe it to be the case.Well, it is the case. Even in the darkest moments of Iraq, you know, there was -- and everyday when I was reading the reports about soldiers losing their lives, no question there was alot of emotion, but also there was times where we could be light-hearted and support eachother. And I built a team of really capable people who were there not to serve me, or there to servethe Republicans, they were there to serve the country. And President-Elect Obama will find, ashe makes these tough calls and tough decisions, that he'll be supported by a lot of really goodpeople that care -- care about the country, as well. John. Question: You've talked a lot about your concerns over the rise of protectionism in thecurrent -- President Bush: Yes. Question: -- economic environment. What do you think the future holds for that? Do youthink the trend is a good one or a bad one? President Bush: I hope the trend is bad against protectionism. A disappointment -- not amistake, but a disappointment -- was not getting the three trade bills out of Congress onColombia, Panama and South Korea. That was a disappointment. I actually thought we had ashot at one time, and then I was disappointed that they didn't move out of the House. And I am concerned about protectionism. In tough economic times, the temptation is to say,well, let's just throw up barriers and protect our own and not compete. That was thesentiment, by the way, that was in place during decent economic times. After all, we gotCAFTA out of the Congress by one vote. And it would be a huge mistake if we become aprotectionist nation. And that might be a good thing for the Bush center to do at SMU, is to remind people aboutthe benefits of free and fair trade -- benefits for our own workers, benefits for workersoverseas, and benefits when it comes to promoting development and helping lift people out ofpoverty, in particularly, third world countries.The best way to enhance economic growth in a third world country and to give people achance to realize a better future is through trade. It's been proven, it's a fact. And I'm hopefulthat the country doesn't slip into protectionist policy. April, yes, ma'am. Question: Thank you, Mr. President. President Bush: Yes. You were sound asleep back there, so I decided --Question: No, I wasn't. There was a whole clear row before me. I thought you were going togo there. But either way, thanks for the surprise. Mr. President, on New Orleans, you basically talked about a moment ago about the photoopportunity. But let's talk about what you could have done to change the situation for the cityof New Orleans to be further along in reconstruction than where it is now. And also, when youcame -- or began to run for the Oval Office about nine years ago or so, the James Byrddragging death was residue on your campaign. And now at this time, 2009, we have the firstblack President. Could you tell us what you have seen on the issues of race, as you see it fromthe Oval Office? President Bush: Sure, thanks. First of all, we did get the $121 billion, more or less, passed,and it's now being spent. Secondly, the school system is improving dramatically. Thirdly,people are beginning to move back into homes. This storm was a devastating storm, April,that required a lot of energy, a lot of focus and a lot of resources to get New Orleans up andrunning. And has the reconstruction been perfect? No. Have things happened fairly quickly? Absolutely.And is there more to be done? You bet there is. Question: What more needs to be done? President Bush: Well, more people need to get in their houses. More people need to havetheir own home there. But the systems are in place to continue the reconstruction of NewOrleans.People said, well, the federal response was slow. Don't tell me the federal response was slowwhen there was 30,000 people pulled off roofs right after the storm passed. I remember goingto see those helicopter drivers, Coast Guard drivers, to thank them for their courageousefforts to rescue people off roofs. Thirty thousand people were pulled off roofs right after thestorm moved through. It's a pretty quick response. Could things have been done better? Absolutely. Absolutely. But when I hear people say, thefederal response was slow, then what are they going to say to those chopper drivers, or the30,000 that got pulled off the roofs? The other part of the -- look, I was affected by the TV after the elections -- when I saw peoplesaying, I never thought I would see the day that a black person would be elected President,and a lot of the people had tears streaming down their cheeks when they said it. And so I am-- I am -- consider myself fortunate to have a front-row seat on what is going to be an historicmoment for the country. President-Elect Obama's election does speak volumes about how farthis country has come when it comes to racial relations. But there's still work to do. There'salways going to be work to do to deal with people's hearts. And so I'm looking forward to it, really am. I think it's going to be -- it's going to be anamazing -- amazing moment. Michael Allen -- yes, Michael Allen. Question: Mr. President -- President Bush: Who would be you. Q Mr. President, often Presidents go -- leave here; they say they're going to decompress, andthen pretty soon they're right back in their office. I wonder how quickly you think you're goingto be back at it, whether it's writing your book, whether it's speaking, whether it's traveling,whether it's -- President Bush: You know, Mike, I don't know. Probably the next day. I'm a Type Apersonality, you know, I just -- I just can't envision myself, you know, the big straw hat andHawaiian shirt sitting on some beach.Question: No one else can, either. President Bush: So -- Particularly since I quit drinking. Anyway, so I predict to you that --first of all, I'm not sure what to expect. For the last eight years I've had a national securitybriefing every day but Sunday. And when you get a national security briefing, it is a reminderof the responsibilities of the job. It's just a daily reminder about what may or may nothappen. The interesting thing about this job, by the way, is it's one thing to deal with the expected,what you anticipate; the real challenge is to be in a position to deal with the unexpected. Andthat's why those intel briefings are so important, because there is -- there's an awareness inthe briefings by the analyst to try to help anticipate problems. And of course you hope theydon't arise, but you better be prepared when they do. And that in itself creates a -- you know, gets your attention, when you start thinking aboutwhat could happen. And the key there, of course, is that -- to take these different analysesseriously, and then have a structure so that your team will be in a position to analyze andthen lay out potential avenues for the President -- from which the President can choose. I say all that because that's -- this has been -- this notion about being briefed and thinkingabout this issue or that issue has been just a part of my life for eight years. People say, well,there you are in Crawford on vacation. You never escape the presidency. It travels with youeverywhere you go. And there's not a moment where you don't think about being President --unless you're riding mountain bikes as hard as you possibly can, trying to forget for themoment. And so I wake up in Crawford Tuesday morning -- I mean, Wednesday morning, and I suspectI'll make Laura coffee and go get it for her. And it's going to be a different feeling. And I can't-- it's kind of like -- I'll report back after I feel it. Last question. Ann -- since you've been there from day one. Question: Thank you -- and I wanted to ask you about day one. You arrived here wanting tobe a uniter, not a divider.Do you think Barack Obama can be a uniter, not a divider? Or is -- with the challenges for anyPresident and the unpopular decisions, is it impossible for any President to be uniter, not adivider? President Bush: I hope the tone is different for him than it has been for me. I amdisappointed by the tone in Washington, D.C. I tried to do my part by not engaging in thename-calling and -- and by the way, needless name-calling. I have worked to be respectful ofmy opponents on different issues. There -- we did find some good common ground on a variety of issues -- No Child Left Behind,Medicare/prescription drugs, PEPFAR, in the end, the funding for troops in Iraq. Tax cuts, to acertain extent, got some bipartisan votes on them. There had been areas where we were ableto work together. It's just the rhetoric got out of control at times -- Question: Why? President Bush: I don't know why. You need to ask those who -- those who used the wordsthey used. As I say, it's not the first time it's ever happened -- as I think I answered that toJim, there. It's happened throughout our history. And I would hope that, frankly, for the sakeof the system itself, that if people disagree with President-Elect Obama, they treat him withrespect. I worry about people looking at our system and saying, why would I want to go upthere and work in that kind of environment? And so I wish him all the best. And no question he'll be -- there will be critics. And thereshould be. We all should welcome criticism on different policy -- it's the great thing about ourdemocracy; people have a chance to express themselves. I just hope the tone is respectful.He deserves it -- and so does the country. It has been a honor to work with you. I meant what I said when I first got up here. I wish youall the very best. I wish you and your families all the best.God bless you.",bush

"Good morning. For the last eight years, I have had the honor of speaking to the Americanpeople Saturday mornings through this radio address. In hundreds of broadcasts, I havetalked to you about important issues affecting our security and our prosperity. And today, inmy final address, I want to send a simple and heartfelt message: Thank you. Eight years ago, Laura and I left our home in Texas to come to Washington. Through twoterms in the White House, we have been blessed by your kind words and generous prayers.We have been inspired by those of you who reach out to feed the hungry, clothe the needy,and care for the sick. We have been moved by the courage and devotion of those of you whowear the uniform. Serving as your President has been an incredible honor.Like every individual who has held this office before me, I have experienced setbacks. Thereare things I would do differently if given the chance. Yet I've always acted with the bestinterests of our country in mind. I have followed my conscience and done what I thought wasright. You may not agree with some tough decisions I have made. But I hope you can agreethat I was willing to make the tough decisions. The decades ahead will bring more hard choices for our country, and there are some guidingprinciples that should shape our course. While our Nation is safer than it was seven years ago,the gravest threat to our people remains another terrorist attack. Our enemies are patient,and determined to strike again. America did nothing to seek or deserve this conflict. But wehave been given solemn responsibilities, and we must meet them. We must resistcomplacency. We must keep our resolve. And we must never let down our guard. At the same time, we must continue to engage the world with confidence and clear purpose.In the face of threats from abroad, it can be tempting to seek comfort by turning inward. Butwe must reject isolationism and its companion, protectionism. Retreating behind our borderswould only invite danger. In the 21st century, security and prosperity at home depend on theexpansion of liberty abroad. If America does not lead the cause of freedom, that cause will notbe led. As we address these challenges -- and others we cannot foresee today -- America mustmaintain our moral clarity. I've often spoken to you about good and evil. This has made someuncomfortable. But good and evil are present in this world, and between the two there can beno compromise. Murdering the innocent to advance an ideology is wrong every time,everywhere. Freeing people from oppression and despair is eternally right. This nation mustcontinue to speak out for justice and truth. We must always be willing to act in their defense -- and to advance the cause of peace. Eight years ago, on a cold January morning, I stood on the steps of the United States Capitol,placed my hand on the Bible, and swore a sacred oath to defend our people and ourConstitution. On that day, I spoke of ""our nation's grand story of courage and its simpledream of dignity."" Next week, my term of service will come to an end -- but that story andthat dream will continue.On Tuesday, Laura and I will join all Americans in offering our best wishes to PresidentObama, his wife Michelle, and their two beautiful girls. And later that day, we will return to thelove of family and friends in Texas. I will depart office proud of my Administration's record.And I will spend the rest of my life grateful for the opportunity to have served as President ofthe greatest nation on Earth. Thank you for listening.",bush
"Thank you, very much. Mr. Secretary, thank you very much. Mr. Vice President, Dr. Biden,President Clinton, Mr. Speaker, members of Congress, my friends Tommy Franks and TomRidge, thank you for helping raise the money for this memorial. Members of the National ParkService and the National Park Foundation, all those who supported this memorial, but mostimportantly, the families of Flight 93.Laura and I are honored to join you in dedicating this memorial to the heroes of Flight 93.When the sun rose in the Pennsylvania sky ten years ago tomorrow, it was a peacefulSeptember morning. By the time it set nearly 3,000 people were gone. The most lives lost onAmerican soil in a single day since the battle of Antietam.With the distance of a decade, 9/11 can feel like a part of a different era. But for the familiesof the men and women stolen, some of whom join us today, that day will never feel likehistory. The memory of that morning is fresh and so is the pain. America shares your grief.We pray for your comfort and we honor your loved ones.September the 11th, 2001, innocent men and women went to work at the World TradeCenter. They reported for duty at the Pentagon. They boarded American Flights 11 and 77,United Flights 93 and 175. They did nothing to provoke or deserve the deliberate act ofmurder that al Qaeda carried out.One of the lessons of 9/11 is that evil is real, and so is courage. When the planes struck theWorld Trade Center, firefighters and police officers charged up the stairs into the flames. Asthe towers neared collapse, they continued the rescue efforts.Ultimately, more than 400 police officers and firefighters gave their lives. Among them wasthe chief of the New York City Fire Department, Peter Gancy. As a colleague put it, he wouldnever ask anyone to do something he didn't do himself.The Pentagon service members and civilians pulled friends and strangers from burning rubble.One special forces soldier recalls reaching through a cloud of smoke in search of the wounded.As he entered one room, he prayed to find someone alive. He discovered a severely burnedwoman and carried her to safety. They later met in the hospital, where she explained thatshe'd been praying for rescue. She called him her guardian angel.And then there's the extraordinary story we commemorate here. Aboard United Airlines Flight93 were college students from California, an iron worker from New Jersey, veterans of theKorean War and World War II, citizens of Germany and Japan, a pilot who had rearranged hisschedule so that he could take his wife on a vacation to celebrate their anniversary.When the passengers and crew realized the plane had been hijacked, they reported the newscalmly. When they learned that the terrorists had crashed other planes into targets on theground, they accepted greater responsibilities. In the back of the cabin, the passengersgathered to devise a strategy.  At the moment America's democracy was under attack, our citizens defied their captors byholding a vote. The choice they made would cost them their lives, and they knew it. Manypassengers called their loved ones to say goodbye; then hung up to perform their final act.One said, ""They're getting ready to break into the cockpit. I have to go. I love you."" Anothersaid, ""It's up to us. I think we can do it.""In one of the most stirring accounts, Todd Beamer, a father of two with a pregnant wife with ahome in New Jersey, asked the air phone operator to join him in reciting the Lord's Prayer.Then he helped lead the charge to the front of the plane with the words ""Let's roll.""With their selfless act, the men and women who stormed the cockpit lived out the words,""Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.""1 And withtheir brave decision, they launched the first counter offensive of the war on terror. The mostlikely target of the hijacked plane was the United States Capitol. We'll never know how manyinnocent people might have been lost, but we do know this: Americans are alive todaybecause the passengers and crew of Flight 93 chose to act, and our nation will be forevergrateful.The 40 souls who perished on the plane left a great deal behind. They left spouses andchildren and grandchildren who miss them dearly. They left successful businesses andpromising careers and a lifetime of dreams that they will never have the chance to fulfill. Theyleft something else: a legacy of bravery and selflessness that will always inspire America.For generations people will study the flight, the story of Flight 93. They will learn thatindividual choices make a difference, that love and sacrifice can triumph over evil and hate,and that what happened above this Pennsylvania field ranks among the most courageous actsin American history.The memorial we dedicate today will ensure our nation always remembers those lost here on9/11. But we have a duty beyond memory. We have a duty beyond honoring. We have a dutyto live our lives in a way that upholds the ideals for which the men and women gave theirlives, to build a living memorial to their courage and sacrifice. We have a duty to find commonpurpose as a nation.In the days after 9/11, the response came like a single hand over a single heart. Members ofCongress from both sides of the aisle gathered on the steps of the capitol and sang ""God blessAmerica."" Neighbors reached out to neighbors of all backgrounds and beliefs.The past decade, our country has been tested by natural disaster, economic turmoil, anxietiesand challenges here at home and abroad. There have been spirited debates along the way.It's the essence of democracy. But Americans have never been defined by our disagreements.Whatever challenges we face today and in the future, we must never lose faith in our ability tomeet them together. We must never allow our differences to harden into divisions.Second, we have a duty to remain engaged in the world. 9/11 proved that the conditions inthe country on the other side of the world can have an impact on our own streets. It may betempting to think it doesn't matter what happens to a villager in Afghanistan or a child inAfrica, but the temptation of isolation is deadly wrong.World repression and anger and resentment will be a never ending source of violence andthreats. A world of dignity and liberty and hope will be safer and better for all. The surest wayto move toward that vision is for the United States of America to lead the cause of freedom.Finally, we each have a duty to serve a cause larger than ourselves. The passengers aboardFlight 93 set an example that inspires us all. Many have followed their path of service bydonating blood or mentoring a child or volunteering in desperate corners of the earth. Somehave devoted their careers to analyzing intelligence or protecting our borders and securing ourskies. Others have made the noble choice to defend our nation in battle.For 10 years, our troops have risked and given their lives to prevent our enemies fromattacking America again. They've kept us safe; they have made us proud; and they haveupheld the spirit of service shown by the passengers on Flight 93.Many years ago in 1863, another President came to dedicate a memorial site in this state. Hetold his audience that:In a larger sense we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow thisground. For the brave souls who struggled there, it consecrated it far above our poorpower to add or detract.He added, ""The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can neverforget what they did here.""So it is with Flight 93.For as long as this memorial stands, we will remember what the men and women aboard theplane did here. We'll pay tribute to the courage they showed, the sacrifice they made, and thelives they spared.The United States will never forget.May God bless you all.",bush
"Thank you all.  As has been mentioned, in 2006 Laura and I came here to Warren EastonCharter High School a year after Katrina hit, and we are honored and pleased to be back inthe 10th anniversary of that devastating storm. I cant think of a better place to come here inNew Orleans, except for some of the restaurants.The slogan that guided the school when we first visited is true today:  We believe in success. And because of that success, that schools like this have achieved, youve given all Americansreason to believe that New Orleans is back and better than ever.Mr. Mayor, thank you for your hospitality.  You and the First Lady have been so gracious tous, and we want to thank you for your leadership.  If enthusiasm and a good strategy counts,New Orleans is going to be -- is in good hands.  And we thank you very much.By the way, I do bring greetings from one of the co-chairmen of the Bush KatrinaFund: [President George H.W. Bush] 41.  He had one of the great lines of all time.  He said,Who would have thought getting out of bed at age 91 would be more dangerous thanjumping out of an airplane at age 90?I want to thank David Garland, President of the Warren Easton Charter Foundation Board.  Iwant to thank all the folks who have shown up.  As Laura said, we had a roundtablediscussion.  Many of our friends were there, people we worked with.  I think of NormanFrancis for example, one of the great leaders of New Orleans, one of the great minds of NewOrleans.In spite of the devastation, we have many fond memories.  I remember sitting with [GeneralRussel L.] Honor on top one of those big ships, strategizing.  I think you were drinking; Iwasnt of course.  But its...great to see you. Surely, were honored that you took time tocome.  Obviously, members of Congress, members of the State House, Superintendent White,on and on, thank you all for coming.I really want to thank the leadership of the school and well talk about them here in a minute.Although I must confess, the Principal is always a teacher.  So she tried to teach me how tosecond line with the band here at Warren Easton.  I -- I know she didnt say it, but she wasthinking, This, this boy needs a lot of work.  So were thrilled with your hospitality.In a cruel twist, Hurricane Katrina brought despair during what should have been a season ofhope -- the start of the new school year.  Students who had recently gone back to schoolsuddenly had no school to go back to.  Many had nowhere to live.  The floodwaters, as you allknow better than most, claimed schools and homes alike.  As Laura mentioned, the stand --the ground were on today was underwater.  All of us who are old enough to remember willnever forget the images of our fellow Americans amid a sea of misery and ruin.  Well alwaysremember the lives lost across the Gulf Coast.  Their memories are in our hearts and I hopeyou pray for their families.Hurricane Katrina is a story of loss beyond measure. Its also a story of commitment andcompassion.I hope you remember what I remember, and that is 30,000 people were saved in theimmediate aftermath of the storm by U.S. military personnel, by Louisiana law enforcement,and by citizens who volunteered.I hope you remember what I remember, and that was the thousands who came here on avolunteer basis to provide food for the hungry and to help find shelter for those who had nohome to live in.  There are people all around our country who prayed for you, many of whomshowed up so they could say they helped a fellow citizen who was hurting.One of the groups that stepped forward to serve were the educators of New Orleans.  At atime when it would have been easy to walk away from the wreckage, the educators heretoday thought of the children who would be left behind.  You understood that bringing NewOrleans back to life requires getting students back to school.  And even though some of theeducators had lost almost everything you owned, you let nothing stand in your way.  Today,we celebrate the resurgence of New Orleans schools. We honor the resilience of a greatAmerican city whose levees gave out but whose people never gave up.Out of the devastation of Katrina, you vowed to do more than just open the schools.  Youvowed to challenge the status quo.  Long before the great flood, too many students in this citydrifted from grade to grade without ever learning the skills needed for success. Parentslacked choices and the power to intervene.  Principals and teachers lacked the authority tochart a more hopeful course.  It was a system that stranded more than 60 percent of thestudents failing in schools.  It was what I called ""the soft bigotry of low expectations.""1The decisions made in the dark hours after Katrina sparked a decade of reform.  Rather thanjust reopen the schools, we organized many into charter schools that are independentlyoperated but publicly accountable for achieving high standards.  More than nine in ten publicschool students in this city now call [a] charter school home.  Administrators at these schoolshave the freedom to slice through red tape and the freedom to innovate.  Parents at theseschools have choices if dissatisfied.  And the results at these schools have beenextraordinary.  The reason we know is because we measure, and any attempt to undermineaccountability in our school system does a huge disservice to the students who go to theschools in New Orleans.According to the new report2 by the Cowen Institute, [the] percentage in New Orleansstudents graduating on time has soared since Katrina. [The] percentage of students whoattended schools that score better than the state average almost doubled, and so has thepercentage of students meeting basic standards. And youve got to ask, Why?  It just didnthappen.  A lot of it [was] structural, and a lot of it requires strong leadership -- people whostared into the eye of the storm and who refused to back down.  And so Laura and I are herein New Orleans to remind our country about what strong leadership means, and were here tosalute the leaders.I think of Jenny Rious here at Warren Easton.  After Katrina, Jenny left New Orleans and wasforced to leave New Orleans. She started a website called Warren Easton in Exile. The sitereunited students scattered across the country around a vision for returning to New Orleansand reopening this school.  When Jenny returned to New Orleans, the first place she went wasnot her house.  It was this school.  And as she put it, I would rather see my own house burndown than this school.  Jenny would give anything for Easton and today, we give teacherslike hers our sincere thanks.[Its] amazing what happened in this city after the storm wiped out the school system. Educational entrepreneurs decided to do something about the devastation and the failure. Ive met a lot of them when I was President, and subsequent to my presidency.  NeeravKingsland is one such person.  He took a leadership role at an organization called NewSchools for New Orleans. He worked with others to help launch dozens of new schools and toturn ideas in -- to reform into reality. In other words, this isn't a theoretical exercise. Itsimportant for our country to look at New Orleans and realize this is an exercise ofimplementing a plan which works.He -- He, so Neerav was so encouraged by what he sees here that he -- hes talking up thereforms to other cities around the country.  Isnt it amazing? The storm that nearly destroysNew Orleans, and yet now New -- New Orleans is the beacon for school reform. Neeravrepresent[s] the virtues that Bill Clinton and I had in mind when we announced the newPresidential Leadership Scholars program, and were honored that Neerav was among the firstclass of scholars.Achieving these results took librarians who salvaged their collections from wateringwreckage.  Listen, I know something about librarians.  I married one.  Im really proud of theLaura Bush Foundation.  Shes talked about the Grants -- talked about Pam and Marshall. These are citizens who supported this Foundation who, if theyd been in New Orleans, theydidnt stay very long. And yet, like many around the country, they care deeply about thefuture of this city.  I hope the students here -- Im really thrilled youre here by the way andthank you for staying awake.  I hope you realize the compassion of others in helping yourealize a good education.It turns out that every good school, a school thats succeeding -- a school that' succeeding --and we know its succeeding, because we measure against other standards -- requires strongprincipals.  And theres no doubt that Lexi Medley is a strong leader.  I love when she says --when she says, If you fail, we fail.  The students our product.  We dont believe in puttingout anything but the best.In order to succeed, in order to lead properly, youve got to set high goals and highexpectations.  And thats what Lexi and this school have done.  As you heard, this school hasgraduated 100 percent of its seniors for the past five years.  Lexi, youve earned ouradmiration and our gratitude, along with our best wishes for a happy birthday tomorrow.Its the stories of schools like this one and others that we see a determination to rebuild betterthan before.  And it -- it's a spirit much stronger than any storm.  Its a spirit thats liftedcommunities laid low by tornadoes or terrorist attacks.  Its a spirit that I saw in New Orleansten years ago, and that is very evident today.We see that spirit in the population that has ticked back up as families settle back down.  Wesee it in the tourists who are drawn here not only by this citys rich heritage but the new hotelrooms and restaurants.  We see it in the spirit in Lauren LeDuff.  As Laura mentioned --Lauren mentioned -- Laura and I first met her in 2006 when she was a senior at Easton. She's happy to be back at the school she loved -- She was happy to be back at the school sheloved at the time.  And you know what she told me?  She said, I want to be a teacher.  Andhere she is as a member of this faculty, teaching English.  I probably needed her when I wasin high school.  When asked how students have overcome adversity, Lauren says, We teachour kids to be resilient.  Thats in the culture of this city.Lauren's right.  The resilience you teach at Warren Easton is the same resilience that this cityshowed the world in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.  On this anniversary, the work of makinga stronger and more hopeful New Orleans goes on.  Youve achieved a lot over the last tenyears.  And with belief in success, and a faith in God, New Orleans will achieve even more. The darkness from a decade ago has lifted.  The Crescent City has risen again.  And its bestdays lie ahead.Thank you for having me.",bush
"Thank you, Senator. I, too, am really pleased that President Obama and Mrs. Obama havecome down to Dallas. I also want to welcome [the] vice president and Mrs. Biden; Mr. Mayor;Chief Brown; elected officials; members of the law enforcement community.Today the nation grieves, but those of us who love Dallas and call it home have had fivedeaths in the family. Laura and I see members of law enforcement every day. We count -- Wecount them as our friends. And we know, like for every other American, that their courage isour protection and shield.Were proud of the men we mourn and the community that has rallied to honor them andsupport the wounded. Our mayor and police chief and our police department have beenmighty inspirations for the rest of the nation.These slain officers were the best among us:- Lorne Ahrens, beloved husband to detective Katrina Ahrens and father of two;- Michael Krol, caring son, brother, uncle, nephew, and friend;- Michael Smith, U.S. Army veteran, devoted husband, and father of two;- Brent Thompson, Marine Corps vet, recently married;- Patrick Zamarippa, U.S. Navy Reserve combat veteran, proud father, and loyal TexasRangers fan.With their deaths, we have lost so much. We are grief stricken, heartbroken, and forevergrateful.Every officer has accepted a calling that sets them apart. Most of us imagine if the momentcalled for, that we would risk our lives to protect a spouse or a child. Those wearing theuniform assume that risk for the safety of strangers. They and their families share theunspoken knowledge that each new day can bring new dangers.But none of us were prepared, or could be prepared, for an ambush by hatred and malice. Theshock of this evil still has not faded.At times it seems like the forces pulling us apart are stronger than the forces binding ustogether. Argument turns too easily into animosity. Disagreement escalates too quickly intode-humanization.Too often we judge other groups by their worst examples, while judging ourselves by our bestintentions. And this has -- And this has strained our bonds of understanding and commonpurpose.But Americans, I think, have a great advantage. To renew our unity, we only need toremember our values. We have never been held together by blood or background. We arebound by things of the spirit, by shared commitments to common ideals.At our best, we practice empathy, imagining ourselves in the lives and circumstances ofothers. This is the bridge across our nations deepest divisions.And it's not merely a matter of tolerance, but of learning from the struggles and stories of ourfellow citizens and finding our better selves in the process.At our best, we honor the image of God we see in one another. We recognize that we arebrothers and sisters, sharing the same brief moment on Earth and owing each other theloyalty of our shared humanity.At our best, we know we have one country, one future, one destiny. We do not want the unityof grief, nor do we want the unity of fear. We want the unity of hope, affection, and highpurpose.We know that the kind of just, humane country we -- we want to build, that we have seen inour best dreams, is made possible when men and women in uniform stand guard. At theirbest, when theyre trained and trusted and accountable, they free us from fear.The Apostle Paul said, For God gave us a spirit not of fear, but of strength and love and self-control.1 Those are the best responses to fear in the life of our country; and theyre the codeof the peace officer.Today, all of us feel a sense of loss -- but not equally. Id like to conclude with the word of thefamilies, the spouses, and especially the children of the fallen: Your loved one[s] time withyou was too short. They did not get a chance to properly say goodbye. But they went whereduty called. They defended us, even to the end. They finished well. We will not forget whatthey did for us.Your loss is unfair. We cannot explain it. We can stand beside you and share your grief. Andwe can pray that God will comfort you with a hope deeper than sorrow and stronger thandeath.May God bless you.",bush
"Laura has been very much engaged in this museum for a long time. She sits on the board.And were honored to be here.My first reaction is I hope all our fellow citizens come and look at this place. It is fabulous.Mr. President and First Lady, Vice President, Chief Justice; David [Skorton], thank you verymuch; the board. I do want to give a shout out to Lonnie [Bunch]. Its really important tounderstand this project would not and could not have happened without his drive, his energy,and his optimism. Now, as Laura mentioned 15 years ago members from both part[ies] -- Congressman JohnLewis and Sam Brownback, then-senator from Kansas -- informed me that they were about tointroduce legislation creating a new museum to share the stories and celebrate theachievements of African Americans.You know, it would be fair to say that the Congress and I did not always see eye to eye -- ifyou know what I mean, Mr. President. But this is one issue where we strongly agreed. I washonored to sign the bill [H.R. 3442] authorizing the construction of this national treasure. AndIm pleased it now stands where it has always belonged, on the National Mall.This museum is an important addition to our country for many reasons. Here are three. First, it shows our commitment to truth. A great nation does not hide its history. It faces itsflaws and corrects them. This museum tells the truth that a country founded on the promiseof liberty held millions in chains, that the price of our union was Americas original sin.From the beginning, some spoke to truth -- John Adams, who called slavery an ""evil ofColossal Magnitude"" -- their voices were not heeded, and often not heard. But they werealways known to a power greater than any on earth, One who loves His children and meantthem to be free. Second, this museum shows Americas capacity to change. For centuries, slavery andsegregation seemed permanent, permanent parts of our national life -- but not to Nat Turneror Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks, or Martin Luther King Jr. All answeredcruelty with courage and hope.In a society governed by the people, no wrong lasts forever. After struggle and sacrifice, theAmerican people, acting through the most democratic of means, amended the constitutionthat originally treated slaves as three-fifths of a person, to guarantee equal protection of thelaws. After a decade of struggle, civil rights acts and voting rights acts were finally enacted.Even today, the journey toward justice is still not complete. But this museum will inspire us togo farther and get there faster.And finally, the museum showcases the talent of some of our finest Americans. The galleriescelebrate not only African American equality, but African American greatness. I -- I can't helpbut note that -- [audience applause]. I cannot help but note that a huge influence in myteenage years is honored here, the great Chuck Berry; or my baseball idol growing up in farWest Texas, the great Willie Mays. And of course, something I never really mastered, theability to give a good speech, but Thurgood Marshall sure could.And some of you may know Im a fledgling painter, a struggling artist. I have a newappreciation for the artists whose brilliant works are displayed here, people like RobertDuncanson, Henry Ossawa Tanner, Charles Henry Alston.Our country is better and more vibrant because of their contributions and the contributions ofmillions of African Americans. No telling of American history is neither complete nor accuratewithout acknowledging them.The lesson of this museum is all -- that all Americans share a past and a future by stayingtrue to our principles, righting injustice, and encouraging the empowerment of all. We will bean even greater nation for generations to come.I congratulate all those who played a role in creating this wonderful museum.May God bless us all.",bush
"Freedom itself was attacked this morning by a faceless coward. And freedom will be defended.I want to reassure the American people that full -- the full resources of the federalgovernment are working to assist local authorities to save lives and to help the victims ofthese attacks.Make no mistake, the United States will hunt down and punish those responsible for thesecowardly acts.I've been in regular contact with the Vice President, Secretary of Defense, the nationalsecurity team, and my cabinet. We have taken all appropriate -- appropriate securityprecautions to protect the American people. Our military at home and around the world is on high alert status. And we have taken thenecessary security precautions to continue the functions of your government. We have been in touch with leaders of Congress and with world leaders to assure them thatwe will do what is -- whatever is necessary to protect America and Americans.I ask the American people to join me in saying a ""thanks"" for all the folks who have beenfighting hard to rescue our fellow citizens, and to join me in saying a prayer for the victimsand their families. The resolve of our great nation is being tested, but make no mistake. We will show the worldthat we will pass this test. God bless.",bush
"Today I am pleased to sign into law H.R. 5528, the Omnibus Indian Advancement Act.This Act is the product of lengthy negotiations among the Congress, my Administration, tribal governments and other interested parties.I commend all of the participants in these negotiations for their work in producing a bill that will benefit many Indian communities.This Act emphasizes my Administration's commitment to self-determination and self-governance of American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian people.In particular, the Act establishes an American Indian Education Foundation to encourage and accept private gifts to help further the education of Indian children attending Bureau of Indian Affairs schools in grades K-12; offers increased economic development opportunities for Indian tribes; authorizes new activities to help support and improve tribal governance, including the new Native Nations Institute at the Morris K.Udall Foundation; provides for the settlement of an historic land case in California; restores and reestablishes the Federal and trust relationship to two separate tribal groups; improves housing assistance to and affordable housing for Native Americans and Native Hawaiians; and includes other benefits and authorities for various American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian communities.Section 1104 of this bill raises a constitutional concern insofar as it could be read to interfere with my constitutional authority to determine when and whether to recommend legislation to the Congress.I will therefore treat it as precatory.This Act demonstrates our commitment to providing more support to the aboriginal peoples of this Nation.I am pleased to sign it into law.",clinton
"Warm greetings to everyone celebrating Christmas.At this joyous season each year, we savor our treasured Christmas traditions: a favorite ornament placed carefully on the tree, candles in the windows, a wreath on the door, family and friends gathered to exchange not only material gifts, but also the gifts of love and laughter.But amidst all these traditions, we remember that the true message of Christmas is in the Child whose birth we celebrate&mdash;the living proof of God's mercy and unending love.Christ's message of renewal and reconciliation is as fresh and powerful today as it was on that first Christmas two thousand years ago.For Americans of many faiths, this is a season of renewal&mdash;of light shining through the darkness, of despair transformed to hope.This year, Christmas is celebrated during the same week as Jews celebrate Hanukkah and Muslims celebrate the Eid Al-Fitr&mdash;a powerful and moving reminder that followers of the three Abrahamic faiths share fundamental values: a reverence for our Creator, a belief in human dignity, and a conviction that we must love our neighbors as ourselves.By building on these shared values, we can create a future where all God's children live together in peace and understanding.As Hillary, Chelsea, and I enjoy our last Christmas in the White House, we extend best wishes to all for a wonderful celebration and for peace and happiness in the years to come.",clinton
"A year ago today I announced the toughest air pollution standards for new cars and sport utility vehicles.Today we take another bold step to clean our air.We are adopting strong new measures to dramatically reduce unhealthy and unsightly emissions from trucks and buses powered by diesel fuel.Together, these actions represent the most sweeping effort ever to protect our air and our health from the pollution caused by the vehicles we drive.They ensure that by the end of the decade, every new car, truck, and SUV in America will be up to 95 percent cleaner than those on the road today.Today's action by the Environmental Protection Agency mandates cleaner diesel fuel and extends the latest pollution control technology to all trucks and buses for the first time.These advances will prevent not only the thick plumes of diesel exhaust all too familiar to motorists but also thousands of cases of respiratory illness and premature deaths.We will spare thousands of children and elderly the agony of asthma and bronchitis and help to fulfill the promise of clean, healthy air for every American.For the past 8 years, Vice President Gore and I have been guided by the conviction that a strong economy and a healthy environment go hand in hand.Indeed, our Nation entered the 21st century enjoying both unprecedented prosperity and the cleanest air and water in a generation.Our actions a year ago and today will help ensure an even safer and more prosperous future for generations yet to come.",clinton
"I am very pleased with the outcome of NATO's foreign ministers meeting in Brussels last week.Secretary Albright and her NATO colleagues reaffirmed the Alliance's commitment to peace, democracy, and respect for human rights throughout southeast Europe.They also reviewed the important progress we have made towards meeting our April 1999 Washington summit commitments&mdash;including improving our defense capabilities, increasing efforts against weapons of mass destruction, and reviewing the enlargement process at our next summit, to take place no later than 2002.I applaud the selection of Prague as the site for the next NATO summit.The Czech Republic under President Havel has been a driving force in the continued integration of Europe.Working closely with the EU, NATO also has advanced the goals we set at the Washington summit for strengthening European defense capabilities.I welcome the agreement at the EU's Nice summit to improve Europe's ability to act in times of crises and to put arrangements in place for close collaboration with NATO.NATO Defense and Foreign Ministers also acted to establish a strategic partnership with the EU.These efforts will strengthen NATO's European pillar, promote the EU's ability to manage crises where NATO is not engaged, and reinforce our transatlantic ties.We still have work to do to implement these arrangements and strengthen the habits of cooperation that have been NATO's hallmark since the end of the cold war.The United States looks forward to working with our European allies and partners to enhance our partnership and advance our common goals.",clinton

"I have withheld my approval of H.R.2415, the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2000.I firmly believe that Americans would benefit from bankruptcy reform legislation that would stem abuse of the bankruptcy system by, and encourage responsibility of, debtors and creditors alike.Unfortunately, this bill is not balanced reform and it omits critical language to require accountability and responsibility from those who unlawfully bar access to legal health services.I hope the next Congress can work in a bipartisan spirit to enact balanced legislation.Over the past several months, my Administration has engaged in a good faith effort to reach agreement with the bill's proponents on a number of outstanding issues.With this goal in mind, we have pursued negotiations notwithstanding my deep concern that the bill failed to address some creditor abuses and also unnecessarily disadvantaged all debtors to stem abuses by a few.An agreement was reached in those negotiations on an essential issue&mdash;limiting homestead exemptions&mdash;with compromises made on both sides.Unfortunately, H.R.2415 fails to incorporate that agreement, instead reverting to a provision that my Administration has repeatedly said was fundamentally flawed and contrary to the central premise of this legislation: that debtors who truly have the capacity to repay a portion of their debts do so.The agreement would have benefited not only those debtors' creditors but also all other debtors through lower credit costs.In contrast, the current bill's unlimited homestead exemptions allow debtors who own lavish homes to shield their mansions from their creditors, while moderate-income debtors, especially those who rent, must live frugally under rigid repayment plans for 5 to 7 years.This loophole for the wealthy is fundamentally unfair and must be closed.And the inclusion of a provision that limits&mdash;to some degree&mdash;a wealthy debtor's capacity to move assets before bankruptcy into a home in a State with an unlimited homestead exemption does not ameliorate the glaring omission of a real homestead cap.Moreover, I have made clear that bankruptcy legislation must require accountability and responsibility from those who unlawfully bar access to legal health services.Far too often, we have seen doctors, health professionals, and their patients victimized by those who espouse and practice violence at health care clinics.The Congress and the States have established remedies for those who suffer as a result of these tactics.However, we are increasingly seeing the use of the bankruptcy system as a strategic tool by those who seek to promote clinic violence while shielding themselves from personal liability and responsibility.It is critical that we shut down this abusive use of our bankruptcy system and prevent endless litigation that threatens the court-ordered remedies owed to victims of clinic violence.The Senate was right in its bipartisan vote of 80-17 to adopt an amendment that would effectively close down any potential for this abuse of the Bankruptcy Code.Nonetheless, this critical provision was dropped from the final bill without public debate, and I fail to understand why the bill's proponents refuse to include this consensus provision to shut down the use of bankruptcy to avoid responsibility for clinic violence.On the positive side, the bill would improve credit card disclosures&mdash;although more can and should be done&mdash;and impose limitations on misleading creditor practices that encourage debtors to reaffirm dischargeable debts on potentially unfavorable terms.However, these beneficial provisions are outweighed by the bill's flaws and omissions.I would have signed a balanced bankruptcy reform bill that addressed known abuses, without tilting the playing field against those debtors who genuinely turn to bankruptcy for a fresh start.I have withheld my approval of H.R.2415 because it does not strike the right balance.",clinton
"Sue, Christy, Carin, Maggie, other family and friends.I was sitting in this service listening to Chuck's family members, friends, partner speak about him, and I was thinking he'd be fairly embarrassed by all these attempts to canonize him.So they put one client on the program.Chuck Ruff became the White House Counsel at an unusual point in history, when the White House was in the hands of the Democratic Party and the Congress was in the hands of a particular wing of the Republican Party, and a lot of the work of the White House Counsel was generated by the attempts of Congress to turn every political difference into a legal issue.And Chuck had to be calm in the face of all of it: Attempts to prove that our policy on climate change, for example, was actually a secret socialist plot to destroy the free enterprise system; serious questions from a person who believed that a good form of criminal investigation was shooting bullets into a watermelon in his backyard.And Chuck never lost his cool, never lost his temper, and never let me entirely lose my sense of humor about what often was a patently absurd situation.And then there were the serious issues beneath all the rancor and back-and-forth.And every single day&mdash;every single day&mdash;I was so profoundly grateful that my Counsel was so strong and wise and good and that he believed so profoundly in our Constitution and rule of law.As others have said, he never sought the spotlight, but when the moment came, he certainly shined.Millions of Americans saw him at work, mind and spirit.He cared about justice.He taught it; he shared it; and he lived it.His whole life was about doing good and doing right.Others have commented on his propensity for doing two things at once.I liked that.He once said that he finally understood that he had been picked as the White House Counsel because he was the only person who was not distracted by my doing crossword puzzles when we reviewed our latest strategy in dealing with the congressional requests.He was famous in the West Wing for watching football and listening to opera at the same time.But really, that captures the best of who he was, a competitor with passion, equal parts grace and guts, someone determined to make the most of every moment.For those of us who knew and loved him, Chuck Ruff may have been in a wheelchair, but he had more moves than Magic Johnson or Michael Jordan, and when he heated up, he could hit any ball further than Tiger Woods, because he was so intensely committed to doing right and doing good.I also would like to say a special word of appreciation, in front of his family and friends, for the fact that, in spite of all of the highprofile things Chuck did as the White House Counsel, one of the things that I most appreciated was that he was always there for the people in the White House, especially for the young people.He was always there with a calming and reassuring word, even in the craziest of times.He could always help people stop and take a breath, listen a little better, think a little harder, gather up their energies, and go on.In a town so often contentious, it was truly amazing to be reminded that you can be civil and effective at the same time.I'd also like to thank him publicly for how much he loved the District of Columbia and how strongly he supported our administration's efforts to be a good neighbor and a good partner.Who can forget that he began his closing statement last year in the well of the Senate: My name is Charles Ruff.I'm from the District of Columbia.And we don't have a vote in the Congress of the United States.I wish, in a way, this platform today in this house of God could be shared by every person in the White House who loved him.And I wish so much that every person out there on the streets of Washington, DC, whom he loved could know just a portion of what he labored to do for them.The reason I was proud to have him as my White House Counsel is that he was not a power lawyer; he was a powerful lawyer for people who had no power.No matter what he was asked to do, he did it with grace and honor, as if that alone was what God put him on Earth to do.And for that I am profoundly grateful.Chuck Ruff left us far too soon.But you can hear in the words and see in the voice of every person who has spoken today that he is still here.I hope he thinks we did all right by him today.I hope he is pleased by this vast assemblage of people, because he certainly always did more than all right by all of us.",clinton
"At the Queluz Summit on May 31, 2000 the U.S.and EU made a commitment to help stem and roll back the spread of HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in Africa, and to address their severe economic, social and personal consequences.The scope of the problem requires a multi-faceted approach and the mobilisation of significant resources.As proof of this commitment, the U.S.and EU have dramatically increased financial resources dedicated to combating these scourges.Together we are now waging the battle against these diseases on all of the major fronts.The U.S.and EU agree that the response to HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria must be placed within a broad multisectoral framework of development aiming at the overall objective of alleviating poverty and to ensure a lasting impact of any specific action to combat HIV/ AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.The U.S.and EU call upon countries to address and incorporate fully the health and development implications of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in the elaboration of their poverty reduction strategies and programs.The U.S.and EU plan to coordinate among the appropriate institutions and organisations at the global and regional level in order to ensure that all aspects of the response are endorsed by relevant stakeholders.The U.S.and EU are working to ensure that governments, institutions and civil society, including NGOs and the private sector, fully participate in these efforts.and EU participate together in donor coordination groups across Africa, assessing local needs and capacities and developing diplomatic and public awareness strategies.U.S.and EU diplomats have successfully encouraged African leaders to speak openly about the threat of HIV/AIDS, to set national priorities, to establish high level governmental coordinating mechanisms, to establish broad health sector and action plans to strengthen regional, national and local capacity to deliver health services and treatment, and to commit resources.We are making great strides in ensuring that our diplomatic activities are responsive to the needs and priorities of host countries, and complement the activities of other donor partners.and EU, other donors and host governments has been established in several African countries.Similar coordination is proposed throughout sub-Saharan Africa.and the EU are working together in planning and implementing country activities that are responsive to the needs and priorities of countries and regions.This assistance is being placed within national and regional health and development frameworks.and the EU are collaborating in sub-Saharan African countries to support health policies and activities aiming at preventing the expansion of the diseases and at caring for and supporting people with HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis and those close to them.and the EU are enhancing their support for national health and other sector plans and policies.This support can take the form of a general support, either direct or through budget, or by supporting specific elements of those plans and policies for combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, for example training, provision of commodities such as condoms and test kits, and improving access to interventions that reduce mother-to-infant HIV transmission.and the EU will work together in close collaboration with national authorities of selected countries to identify mechanisms for the utilisation of debt relief towards comprehensive social programs responding to the challenge of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.and the EU will set up a working group to identify and take advantage of their respective comparative advantages in supporting procurement and the provision of technical assistance.and the EU jointly support multilateral HIV/AIDS initiatives such as UNAIDS and the International Partnership against AIDS in Africa.The U.S.and the EU continue to support the Roll Back Malaria Initiative and the Multilateral Initiative on Malaria, as well as coordinating our assistance to the Stop TB Initiative and the TB Coalition.The U.S.and the EU support new innovative partnerships to increase the availability and affordability of global public goods.and the EU agree that to combat these diseases, the international scientific community needs to work together.Long-term investments in the full range of scientific endeavour are necessary to accelerate the development and evaluation of new and affordable vaccines and drugs.and the EU are enlarging public investment in research and development activities focused on confronting the three communicable diseases, and call upon the private sector to follow this example.and the EU will work together to strengthen the coordination of research projects and to ensure that the coordinated efforts contribute to strengthening sustainable capacities at local, national and regional levels in Africa.The U.S.and the EU will seek to assist in setting up effective infrastructures and will take steps to make key medicines and commodities more affordable and available.African leaders' commitment to improving health systems is essential to the success of these efforts, and we stand ready to provide technical assistance in this regard.and the EU urge the pharmaceutical industry to make drugs for HIV/ AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis more affordable, particularly for the poorest countries.We reaffirm the importance of providing more affordable pricing and strict compliance with safety and quality assurance laws and regulations.",clinton
"The United States and the European Union share a common vision on the question of arms export controls.That is why we have decided to work jointly to encourage all arms exporting countries to adopt the principles and degree of transparency which we apply to our own exports.We are agreed that we have special responsibilities in this respect.Accordingly, together we will pursue the promotion of these principles with rigor and seriousness of purpose.The European Union expressed, very early on, its determination to promote common high-level standards in this field with the adoption in 1991 and 1992 by the Luxembourg and Lisbon European Councils of the first set of common criteria for arms exports.The adoption in 1998 of the EU Code of Conduct for arms exports was a new step forward as it introduced a mechanism for notifications and consultations, the only one of its kind.Since its entry into force in June 1998, the Code of Conduct has helped to increase significantly the level of transparency in arms exports and to promote convergence of the national arms export policies implemented by Member States.The European Union encourages other countries to adhere to the principles of the code of conduct and welcomes the fact that 17 countries have declared they would apply these principles to their own export decisions.The United States, for its part, maintains comprehensive national arms export control policies, including registration of manufacturers and exporters of defense articles and services subject to U.S.jurisdiction, wide-ranging controls on exports of defense services, manufacturing licenses, technical assistance and brokering transactions, rigorous case-by-case review of applications or other requests for approval, requirements for U.S.government consent for retransfers of U.S.origin defense articles and services, and effective enforcement measures including a vigorous program of pre- and post-shipment monitoring of U.S.arms transfers.The United States has also supported efforts to strengthen international and multilateral controls involving greater responsibility, transparency and restraint.The United States has welcomed and expressed its strong support for the principles embodied in the EU Code of Conduct for Arms Exports, which are consistent with the U.S.arms transfer policy criteria.In furtherance of these policies and efforts, the United States has recently proposed the development and negotiation of an international arms sales code of conduct as a means of promoting principles and practices of responsibility, transparency and restraint on a wider international scale.The efficiency of such controls is enhanced by a close dialogue between the licensing authorities and the exporting companies.We reaffirm the fundamental importance we attach to the promotion of democracy and the respect for human rights.For this reason, we deem it crucial to avoid export of military equipment when there is reason to believe that it will be used for internal repression or violation of internationally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms.We also stress that arms transfers should not contribute to or result in excessive or destabilizing arms accumulations, regional instability, armed aggression, the precipitation, escalation or aggravation of internal or interstate conflicts, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and missiles capable of delivering them, international terrorism, or in arms diversion.We reiterate the fundamental importance of respect, by all countries, of international commitments, in particular arms embargoes imposed by the United Nations Security Council and other competent international bodies.Illicit trafficking and diversion of military equipment are also serious concerns.We will continue to exercise particular vigilance with regard to exports of small arms and light weapons.We adopted a joint declaration on Common Principles on Small Arms and Light Weapons, on December 17, 1999, which encompasses these standards.We support the Moratorium and the Code of Conduct adopted by ECOWAS in 1999 and assert our intention to respect the Moratorium's principles when examining export applications at the national level.In this context, the United States and the European Union have decided to act jointly to encourage all arms exporting countries to submit their export decisions to rigorous criteria and to greater transparency.",clinton
"Today I am signing into law H.R.4942, the Departments of Commerce, Justice, State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2001.I commend the Congress for approving a bill that provides critical funding for enforcing our Nation's laws, protecting our precious natural resources, promoting international peace, and supporting our diplomatic operations.Many portions of the Act are considerably improved compared to the previous House and Senate versions.I appreciate and commend the Congress for the many changes that have been made, including providing additional funding to finance the Lands Legacy program; to improve the health of our Nation's ocean fisheries; to help close the digital divide between our more and less affluent citizens; to improve trade compliance; to prosecute local firearms violations; to toughen our Nation's stance against cybercrime and terrorism; to provide additional law enforcement assistance to Native Americans; to fund peacekeeping requirements; and to improve worldwide embassy security.I applaud the Congress for providing over $430 million for the Department of Commerce's components of the Lands Legacy Initiative.This funding will help protect marine sanctuaries; support the new Northwestern Hawaiian Coral Reef Reserve and restore other coral reefs; expand estuarine research reserves; and promote recovery of Pacific coastal salmon runs through grants to western States and Tribes.The Act fully funds activities for the Pacific Salmon Agreement with Canada at $60 million and for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) work on Columbia River Basin salmon populations.Acceptable funding is also provided for a new climate observation initiative, a new education program with Minority Serving Institutions, and two smaller programs: Global Observations to Benefit the Environment and the Global Disaster Information Network.The Act takes an important step toward closing the digital divide by providing the requested tripling of funding for the Technology Opportunities Program.This program will provide grants to promote innovative applications of information technology in under-served communities.I am pleased that over $1.0 billion is provided for the COPS II/21st Century Policing initiative, the successor to the highly effective Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program, which will enable local police departments to begin a five-year plan to hire up to 50,000 additional community police officers, hire new community prosecutors, and expand communitybased prevention efforts.While the appropriated funding level is still below my original request, it is $444 million above the FY 2000 level, and will enable the COPS II program to fund almost 6,000 new officers in FY 2001.The Act provides almost $100 million for the Department of Justice's counterterrorism and cybercrime initiatives.This funding level will allow for improved efforts to meet the growing challenges of terrorism and cybercrime, including State and local first-responder training, staff support for the Joint Terrorism Task Forces and enhanced technology and intelligence-gathering along the northern border.The Department of Justice's components of the Gun Enforcement Initiative are funded at $103 million.This appropriation will support over 600 Federal, State and local gun prosecutors, and increase research on smart gun technologies.The Indian Country Law Enforcement initiative is funded at $111 million.This funding, which is $19 million above the FY 2000 level, will allow the Department of Justice to assist tribes in hiring and equipping law enforcement personnel, constructing detention and court facilities, and developing alternative sentencing programs for alcohol and substance abusers.I am pleased that the Act provides $4.7 billion for the regular operations of the Department of State, including diplomatic and consular programs; information technology investments; and, building leases, maintenance and repair.These funds will pay for support costs critical to maintaining the Department's network of overseas posts and the conduct of foreign affairs worldwide.The funded increases include expanded efforts to promote trade compliance and enhance labor and environmental monitoring.Funding for embassy security and construction also includes requested support for projects of the Agency for International Development.The Act also provides full funding for the Administration's pilot program to allow unclassified communication and sharing of information for all U.S.Government agencies operating at an overseas post, as recommended by the Overseas Presence Advisory Panel.The Act also provides $846 million for Contributions to International Peacekeeping Activities.Funding at this level will allow the United States to continue to support vital UN peacekeeping operations, including ongoing missions in Kosovo, East Timor, Ethiopia/Eritrea and Sierra Leone.I am also pleased that the Act provides $17 million for the Departments of Commerce and State and the United States Trade Representative to help ensure U.S.companies and workers receive the full benefits from the WTO and other bilateral agreements signed by the United States.This funding will help to put experts overseas to deal with compliance issues that continue to hinder fair access to markets, double staff focused on China and Japan, and strengthen antidumping/countervailing duty investigation capabilities.I am pleased that H.R.4577, the Consolidated Appropriations bill, modifies immigration provisions included in this Act, and that the modified legislation will ease immigration restrictions on an estimated 700,000 immigrant families living in the United States.The provisions will extend section 245(i) until April 30, 2001, as opposed to January 14, 1998, under current law, to allow aliens (and their spouses and children) who apply for an adjustment of status or a labor certification to remain in the United States until such petition is approved.Additionally, the provisions will create a new, temporary non-immigrant visa for spouses and children of spouses of legal permanent residents and U.S.citizens seeking to enter the United States to await approval of legal permanent resident status for themselves (the V visa).The provisions will also allow certain individuals who were not granted amnesty under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 who are currently seeking such relief through the courts to apply for permanent residency.While I am disappointed that the legislation fails to eliminate the disparate treatment under our immigration laws sought for Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Hondurans, Haitians, and Liberians and does not provide any relief for deserving individuals affected by changes in the 1996 immigration law, it is the best compromise that could be reached after several rounds of intense negotiations.I am also pleased that the Consolidated Appropriations bill, once signed, will eliminate an objectionable provision in the Commerce/Justice/State Act that purports to protect citizens from the unauthorized sale or display of social security numbers but would not, in fact, provide privacy safeguards that are adequate.Although the funding levels in this Act are acceptable, I am troubled that several issues could not be resolved despite my Administration's best efforts during the final negotiations on the Act.Notably, the Act does not include new hate crimes protections, and fails to extend the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund.I strongly urge the next Congress to reconsider these actions in future legislation.In addition, this bill greatly restricts lowpower FM radio broadcast.Low power radio stations are an important tool in fostering diversity on the airwaves through community-based programming.I am deeply disappointed that Congress chose to restrict the voice of our nation's churches, schools, civic organizations and community groups.I commend the FCC for giving a voice to the voiceless and I urge the Commission to go forward in licensing as many stations as possible consistent with the limitations imposed by Congress.I also oppose language in the Act related to the Kyoto Protocol.The language is inappropriate because the Administration has no intent of implementing the Protocol prior to congressional ratification.The Act includes an additional number of provisions regarding the conduct of foreign affairs that raise serious constitutional concerns.My Administration's objections to these and other language provisions have been made clear in previous statements of Administration policy.I direct the agencies to construe these provisions to be consistent with the President's constitutional prerogatives and responsibilities and where such a construction is not possible, to treat them as not interfering with those prerogatives and responsibilities.Finally, section 629 of the Act amends the Interstate Horseracing Act of 1978 to include within the definition of the term interstate offtrack wager, pari-mutuel wagers on horseraces that are placed or transmitted from individuals in one State via the telephone or other electronic media and accepted by an off-track betting system in the same or another State.The Department of Justice, however, does not view this provision as codifying the legality of common pool wagering and interstate account wagering even where such wagering is legal in the various States involved for horseracing, nor does the Department view the provision as repealing or amending existing criminal statutes that may be applicable to such activity, in particular, sections 1084, 1952, and 1955 of Title 18, United States Code.Several essential modifications to this bill are contained in H.R.4577, the Consolidated Appropriations bill.I am signing H.R.4942 into law today because I believe the Act, as modified by H.R.4577, will meet the overall needs and priorities of the American people.I urge the next Congress and my successor to continue to promote the needs of the American citizenry by pursuing resolution to the troublesome issues I have highlighted above.",clinton
"Thank you.Well, first, I want to thank Janlori Goldman for her wonderful remarks and for her ongoing work in the area of health privacy.I thank the representatives of the doctors, nurses, consumers, and privacy community who are here today and who add input into this effort.I would like to thank my great friend Senator Pat Leahy for being here and for his strong support of privacy issues in the United States Congress.As others have said, I want to thank the entire team of people who worked on this.They worked on this issue for months and months and months.They worked hard.Some of them worked, I might add, at great personal sacrifice to themselves, because of developments unrelated to this issue, to get this out, because they believe so strongly in what they were doing.And I also would like to thank my Chief of Staff, John Podesta, who has been a fanatic on this issue in the best sense.And she said you were beginning to feel like Nebraska.You know, they say that because of the 24hour news cycle, we're all in a permanent campaign.I might say, just parenthetically, I had a wonderful time in Kearney, Nebraska, and in Omaha, and you would be amazed at all the letters I've gotten.I have already received more letters than I thought there were Democrats in the State of Nebraska.So I'm grateful.I want to thank all of you, and especially Donna Shalala, for these last 8 years.I believe that Donna Shalala is a superb leader, a great administrator, always full of energy.You will be happy to know, and not surprised, that she has steadfastly defended the people who work at the Department of Health and Human Services in pitched battles at the White House over various issues.You guys have so much responsibility over so many things; every day you get a new chance to wreck an administration.And she makes it fun, you know? Now she's going to become president of the University of Miami.We're just sort of a way station on her move south.She was at Wisconsin and then here and then going to Miami.Look, we're having a good time today, but I want to take a moment to be very, very serious.We say that we are a free nation in a world growing increasingly free.And in so many ways, that is literally true.During the period in which I was President, I was fortunate enough to serve here at a time when, for the first time in all of human history, more than half the people on the globe live under governments of their own choosing.Now, that's a wonderful thing.That's one manifestation of freedom.Then, there's free speech, the freedom of the press, the right to travel, and also, I might add, minority rights of all kinds, restrictions on the ability of government to compromise the fundamental interests and rights of those who may not agree with the majority.But we must never forget, in this age of increasing interdependence, fueled by an explosion in information technology that is completely changing the way we work and live and relate to each other, that increasingly, we will have to ask ourselves: Does our freedom include privacy? Because there are new and different ways for that privacy to be restricted.In 1928 Justice Brandeis wrote his famous words saying that privacy was the right most valued by civilized people, and he defined it simply as the right to be left alone.Nothing is more private than someone's medical or psychiatric records.And therefore, if we are to make freedom fully meaningful in the information age, when most of our stuff is on some computer somewhere, we have to protect the privacy of individual health records.The new rules we release today protect the medical records of virtually every American.They represent the most sweeping privacy protections ever written, and they are built on the foundation of the bipartisan Kennedy-Kassebaum legislation I signed 4 years ago.This action is required by the great tides of technological and economic change that have swept through the medical profession over the last few years.In the past, medical records were kept on paper by doctors and stored in file cabinets by nurses; doctors and nurses, by and large, known to their patients.Seldom were those records shared with anyone outside the doctor's office.Today, physicians increasingly store them electronically, and they are now obliged to share those records in paper or electronic form with insurance companies and other reviewers.To be sure, storing and transmitting medical records electronically is a remarkable application of information technology.They're cost-effective; they can save lives by helping doctors to make quicker and better-informed decisions.But it is quite a problem that, with a click of a mouse, your personal health information can be accessed without your consent by people you don't know, who aren't physicians, for reasons that have nothing to do with your health care.It doesn't take a doctor to understand that that is a prescription for abuse.So, the rules that we release today have been carefully crafted for this new era, to make medical records easier to see for those who should see them and much harder to see for those who shouldn't.Employers, for instance, shouldn't see medical records, except for limited reasons, such as to process insurance claims.Yet, too often they do, as you just heard.A recent survey showed that more than a third of all Fortune 500 companies check medical records before they hire or promote.One large employer in Pennsylvania had no trouble obtaining detailed information on the prescription drugs taken by its workers, easily discovering that one employee was HIV positive.That is wrong.Under the rules we released today, it will now be illegal.There's something else that's really bothered me too, for years, and that is that private companies should not be able to get hold of the most sensitive medical information for marketing purposes.Yet, too often, that happens as well.Recently, expectant mothers who haven't even told their friends the good news are finding sales letters for baby products in their mailboxes.That's also wrong.And under these new rules, it will also be illegal.Health insurance companies should not be able to share medical records with mortgage companies who might be able to use them to deny you a loan.That actually happens today, but under these rules, it will be illegal.Health insurance companies shouldn't be able to keep you from seeing your own medical records.Up to now, they could.Under these rules, they won't be able to do that anymore.Under the rules being issued today, health plans and providers will have to tell you up front who will and won't be allowed to see your records.And under an Executive order I am issuing today, the Federal Government will no longer have free rein to launch criminal prosecutions based on information gleaned from routine audits of medical records.With these actions today, I have done everything I can to protect the sanctity of individual medical records.But there are further protections our families need that only Congress can provide.For example, only new legislation from Congress can make these new protections fully enforceable and cover every entity which holds medical records.So I urge the new Congress to quickly act to provide these additional protections.For 8 years now, I have worked to marry our enduring values to the stunning possibilities of the information age.In many ways, these new medical privacy rules exemplify what we have tried to do in this administration and how we have tried to do it.We can best meet the future if we take advantage of all these marvelous possibilities but we don't permit them to overwhelm our most fundamental values.I hope that these privacy rules achieve that goal.And again, let me say, for this and so much more, I am profoundly grateful to the people who work here at HHS, the people who work with them at OMB and in the White House.In this action, you have done an enormous amount to reassure and improve the lives of your fellow Americans.Thank you very much.",clinton
"For several years, we have been working with our east Asian allies to improve relations with North Korea in a way that strengthens peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.We have made substantial progress, including the 1994 Agreed Framework, which froze North Korea's production of plutonium for nuclear weapons under ongoing international inspections, and the 1999 moratorium on long-range missile tests.I believe new opportunities are opening for progress toward greater stability and peace on the Korean Peninsula.However, I have determined that there is not enough time while I am President to prepare the way for an agreement with North Korea that advances our national interest and provides the basis for a trip by me to Pyongyang.Let me emphasize that I believe this process of engagement with North Korea, in coordination with South Korea and Japan, holds great promise and that the United States should continue to build on the progress we have made.Our policy toward North Korea has been based on a strong framework developed at my request by former Secretary of Defense William Perry and carried out by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Special Adviser Wendy Sherman.We have coordinated each step forward with our allies the Republic of Korea and Japan.The engagement policy of President Kim Dae-jung and his personal leadership have spurred this process and earned the world's admiration.Taken together, our efforts have reduced tensions on the Korean Peninsula, improved prospects for enduring peace and stability in the region, and opened an opportunity to substantially reduce, if not eliminate, the threat posed by North Korean missile development and exports.This past October, when DPRK Chairman Kim Chong-il invited me to visit his country, and later when Secretary Albright traveled to Pyongyang, Chairman Kim put forward a serious proposal concerning his missile program.Since then, we have discussed with North Korea proposals to eliminate its missile export program as well as to halt further missile development.While there is insufficient time for me to complete the work at hand, there is sufficient promise to continue this effort.The United States has a clear national interest in seeing it through.",clinton
I welcome today's release of Edmond Pope after 8 months of detention in Russia and appreciate President Putin's decision to pardon Mr.Pope.Mr.Pope's ordeal was unjustified.It is fortunate that humanitarian considerations prevailed in the end.I admire the impressive support Mr.Pope received from his wife and family and from Congressman John Peterson of Pennsylvania and other Members of Congress.I commend their tireless efforts on his behalf.,clinton
"The growing reach of international crime poses threats to American citizens and American interests, both at home and abroad.Illegal activity from terrorism to trafficking in arms, drugs, or humans violates our values and threatens our safety.Intellectual property theft, financial fraud, and corruption also can endanger our prosperity and undercut public confidence in democracy and free markets around the world.To confront these challenges, today I am pleased to announce several important initiatives in our ongoing efforts to combat international crime.First, we are releasing a comprehensive International Crime Threat Assessment, prepared at my direction, as part of our International Crime Control Strategy adopted in May, 1998.The new assessment highlights the global dimensions of international crime and the ways this pervasive problem threatens U.S.interests.This broader understanding is necessary if we, together with our international partners, are to strengthen our response to this global problem.Second, earlier this week in Palermo, Italy, the United States joined many other countries in signing the United Nations Convention on Transnational Organized Crime, along with two supplementary protocols on migrant smuggling and trafficking in persons.By harmonizing criminal laws and promoting increased cooperation, the new convention and its protocols will enable the international community to better combat international organized crime.Third, the Departments of State and Justice are establishing a Migrant Smuggling and Trafficking in Persons Coordination Center.The Center will integrate and improve our efforts to counter these distinct but related global crime problems.The Center also will promote and assist increased efforts by foreign governments and international organizations to combat these problems.The United States is strongly committed to strengthening our international crime control programs to achieve a world of greater safety, prosperity, and justice.We urge the international community to join us in enhancing our common efforts to advance these common aims.",clinton
"Today I am pleased to sign into law S.2943, the Assistance for International Malaria Control Act.In doing so, however, I note that section 405(b) of the Act purports to restrict the President's constitutional authority to appoint Officers of the United States by requiring that individuals be appointed to the Pacific Charter Commission only after consultation with specified members of the Congress and by requiring that not more than four of the appointees may be affiliated with the same political party.Because the work of the Commission may interfere with the constitutional authority vested in the President to conduct foreign affairs, the restrictions in section 405(b) are constitutionally problematic and I therefore construe these restrictions to be precatory only.",clinton
"Thank you, Senator.Trying to get in practice, guys.I want to thank Victor and Katy and Barry and all the Special Olympics global messengers.Let's give them all a big hand again.I understand that the very first time you played golf, you hit a ball 250 yards.And I want to know the secret before we go any further with this friendship of ours.I also want to thank our friend Jamie Lee Curtis, who has been a great master of ceremonies and has walked us all through this tonight.Hillary and I have been proud supporters of Special Olympics for many, many years, and we're proud to be part of this very special evening.Special Olympics is a program of sports, training, and competition, but ultimately it's a strong statement of optimism about human life.It says that every human being can learn and grow and contribute to the society we all share.It casts a spotlight on the dignity of human life and the beauty of the human soul.Special Olympics teaches us that when people with disabilities gain skill and confidence, we all win from their abilities.When Special Olympic athletes from America meet their counterparts from places like China and Botswana, people all over the world are enriched.And in this century, we have just begun.If we help Special Olympics establish global networks for families, create new health programs for athletes, and open new opportunity for 2 million athletes around the world, every one of us will be better off.Special Olympics began as a small flicker in the heart of one remarkable woman, Eunice Kennedy Shriver.We miss her tonight, and we thank Sarge and her whole family for being here.Special Olympics enters a new century, not a small flicker but a bursting flame of pride and a beacon of inspiration for every one of us.So tonight we celebrate what has been accomplished, and even more, we look forward to the future with determination and confidence.And now, I want all of our artists to get a big hand.I want one more song.Merry Christmas, everybody.",clinton
"Last night President-elect Bush and Vice President Gore showed what is best about America.In this election, the American people were closely divided.The outcome was decided by a Supreme Court that was closely divided.But the essential unity of our Nation was reflected in the words and values of those who fought this great contest.I was proud of both men.I pledged to President-elect Bush my efforts and the best efforts of every member of our administration for a smooth and successful transition.I want to say I am profoundly grateful to Vice President Gore for 8 extraordinary years of partnership.Without his leadership, we could not have made the progress or reached the prosperity we now enjoy and pass on to the next administration.I am also profoundly grateful to him for putting into words last night the feelings of all of us who disagreed with the Supreme Court's decision, but accepted it.And as he said, all of us have a responsibility to support Presidentelect Bush and to unite our country in the search for common ground.I wish President-elect Bush well.Like him, I came to Washington as a Governor, eager to work with both Republicans and Democrats.And when we reached across party lines to forge a vital center, America was stronger at home and abroad.The American people, however divided they were in this election, overwhelmingly want us to build on that vital center without rancor or personal attack.I thank the Members of Congress from both parties who have pledged to work with the President-elect.They have also pledged to elect commonsense bipartisan election reforms so that the votes of all citizens can be easily cast and easily counted in future elections.Finally, I want to thank the American people for their patience, passion, and patriotism throughout this extended election season.In the days of service left to me, I will do all I can to finish our remaining work with Congress and to help President-elect Bush get off to a good start.As I've said so many times over the last year, our country has never before enjoyed so much peace and prosperity with so few internal crises and so little external threat.We have the opportunity to build the future of our dreams for our children, and every one of us has an obligation to work together to achieve it.Thank you very much.But for right now, we're in a period where we've had an election, but we haven't had the Inauguration.We have to ensure a smooth and constructive transition, and all of us should ensure that we do our part to give the President-elect his chance to do this job.And I would hope&mdash; and I believe that my fellow Democrats would be willing to do that, and I hope they will.I hope they will set a good example by getting off to a good start and trying to unite the country.Two years from now, what I hope will happen is that the honest differences that remain between the two parties will be the subject of a wholesome, vigorous, constructive debate, but that we will be moving further and further away from rancor.That, I think, is actually good for our party, because I think people do agree with us on the issues&mdash;on so many of the vital issues of the day.But I don't think that now is the time to do anything other than follow Vice President Gore's lead.He spoke for all of us last night, and he did it eloquently and well.And President-elect Bush responded with generosity in kind, I thought, in his remarks.And I think we ought to use this opportunity to let the country come together and try to get the new administration off to a good start.Thank you.I think he will, yes.Thank you.",clinton
"Good morning.This week, as I work to conclude the last budget negotiations of my Presidency, I'm reminded how far we've come these past 8 years.We now live in a time of unprecedented peace and prosperity.But we didn't get there by accident.We made tough choices based on core values of opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and a community of all Americans.Today I want to talk about two elements critical to our continued success: first, our progress in moving people from welfare to work; and second, our continuing commitment to fiscal discipline and a budget that puts our people first.Vice President Gore and I took office in 1993 with a pledge to end welfare as we know it.Thanks to comprehensive welfare reform, a renewed sense of responsibility, and the strongest economy in a generation, millions of former welfare recipients now know the dignity of work.Today I am pleased to announce that over the past 8 years we've cut welfare caseloads by more than 8 million people.Last year alone 1.2 million parents on welfare went to work, determined to build better lives.Nationwide over the last 8 years, welfare rolls have dropped nearly 60 percent and now are the lowest in more than 30 years.We've been able to sustain this progress year after year because Government, the private sector, and welfare recipients themselves all have done their parts.Together, we are finally breaking the cycle of dependence that has long crippled the hopes of too many families.When we enacted landmark welfare reform in 1996, I insisted that Congress provide incentives to reward States for helping people to find jobs and to keep jobs.Today I'm pleased to announce that 28 States will receive a total of $200 million in bonuses for doing just that.These grants will enable States to help even more parents go to work and succeed on the job.I urge States to use these resources to provide the necessary support&mdash;from child care to transportation to training&mdash;that can make a critical difference between welfare checks and paychecks.We've also worked hard to help families leaving welfare meet the challenge of affordable health care.In the bipartisan budget package I will soon sign, we will extend Medicaid coverage so that thousands of parents who leave welfare can keep the health coverage protecting them and their children.This budget also includes funding to help cover more uninsured children, speed coverage for patients with Lou Gehrig's disease, and increase payments to hospitals, teaching facilities, home health agencies, and nursing homes in order to ensure quality health care.We have also secured an extra $817 million to help working families afford child care, to meet their responsibilities both at work and at home.These and other child care resources will serve over 2.2 million children next year.In this budget, we're also passing our historic new markets and community renewal initiative, the most significant effort ever to help hardpressed communities lift themselves up through private investment and entrepreneurship.With the help of our new-markets tax credit, 40 strengthened empowerment zones, and 40 renewal communities, this initiative will spur billions and billions of dollars in private investment to communities that have not yet shared in our Nation's great economic revival.From the streets of our central cities to the hills of Appalachia to the rugged vistas of our Native American reservations to the Mississippi Delta, we are giving people the tools of opportunity to make the most of their potential.Finally, this budget also includes vital investments in our children and their education.With over $900 million dedicated for the very first time to school renovation, thousands of local school districts finally will be able to give our children the classrooms they deserve.We've increased funding by 25 percent to stay on track to hire 100,000 highly qualified new teachers to reduce class size in the early grades.We have nearly doubled funding for after-school programs to help more than 1.3 million students, while increasing support for teacher training and for turning around failing schools.And to open the doors of college even wider so that more of our young people can walk through them, we've increased the maximum Pell grant to an all-time high of $3,750.That's up nearly $1,500 since 1993.If we continue to invest in our people and create opportunities for them, if we continue to honor and reward work, our possibilities are truly without limit.By reaching out and working together, our best days still lie ahead.This budget proves it.The work of the American people prove it.The successful desire of people to move from welfare to work proves it.Thanks for listening.",clinton
"Good morning.This weekend we not only celebrate the first Christmas of the new millennium; we also celebrate an America blessed with the gift of unprecedented prosperity and progress.We're in the midst of the longest economic expansion in our Nation's history, with record surpluses, more than 22 million new jobs, the lowest unemployment in history, and the lowest Hispanic- and African-American unemployment ever recorded.We have strengthened the cornerstone of the American dream along the way: the chance to own a home.Today, we have the highest homeownership in our Nation's history with record levels of minority homeownership.And more Americans than ever are celebrating that gift this holiday season.Over the last 8 years, Vice President Gore and I have worked hard to give nearly 10 million more families the opportunity to own their own homes by cutting redtape, speeding up loans, making financing available for families who were too often locked out of the market, creating more opportunity and choice for families who live in assisted housing.In the last 3 years, our administration has secured nearly 200,000 new housing vouchers to help hard-pressed families find decent and affordable housing.I want to especially thank our HUD Secretary, Andrew Cuomo, for his extraordinary commitment to making affordable housing accessible to citizens who need it most.Today we're introducing new measures to more fully integrate public housing, so families from different social and economic walks of life have the chance to live in diverse communities.In addition to expanding opportunity for more Americans, this will also help to break down destructive barriers of race and class.We're also taking action to increase loan limits from the Federal Housing Administration by nearly 9 percent to help more working families to own their first home.Since 1993, the FHA program has given more than 4 million Americans that chance.We have made real progress.But too many Americans still will be spending this Christmas without a roof over their heads.That's why we've helped to move thousands of families off the street.Yet, there still are more than a half million men, women, and children whose only home every night is a neighborhood shelter or a park bench.In this time of unparalleled prosperity, we must do more to help them.Today I'm pleased to announce $1 billion in new grants to help more than 200,000 homeless people along the path to self-sufficiency.This is the largest amount ever dedicated to helping homeless Americans rebuild their lives.The grants will fund proven successful programs like Continuum of Care, which helps homeless families with transitional and permanent housing, drug treatment and medication, job training, and child care.It also funds efforts like the Emergency Shelter Grants program, which provides for transitional housing and helps communities maintain emergency shelters.Taken together, these grants are a gift that will give back to us in many ways.They will empower communities to employ innovative solutions to helping homeless adults and their children, people like Juanita Price, a recovering drug addict who once spent her nights in abandoned buildings and hollowed-out cars.Thanks to the Continuum of Care program, Juanita found the support she needed and turned her life around.Today, she's got a steady job, an apartment, and she's studying to be a nurse at Howard University here in Washington, DC.There are lots and lots of people like Juanita who could use a helping hand.Today we're lending that hand by giving more homeless Americans the tools they need to succeed, so that this Christmas they can find warmth inside a home, not from the top of a steam grate.It is said in the Scripture: I will appoint a place for my people so they may dwell in a place of their own and move no more.Today, in this season of hope and giving, we should redouble our efforts to ensure that every American can have a place of his or her own.The steps we're taking now will create new opportunity for the homeless, for hard-pressed working families, and for those struggling to buy their first home.I can't think of any better way to celebrate this holiday season.Thanks for listening.",clinton
"Governor Richards, Chairman Brown, Mayor Dinkins, our great host, my fellow delegates and my fellow Americans, I am so proud of Al Gore.He said he came here tonight because he always wanted to do the warm-up for Elvis.Well, I ran for President this year for one reason and one reason only: I wanted to come back to this convention and finish that speech I started four years ago.Last night Mario Cuomo taught us how a real nominating speech should be given.He also made it clear why we have to steer our ship of state on a new course.The Cold War is over.Soviet communism has collapsed and our values -- freedom, democracy, individual rights, free enterprise- they have triumphed all around the world.Its time for a change in America.Tonight 10 million of our fellow Americans are out of work, tens of millions more work harder for lower pay.The incumbent President says that unemployment always goes up a little before a recovery begins, but unemployment only has to go up by one more person before a real recovery can begin.And Mr.My mother taught me.She taught me about family and hard work and sacrifice.Thank you, Mother.I love you.When I think about opportunity for all Americans, I think about my grandfather.He ran a country store in our little town of Hope.There was no food stamps back then, so when his customers, whether they were White or Black who worked hard and did the best they could, came in with no money, well, he gave them food anyway.He just made a note of it.So did I.Before I was big enough to see over the counter, I learned from him to look up to people other folks looked down on.My grandfather just had a high school education- a grade school education- but in that country store he taught me more about equality in the eyes of the Lord than all my professors at Georgetown, more about the intrinsic worth of every individual that all the philosophers at Oxford, more about the need for equal justice under the law than all the jurists at Yale Law School.If you want to know where I come by the passionate commitment I have to bringing people together without regard to race, it all started with my grandfather.I learned a lot from another person too: a person who for more than 20 years has worked hard to help our children, paying the price of time to make sure our schools don't fail them.I love you.Frankly, I am fed up with politicians in Washington lecturing the rest of us about family values.Our families have values.But our government doesn't.I want an America where family values live in our actions, not just in our speeches.An America that includes every family.Every traditional family and every extended family.Every two parent family.Every single-parent family.And every foster family.Every family.I do want to say something to the fathers in this country who have chosen to abandon their children by neglecting their child support: Take responsibility for your children or we will force you to do so.Because governments don't raise children; parents do.And you should.And I want to say something to every child in America tonight who is out there trying to grow up without a father or a mother: I know how you feel.And don't you ever let anybody tell you can't become whatever you want to be.And if other politicians make you feel like you are not part of their family, come on and be part of ours.The thing that makes me angriest about what has gone wrong in the last 12 years is that our government has lost touch with our values, while our politicians continue to shout about them.I'm tired of it!I was raised to believe the American Dream was built on rewarding hard work.And their incomes are still going down.Their taxes are still going up.And the costs of health care, housing and education are going through the roof.Meanwhile, more and more of our best people are falling into poverty even though they work 40 hours a week.Our people are pleading for change, but government is in the way.It has been hijacked by privileged private interests.It has forgotten who really pays the bills around here.It has taken more of your money and given you less in return.We have got to go beyond the brain-dead politics in Washington and give our people the kind of government they deserve, a government that works for them.A President ought to be a powerful force for progress.But right now I know how President Lincoln felt when General McClellan wouldn't attack in the Civil War.He asked him, If you're not going to use your army, may I borrow it?And so I say: George Bush, if you won't use our power to help America, step aside.I will.Our country is falling behind.The President is caught in the grip of a failed economic theory.Now under President Bush, America has an unpleasant economy struck somewhere between Germany and Sri Lanka.And for most Americans, Mr.Sympathy.Al Gore and I can do better.He has raised taxes on the people driving pickup trucks and lowered taxes on the people riding in limousines.In fact, the budgets he has submitted to Congress nearly doubled the debt.Even worse, he wasted billions and reduced our investments in education and jobs.We can do better.So if you are sick and tired of a government that doesn't work to create jobs, if you're sick and tired of a tax system that's stacked against you, if you're sick and tired of exploding debt and reduced investments in our future, or if, like the great civil rights pioneer Fannie Lou Hamer, you're just plain old sick and tired of being sick and tired , then join us, work with us, win with us, and we can make our country the country it was meant to be.Now, George Bush talks a good game, but he has no game plan to rebuild America, from the cities to the suburbs to the countryside, so that we can compete and win again in the global economy.I do.He won't take on the big insurance companies and the bureaucracies to control health costs and give us affordable health care for all Americans, but I will.He won't even implement the recommendations of his own commission on AIDS, but I will.He won't streamline the federal government and change the way it works, cut 100,000 bureaucrats and put 100,000 new police officers on the streets of American cities, but I will.He's never balanced a government budget, but I have 11 times.He won't break the stranglehold the special interests have on our elections and the lobbyists have on our government, but I will.He won't give mothers and fathers the simple chance to take some time off from work when a baby is born or a parent it sick, but I will.We're losing our farms at a rapid rate, and he has no commitment to keep family farms in the family, but I do.He's talked a lot about drugs, but he hasn't helped people on the front line to wage that war on drugs and crime.But I will.He won't take the lead in protecting the environment and creating new jobs in environmental technologies for the 21st century, but I will.Here me now.I am not pro-abortion; I am pro-choice, strongly.I believe this difficult and painful decision should be left to the women of America.I hope the right to privacy can be protected and we will never again have to discuss this issue on political platforms.But I am old enough to remember what it was like before Roe v.Wade, and I do not want to return to the time when we made criminals of women and their doctors.Jobs, education, health care- these are not just commitments from my lips; they are the work of my life.Our priorities must be clear; we will put our people first again.But priorities without a clear plan of action are just empty words.To turn our rhetoric into reality we've got to change the way government does business, fundamentally.They don't want to fix government; they still want to campaign against it, and that's all.But, my fellow Democrats, its time for us to realize we've got some changing to do too.There is not a program in government for every problem, and if we want to use government to help people, we have got to make it work again.Because we are committed in this Convention and in this Platform to making these changes, we are, as Democrats, in the words that Ross Perot himself spoke today, a revitalized Democratic Party.I am well aware that all those millions of people who rallied to Ross Perot's cause wanted to be in an army of patriots for change.Tonight I say to them, join us, and together we will revitalize America.Now, I don't have all the answers, but I do know the old ways don't work.Trickledown economics has sure failed.More choices for young people in the schools they attend- in the public schools they attend.And more choices for the elderly and for people with disabilities and the long-term care they receive.We offer opportunity.We demand responsibility.We will build an American community again.The choice we offer is not conservative or liberal.In many ways, it is not even Republican or Democratic.It is different.It is new.And it will work.He mocks it as the vision thing.But just remember what the Scripture says: Where there is no vision, the people perish.I hope nobody in this great hall tonight, or in our beloved country has to go through tomorrow without a vision.I hope no one ever tries to raise a child without a vision.I hope nobody ever starts a business or plants a crop in the ground without a vision.For where there is no vision, the people perish.One of the reasons we have so many children in so much trouble in so many places in this nation is because they have seen so little opportunity, so little responsibility, so little loving, caring community, that they literally cannot imagine the life we are calling them to lead.And so I say again: Where there is no vision, America will perish.But you must do your part, you must be responsible.We will say: Everybody can borrow money to go to college.But you must do your part.You must pay it back, from your paychecks or, better yet, by going back home and serving your communities.Just think of it.Think of it.Millions of energetic young men and women serving their country by policing the streets or teaching the children or caring for the sick.Or working with the elderly and people with disabilities.But you must do your part.We will say to those on welfare: You will have, and you deserve, the opportunity, through training and education, through child care and medical coverage, to liberate yourself.I know well that the world needs a strong America, but we have learned that strength begins at home.But the New Covenant is about more than opportunities and responsibilities for you and your families.It is time to heal America.And so we must say to every American: Look beyond the stereotypes that blind us.We need each other - all of us - we need each other.Them, the liberals.Them, the poor.Them, the homeless.Them, the people with disabilities.Them, and them, and them.But this is America.There is no them.There is only us.One nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.That is our Pledge of Allegiance, and that's what the New Covenant is all about.How do I know we can come together and make change happen? Because I have seen it in my own state.In Arkansas, we are working together, and we are making progress.No, there's no Arkansas Miracle, but there are a lot of miraculous people.And because of them, our schools are better, our wages are higher, our factories are busier, our water is cleaner and our budget is balanced.We're moving ahead.I wish I could say the same thing about America under the incumbent President.He took the richest country in the world and brought it down.We took on of the poorest states in America and lifted it up.And so I say to all of those, in this campaign season who would criticize Arkansas, come on down.Especially if you're from Washington, come on down.Sure, you'll see us struggling against some of the problems that we haven't solved yet, but you'll also see a lot of great people doing amazing things, and you might even learn a thing or two.In the end, my fellow Americans, this New Covenant simply asks us all to be Americans again- old-fashioned Americans for a new time.Throughout the whole history of this country, we have seen, time and time and time again, that when we are united we are unstoppable.We can seize this moment, make it exciting and energizing and heroic to be American again.We can renew our faith in each other and in ourselves.No President can.We must do it together.It won't be easy, and it won't be quick.We didn't get into this mess overnight, and we won't get out of it overnight.But we can do it- with commitment, creativity, diversity and drive.We can do it.We can do it.We can do it.We can do it.And then, as a student at Georgetown, I head that call clarified by a professor name Carol Quigley, who said to us that America was the greatest Nation in history because our people had always believed in two things- that tomorrow can be better than today and that every one of us has a personal moral responsibility to make it so.That kind of future entered my life the night our daughter, Chelsea, was born.Let it be our cause to give that child a happy home, a healthy family and a hopeful future.Let it be our cause to see that that child has a chance to live to the fullest of her God-given capacities.Let it be our cause to see that child grow up strong and secure, braced by her challenges but never struggling alone, with family and friends and a faith that in America, no one is left out; no one is left behind.Let it be our cause that when this child is able, she gives something back to her children, her community and her country.Let it be our cause that we give this child a country that is coming together, not coming apart, a country of boundless hopes and endless dreams, a country once again lifts its people and inspires the world.Let that be our cause our commitment and our New Covenant.My fellow Americans, I end tonight where it all began for me- I still believe in a place called Hope.God bless you, and God Bless America.",clinton
"I'd like to open our first meeting with a brief prayer.Our Heavenly Father, we thank you for the unique opportunity which has been given to us to serve our country to thy ends.Please be with us and guide us.Keep us humble and eager.And help us to proceed with wisdom.Amen.Well, good morning.I want to say again how very proud I am of all of you and how pleased I am to be off to what I think is quite a good start.And I think we have an enormous reservoir of good will out in the country and a fair amount of elbow room to face the issues that are before us.In the next several days we will have to make a lot of tough economic decisions that some of you have been more involved in than others&mdash;that everybody will be involved in.This should be a fairly good meeting today.I just wanted to make a few remarks and then introduce Mack McLarty and let him talk a little bit.First of all, we're going to have this Cabinet retreat, as you know, in a few days.And some of the issues that we might ordinarily hash out here over an hour or two I think would be better put off until that retreat.If I might begin with sort of a major substantive decision.I basically very much believe in teamwork.And I think that over time you make better decisions if you get good input from a reasonable number of people who have different perspectives.Therefore, for example, when I was Governor, I didn't have a lot of Cabinet meetings, but I had a fair number in which people had the opportunity to comment on matters of public interest that were sometimes outside the narrow confines of what they were doing.",clinton
"Thank you very much.Let me say, first of all, what a wonderful time I have had in your community since I arrived last night.I have seen a lot of your fellow citizens who did not win the lottery.It was 3 degrees, which I suppose means I don't have enough sense to be President.We ran around the park three times and saw some students from the school, and we saw some city employees and others.I flew in here with Congressman Strickland last night, and we had a great visit on the way in.I'm glad to see him over here.And so between the two of them I know a lot about this congressional district and a good deal about this community.I know it has a lot of beautiful old buildings&mdash;I saw them this morning&mdash;and was the first capital of Ohio.Good to see you.Let me say, too, I want to thank your school officials, Superintendent Cline and your principal, Rod Jenkins.And Melissa Hagen did a good job, don't you think? I thought she did a really good job.Maybe she'll be coming back here someday to hold a town meeting like this; you can't tell.I also want to say&mdash;I just have a couple of notes.Normally I don't use them, and I want to put them down, but I asked for some notes about some people in the crowd because they illustrate what to me this effort that I have undertaken as your President is all about.Is John Cochran here? Is he here anywhere? John, are you here? Stand up there.And important to me, he owns the bowling alley.He was unable to come to the Inauguration.I want to say&mdash;is 8-year-old Tiffany Sexton here? Stand up here, Tiffany.Now, these are her parents, Sgt.Anthony and Jerry Sexton; is that right? All of you stand up.I want you to see them.Now, she invited me to dinner and promised to cook&mdash;Tiffany&mdash;so I had to take a rain check, and I asked them to come today.Is Cindy Baker here? Stand up.Cindy Baker has three children, one of whom is a student in this school.She wrote me a half a dozen times in the election, pleading with me to come to Chillicothe.So I thought since she was the first person who invited me, she should be here at this meeting.I also want you to know, you know, we had those famous bus tours, you remember, Hillary and I and Al and Tipper Gore.What you may not know is the people who owned the bus company that we used all during the bus tours all across America are from Ohio.They're from Columbus, and they are here: Barbara and Tom Sabatino and Kerwin and Regina Elmers.Would they stand? They're here somewhere, I think.Yes, in the back.There's Tom, my bus driver.Give him a hand.If it hadn't been for them, we might not have won the election.First, let me say that I was Governor for 12 years of a State with a lot of towns like this one, a lot of counties like Ross County, a lot of manufacturing facilities like the Mead Paper facility here that worked our people and a lot of people who worked on the farm.And we had a pretty tough time in the eighties.We lost a lot of manufacturing jobs, a lot of farm jobs.A lot of our small towns got in trouble.And I was forced to spend a lot of time trying to figure out how we could change things to make a better future for the hard-working good people of my State.So a lot of what I believe about all this goes directly to the experience that I've had for many years working with people like you.If I might, let me just mention one or two things.A lot of our problems stem from all the pressures we're having now in a global economy and stem from the fact that we've got some problems here at home which make it difficult for us to compete in that economy.We have a higher percentage of poor children.We have much more diversity than many of the countries with which we compete.And historically, we have never had the kind of partnership between Government and business and working people that some other countries have.So, for example, if you read yesterday Boeing is laying off a lot of employees in the airline manufacturing business-not affecting Ohio, but it's a big thing for America, in part because of defense cuts but in part because Europe put $26 billion into the airbus project, a direct taxpayer investment, to make sure they could make airplanes that would compete with Boeing, something that we haven't historically done.So we have a new global economy in which there are great opportunities but new challenges.We have some problems here at home that make it hard for us to compete.We have to educate a higher percentage of our people at a higher level.We have to provide basic health care to everybody but control health care costs.All of our major manufacturers are spending 30 percent more for health care than all their competitors around the world, and that puts them in a real bind.And we have many other challenges of this kind that we have to face.Now, for the last 12 years we have followed a certain approach there.We have said as a nation our policy is to keep taxes low on the wealthiest Americans in the hope that they will invest in our economy and make it grow.And that worked.In the last 12 years, the tax burden basically went up on the middle class, went down on the wealthiest Americans, and according to a study released last year, about 70 percent of the economic gains of the last decade went to the top 1 or 2 percent of the people in the country.That was a deliberate decision that was made to try to free up that money in the hope that it would be invested to create new jobs for everybody else.Also, our theory was that the Government should not be too active.So we didn't deal with a lot of the issues that other Governments around the world were dealing with, in Japan, in Germany and other countries, for example.And we actually reduced our investment of your money in a lot of things that make jobs, like the Community Development Block Grant program, which cities in Ohio like because they provide funds not only to do things like repair your parks but also to build roads and rail networks and other support systems for new industry if you're trying to get them into a community.We sort of held the lid on that on the theory that we should just put a big bind on the Government, and all Government spending was bad, and all Government activity should be discouraged, and we'll just see what happens.Well, there have been some not-too-bad years in the last 12.But overall, we've still got a lot of problems.Unemployment's too high.Most people are working harder for lower wages.Health care costs are exploding, but fewer people have health care coverage in this country than any other major country in the world.And the insecurity of losing health insurance is one of the major problems for many, many American families.And we are not educating a high enough percentage of our people at very high levels to compete in this global economy.And because we lowered taxes a lot on the wealthy but could not control the health care costs the Government was spending, we starting running bigger deficits.So that even though we reduced our investment in things like aid for small cities to create jobs, the cost of health care and the cost of interest on our debt exploded, so we've got a huge Government deficit.Our national debt is now 4 times as big as it was in 1980.So when I got elected President, I did it with a conviction that we needed to do the following things: We needed to emphasize investment for jobs and for incomes&mdash;that means investments in new technologies, investments in things like highways and bridges and airports and water systems and sewer systems, investments in the areas that will create jobs for the future, and investments in education of our children all the way from Head Start to college loans, to investments for adults to become retrained if they lose their jobs; second, that we needed to provide affordable health care for all Americans and bring the cost in line with inflation before it bankrupts the country with nothing to show for it; third, that we had to bring down the national debt; and fourth, that we needed a national economic strategy where the American people could work in partnership again to try to grow this economy.Now, we have a lot of tough decisions to make to try to pursue all these objectives at once.The plan I announced to the Congress relies on the following things.Number one, we cut spending, 150 different specific spending cuts, putting a lid on Federal pay increases, cutting the White House staff by 25 percent, cutting the administrative costs of the Federal Government by 14 percent over 4 years, saving billions and billions of dollars.Number two, we raise funds in taxes in a way that I think is fair, with 70 percent of the money coming from people whose incomes are above $100,000 and with a broad-based energy tax that would affect a little bit on oil, a little bit on natural gas, a little bit on coal, so we wouldn't hit any region of the country too much.Thirdly, we increase dramatically something that a lot of you may not know about that's one of the best things in the Tax Code&mdash;it's called the refundable earned-income tax credit-so that no one with an income of $30,000 a year or less would pay any new money under this plan, and so that people who work 40 hours a week and have children in their home would be lifted above poverty for the first time for working, not for welfare but for working.The other thing that you will hear from some of my critics, and so I want to tell you it's true, is that we did actually increase some funds: in the short run, with a plan to jumpstart the economy by creating a half million new jobs; and over the long run, with increases in education programs from Head Start to worker retraining, to apprenticeship programs for high school grads who don't go on to college, to increased access to college loans, to retraining for workers who lose their jobs when there are defense cuts or other cuts in our industry.We have to do that because that's what determines what people's incomes are and whether you can keep people working.We also did increase funds in direct aid to things that create jobs: new technologies and investments to put people to work.So it's a balanced program: deep spending cuts, tax increases fairly applied, and new investments in the areas that create jobs.That's what I'm trying to do.The Congress will decide to vote for it in part based on whether people in towns like Chillicothe all over America think it's a good deal.I can tell you this: The price of doing the same thing is higher than the price of my program.And I'll just give you one example and open the floor to questions.Just since the election, since we made it absolutely clear that we were determined to bring down the deficit, interest rates, long term, have begun to drop.If you look at the difference in long-term interest rates on election day and where they were after I made my speech to Congress, a lot of the people who might have spent $10 or $12 or $15 more per month in energy costs, directly and indirectly, will save much more than that if they're paying a home mortgage, a note on a car, they've got consumer credit, or they otherwise have to borrow money.That's because if you bring the deficit down, you not only free up tax dollars to spend on education and other things, you free up money in the private sector to borrow at lower interest rates.So an awful lot of people are going to save a lot of money on this program immediately.It will create jobs immediately.And the price of it, I am confident, is lower than the price of doing the same old thing.So I thank you for being here.I want to say a special word of thanks to all these Ohio elected officials who are here.I presume they've all been introduced, but I saw Senator Glenn and Senator Metzenbaum and Speaker Rifle, a lot of others here.I thank them for being here.And we're here for you.So thank you very much, and I'll take questions.And if that is willing to help bring the economy up to shape, I am willing to let some of my Social Security go for that economy.And I was wondering if that will affect my Social Security disability any.The short answer to that is it depends on whether you pay any tax now on your income.Let me explain what that means.The only people on Social Security who will pay any more tax are those who pay some tax on it now.That is, in America today, if you drew a Social Security check, and in addition to the Social Security check you have an income of $25,000 a year or more, or if you're a married couple, $32,000 a year or more, one-half of that income is subject to income tax at whatever rate your total income is.We propose to go from half of that to 85 percent, because that is about the amount that the average Social Security recipient should pay taxes on if they get the rest of it for a lifetime.The rest of it, that is, that 15 percent, will equal about what they paid in plus interest.So they get back what they paid in plus interest without taxation on average, and the rest of it would be subject to tax.So the answer is, if you draw Social Security and you pay some tax now, you would pay some more.If you don't pay any tax now, you won't pay any more because your income is too low to be subject to it.My name is Greg Gilmore, and I'm a senior here at Chillicothe High School.How will the new program for college loans and community service be handled? And, to clarify, what process will students have to go through to receive the college loans? Well, we're working out the details now.But let me tell you how I want it to work, okay? And it will be pretty close to this, I think.First of all, let me tell you how it works today.You know, there is a student loan program today, and the more you borrow, the more you have to pay back in short order.And you get the money through your bank, and there's a Government guarantee.Today, that program costs the taxpayers about $4 billion a year: $3 billion in busted loans where people don't pay back the money they owe and $1 billion in transaction fees to the bank.What I hope to be able to do is to have people borrow the money directly from the Government and pay it back at tax time so they can't beat the bill.That will save a huge amount of money.And I want to take the savings and do two things: One is to say to young people, you must pay the money back, but you can pay the money back as a percentage of your income.So that if you make less money, you pay less, and we'll string it out over longer periods of time.So we'll never discourage anybody from being a teacher or working in some other kind of public work just because the salary is low.The second thing we want to do is give people the option either to earn credits against this loan before they go to college, or to do community service after they get out, as teachers or police officers or in other public service.And the way I'm trying to set it up, if you borrowed the maximum amount of money we'd make available and then you worked for 2 years at roughly half pay as a teacher or police officer, that would wipe off your obligation.And you'd pay your loan back by giving something back to your country.And so that's how it's supposed to work.Now, that's more Government spending all right, but see, that's a direct investment in you.That's not expanding some Government program.That's putting the money direct into you.That's cutting the cost of a program and increasing investment in your future.President, I'm a student member from Pickley Ross Vocational Center.Since there is a critical need in this country for skilled workers, I'm excited about your youth apprenticeship program.My question is what role will public vocational education play in your youth apprenticeship program? The short answer is, a big one.The longer answer is, here's how I want to set it up.What we're trying to do at the national level is to come up with enough funds to match with local funds and to encourage private sector people to get into an apprenticeship program which will be an American version of what the Europeans have done for years.I've asked the Labor Secretary, Bob Reich, to work with the Education Department, the vocational people in the private sector to try to set up a framework within which every State in America would be able to design a program that a person, a young man or woman, could enter in high school if they wanted, and they would continue for at least 2 years after high school.Let me tell you why we have to do that very quickly.If you look at the income charts on American earnings from, oh, let's say for the last 20 years, for the last 20 years you see a bigger and bigger and bigger gap every year between the earnings of young people with college degrees and young people who drop out of high school or young people who had only a high school diploma.However, if you look at the earnings of young people who get at least 2 years of training after high school in a vocational institution, the community colleges, in the service, or on the job, if it is high-quality training, a great deal of that job gap is closed, and the young person moreover acquires the ability to continue to learn new things throughout a lifetime.The best programs are those which start in the high schools and run with some continuity for 2 years thereafter.And so there is no magic answer.We're going to have to design these sector by sector in the economy, and the National Government can't do it.We can just set up a framework and standards and provide some of the funds, but we're going to have to do it on a State-by-State and sector-by-sector basis.But that's what we have to do.We need to get&mdash;first of all, my dream would be no high school dropouts, and then for 100 percent of the high school graduates to have at least 2 years of some kind of very high-quality training that is approved by both education and the private sector.Some would be delivered in schools; some would be delivered in the job place.Mr.President, once reimbursement for Medicare is reduced, what actions will be implemented to prevent health care providers from shifting costs to the private sector? Well, first of all, that is a bigger problem with Medicaid than Medicare, as you know, I'm sure.The budget that I introduced to do that, to cut down on Medicare reimbursement, is a budget that assumes we're not going to do anything else about health care.Within 100 days of my taking office, we're going to present a plan to the Congress to try to deal with the cost shifting problem.The question she asked indicates a real understanding of the problem.If all you do is to cut what the Government pays to doctors and hospitals, if you cut it below their real costs, then the medical providers will fund a way to recover their real costs from people who pay directly or through private insurance, and the insurance premiums will go up more.So what we have to do is to do what every other country in the world but America has done and develop some sort of all-payer system where the reimbursement levels are pretty much the same and where you have real efforts to eliminate unnecessary duplication and waste and paperwork that benefit the private sector along with the public sector, and that's what we're going to do.In other words, I just presented the best budget I could with the system we've got, but what we need is a comprehensive system which eliminates the cost shifting from the Medicare and Medicaid to the private sector and has some cost reduction mechanisms that benefit everybody.Let me say&mdash;I don't know, there must be some people that work at the factories in town or work in other manufacturing facilities.Our program has some significant tax incentives over the next 5 years for businesses big and small to reinvest, to create jobs, and to become more productive.But the best thing we could do, better than an investment tax credit, better than the tax changes for big manufacturers, the best thing we could do is to find a way to get health costs in line with inflation and still take care of everybody in America.If you did that, you'd free up hundreds of billions of dollars to make America compete again.And so that's a very good question.Yes, let's take one over here.We haven't taken any over here.President, as a member of the UAW and local union president, I'm concerned about the loss of American jobs to foreign countries.What impact will the North American Free Trade Act have on the economy and the budget deficit? The North American Free Trade Agreement, in my opinion, will help the economy and reduce the budget deficit if, but only if, it is implemented in a way that protects us from unfair practices.What I want to do is to get the North American Free Trade Agreement ratified, if we can also get an agreement that requires the Mexican Government and private sector to invest in environmental investments to get their environmental cost up to ours, so we don't have people just running down there so they can evade all the Clean Air Act and all those other acts in America.And I want to have some labor standards agreements that will reassure us that the Mexican Government will enforce even their own labor laws.One of the things that&mdash;I don't know if you all remember one of the television ads I ran in the last campaign about an American program where we were actually subsidizing companies that would move their plants overseas, and some of them went to Central America and lowered wages.They didn't raise wages down there; they went down there and lowered wages.So what we have to know is that we are actually strengthening the Mexican economy so they will buy more.Now, let me say this in defense of President Salinas.In the last 5 years, our trade deficit with Mexico has gone from a huge deficit to a slight surplus, and our volume has gone way up.So they bought a lot more from us than we sold to them relative to where we were 5 or 6 years ago.But this agreement, I'm convinced, needs some strengthening in order to avoid hurting the American work force.I do think, if you look at it over the long run, a country like ours can only get wealthier by selling more to other countries.And it's easier to sell to your neighbors than it is to people far away.And so far, Mexico has not been wealthy enough to buy a significant volume of our goods.Let me give you an example.Our biggest trading partner by far is Canada, even though it's a tiny country; it's a big country geographically, but in terms of population they only have about 30 million people.But they buy a huge amount of our stuff, by far our biggest trading partner.So we would be better off&mdash;one of the reasons the Japanese and the Germans have gotten so much richer so much quicker in the last 10 years is that they've been selling more stuff overseas.So I've got to try to make that a market.It's good for us over the long run, but I'm going to try to do it in a way that builds up the American manufacturing base, not tears it down.The Senate Report, 97th Congress, S.158, concludes that, Physicians, biologists and other scientists agree that conception marks the beginning of the life of the human being.And it goes on to say, There's overwhelming agreement on this point in countless medical, biological, and scientific writings.The Constitution of the United States guarantees life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.My question for you, Mr.President, is deep down inside do you believe that life begins at conception? And if so, why are we denying the right to life for the 4,400 human beings a day and 1.6 million human beings a year in the murder of an abortion? Wait a minute.Okay.Good.At least you have a consistent position.He said yes.That was his answer.His answer was yes.Then that brings me to the question&mdash;there are two different issues here, not one.One is the biological question: Is a cell a living thing? Answer? If two cells join in the process that begins to make a human being, are they living? Answer? No one disputes that.That's not the issue.The issue is a much deeper one, and one over which people have argued for a long time, one over which Christians have argued for a long time: When does the soul enter the body so that to terminate the living organism amounts to killing a person? That is the question.It is a deep, moral question over which serious Christians disagree.I have heard&mdash;you may smile with all your self-assurance, young man, but there are many Christian ministers who disagree with you.And the question is&mdash;and let me say, I honor your convictions.I worked very hard in my State to reduce the number of abortions.I don't like abortion.The question for policymakers on the issue of whether Roe v.Wade should be repealed is the question of whether we really are prepared to go all the way and make women and their doctors criminals because we believe we know that.Now, you are.But here's the problem.In a great democratic society, you have to be very careful what you apply the criminal law to.For example, we make drugs criminal, right? And we throw a lot of people in jail, and our jails are full and they're just doubling all the time because they're so full.And 90 percent of us agree that drug use should be criminal, and we've still got the jails full.You have to be very careful when you know that there is a difference that splits the American people fight down the middle.Very few Americans believe that all abortions all the time are all right.Almost all Americans believe that abortion should be illegal when the children can live without the mother's assistance, when the children can live outside the mother's womb.There is about a 50-50 split in our country of honest conviction about whether terminating a baby in the mother's womb before the baby can live outside the mother's womb amounts to what you say it does, which is first degree murder.So the reason I support Roe v.Wade and the reason I signed a bill to make abortion illegal in the third trimester is because I think that the Government of this country should not make criminal activities over which even theologians are in serious disagreement.That's how I feel.Mr.President, I'm a sophomore here at Chillicothe High School.Will there be jobs for me when I graduate college? There will be if my economic program has a chance to be put in, I think.But let me say this: The most maddening thing in the world for me as a public servant is to see people who want to work, who don't have jobs.A year ago yesterday we celebrated the first anniversary of the first primary in our Presidential campaign in New Hampshire.And so I made a few calls there, and I was reminiscing yesterday about going into New Hampshire, a State that tripled the unemployment rate in 3 years, and listening to young people like you tell me that the worst thing about their lives was going home at night when their parents, who had lost their jobs through no fault of their own, and they couldn't even bear to talk at the dinner table anymore.But it is the big challenge.What is happening is all these big companies are restructuring.They're trying to be more competitive in a global economy, and they're laying people off.And small companies have to make up the difference, and a lot them can't borrow money from the bank, and there aren't markets there.All I can tell you is I'm doing the very best I can to make sure that there will be jobs available for you.That is the issue.If we cannot maintain America's position and the American dream unless we are able to create a higher number of jobs every year.This is amazing.We're supposed to be coming out of this recession we've been in, and unemployment's higher now than it was at the bottom of the recession.So the answer to your question is, I honestly believe that if my program is given a chance to work, it will create jobs for young people like you.That's what I honestly believe.I believe that.President.My name is Barbara Smith, and I'm a concerned citizen.And my question is, instead of imposing an energy tax which would unequally affect consumers, why not develop a national sales tax which would be equal to all consumers, or even a national lottery, to help with the deficit? A lottery is a different issue.I doubt it would raise a great deal of money, and I've always been opposed to them, because lotteries tend to have an unequal effect, taking a disproportionate amount of money from lower income people.So I've always been opposed to that.But let's talk about the national sales tax.Almost every country that I know of that we compete with, advanced countries, all the European countries and Japan and Canada, have a national sales tax.They call it a value-added tax.Most of them&mdash;if you go to Canada you see it on your bill&mdash;you know, they separate it out, just like the sales tax.But most countries just put the value-added tax into the wholesale price, and you don't even see it on your bill.And a lot of those countries like that because what they do is they tax things sold in their country.Now, what's good about that? That means that&mdash;let's take, again, your plant here&mdash;if Mead Paper makes, let's say, stationery and sells 15 percent of its products overseas, those products would not be subject to the VAT tax.Or, you're in the UAW, if you make an automobile, and any automobile you sold in another country would be subject to no tax at all.Then, when another country's car came in here, it would be subject to the tax.So a lot a people in manufacturing like this national sales tax because it helps your exports, and it puts a burden on imports coming in, supports the job base of the country.It's perfectly legal; all our other competitors do it.Now, here's why I didn't propose it right now.That is a radical change in the tax system of the United States.It is something I think we may well have to look at in the years ahead.But I did not want to confuse two different things: One is the imperative of getting the deficit down, with the need to maybe change our tax system.I mean, there's only so much change a country can accommodate at the same time.Also, the energy tax equals about 1.5 percent of total Federal revenues, or 1.6 percent.And it will have a very modest impact on energy, and it is pretty equal throughout the regions of the country, actually.If you take a farmer, you might argue that a farmer might pay a little more directly or indirectly because if you buy fuel it's about 2 cents a gallon, but then if you buy fertilizer, that's got a lot of fuel in it.So the only people who will be unevenly affected are people who buy things that have a lot of fuel component.But I thought, and by the way, we still have the lowest energy cost by far of any of our competitors, and our energy taxes are very low.If it were to put us out of compliance, I might have thought of that.But I do believe that America, at another time, and maybe not too long in the fixture, will debate whether we want to shift the nature of our tax system because we're in a global economy.But let me say one other thing.If you do a value-added tax, if you do a national sales tax, you have to be really careful to be fair to people.You have to exempt food; you have to exempt maybe clothing or a certain amount of allowance.You've got to be careful how you do it so you don't make it a regressive tax.But they can be designed that way, and we're the only major nation without one.President, my name is Cathy Dunn.My mother's monthly prescription drug cost exceeds her monthly income on retirement.What, if anything, can be done about the rising cost of drugs in this country? Well, one problem is that older people who are eligible for Medicare, but not poor enough to be on Medicaid, don't have their prescription drugs covered.So you have this ironic development that older people who have serious medical problems and require expensive medicine who are on Medicare might actually have lower incomes&mdash;real incomes&mdash;than some people on Medicaid.And it's a big gap in our health care system, and it's one that I'm going to try to see that we address now.Let me say, you may have seen on the other end of the age spectrum, I've been in somewhat of a dispute with some of the drug companies because I want to immunize all the children in our country.But only about half of our 2-year-olds are immunized against serious diseases.That's a very serious thing.And I'm coming back to the drug problem.Let me bring you back around to this, because it's very important that you understand this.And we save $10 later for every $1 we invest now in immunizations of children for preventable diseases.And yet, a lot of vaccines made in America sell for lower prices overseas than they sell in America.Now, if you look at the price of vaccines-for a lot of these vaccines, the most expensive price goes to the family doctor who buys them.That's why the cost of getting your shots has gone from about, oh, $10 to over $200 if you just go to a family doctor and get all the baby's shots.Right? Next cheapest is, State government can buy vaccines in bulk.The next cheapest is, the Federal Government can buy even bigger&mdash;vaccines-and we buy through a Federal agency about 40 percent of the vaccines in the country, and then we give them out to the States.And then the States that have good public health networks, they give them out, and those shots are the cheapest of all.But even cheaper than that are some of these same vaccines made by American companies sold in foreign countries.Now, that all sounds terrible.Let me say one or two things, since I've been fighting with the drug companies, in defense of them.They're a very important part of our economy.They do a wonderful job in finding new drugs to solve problems.They have to spend a fortune to do all the research and development.The problem is that to sell those vaccines in other countries, these other countries are tougher on them, and because they want everybody immunized, they drive down the cost of the vaccines.So Americans are paying the whole research and development costs for people who benefit from these drugs all over the world, because the companies can't collect other places.Another problem is that we have more lawsuits in this country, so we add about $4 a vial to the vaccines to put into a fund against the possibility that some child might have a reaction.So they would always be somewhat more expensive.But we have got to find a way to work with the drug companies.They do very well, I want to emphasize.They are some of our best companies.But we've got to find a way to deal with these two huge problems.One is older people, particularly, paying huge prices for drugs that have been developed for some time, that are not experimental drugs.I think we'd all admit we should pay more for experimental drugs; that's got all the research cost in it.And the second is children in America paying more for vaccines than children in other countries, even though they were made here.And we're trying to work through that, and I think we're going to make some progress on it.President, I am one of those family doctors who you were speaking about, and I have a couple of questions.One is, in your address to the joint session of Congress, nothing was mentioned about tort reform.And I'm very concerned about that because of the malpractice crisis and the liability costs in malpractice insurance.The second thing is, our local medical society has reviewed at least four plans put forward by organized medicine, the American Academy of Family Physicians and so on.Are you going to look at those programs and incorporate physicians' ideas as you're formulating the policies? Absolutely.And we will also bring doctors into the process.But let me answer the second question first.Last year there were two major suggestions made for health care reform by physicians groups, the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Family Practice.A more modest but still significant program was offered by the American Medical Association.And the American Nurses Association put out a very interesting plan.And I think all of those things should have a big influence on what we do, because in the end it's the doctors and the other health care providers that have to live with whatever system we put out.So the answer to your question is yes, those suggestions, and in particular the two you mentioned, are being taken very seriously.Second, on cutting the cost of malpractice, that's a big issue with me.I'm proud of the fact that my State had the second lowest malpractice rates in the country.And one of the things we did was to pass a law enabling the court to fine anyone who brought a frivolous tort suit, if it was judged to be frivolous, that the lawyer himself or herself could actually be fined.Not a big fine, but it had a real impact.The other thing I think that has real promise is an experiment that I believe is now being tried in Maine and one or two other places which really relates to family practitioners, because we cannot get medical reform in this country unless family practitioners, family doctors, feel freer to set simple fractures, to get back into the business of delivering babies, to do that whole range of things.The thing that a lot of people are working on now is being able to say to doctors in small towns and rural areas, for example, here are a set of accepted practice guidelines for this procedure or that procedure.If you can show that you have followed these guidelines, that will raise a presumption against malpractice for you.I think that has real promise.The third thing in really expensive areas is, we might all look at what's been done in the vaccine area.That really worked, where people just pay a fee into a fund and a big national fund is set up.And if there's a problem, you go against that fund; you don't have to go through a whole prolonged lawsuit with an insurance company, a lawyer, a doctor, and all the lawyers and all that.That's something else that I think we need to look at to see if that might have more general application.I'm a simple woman.What I need to hear from you is, over the next 4 years, how much spending cuts, dollar-wise, will we see? How much total revenue will be brought through our taxes, through the increase in our taxes? And what percentage of that is going towards new programs? In other words, we're hearing tax and spend, the old Republican motto about the Democrats.I want you to show me in a simple manner exactly the dollar figures that we'll look at over the next 4 years.I don't know if I can do the math in my head right now for 4 years, but I will tell you, basically, the tax bill goes from about $20 billion to about $75 billion over the next 4 years; the spending cuts go up to more than that in the fourth year.In the early years there are more tax increases than spending cuts; in the later years there are far more spending cuts than tax increases.At the end, they're about the same.The net aggregate reduction in the deficit over 4 years is about $320 billion, over 5 years is at $475 billion less debt than we would otherwise have.In the fourth year of the budget, which is the one that we all target on under the Federal system, the deficit will go down $140 billion a year in that year.Essentially, there will be a net increase in that fourth year in spending of about $26 billion a year.That is, there's about $40 billion more in spending, net new spending, all targeted toward things like the college loan program, Head Start, new technologies, and jobs and about $15 billion in additional tax incentives to businesses to reinvest in new jobs.So that's what the net new spending is.But if you look at it total in the first 4 years, the spending cuts and the revenue increases are about equal.If you string it out for 4 more years, if we really change the spending habits of the country, the spending cuts are far greater than the tax increases.And I've got a little chart.I'll send it to you, and you can see exactly how much year by year in each of the three categories.Let me just make this point on the spending cuts.I have spent a month during which we have worked almost around the clock trying to get a handle on this budget.The Federal budget is put together in a way that I don't think is very good, and it doesn't resemble any business budget or any State or local budget you have ever seen.Let me give you an example.I wrote a letter to the Agency that is supposed to be helping me put together the budget&mdash;a memo&mdash;and I said, here are about 30 questions I want answered.One question was, how much more money are we collecting a day than we were 5 years ago in tax money, and how much of revenue has grown in each of the last 5 years? You know what the answer was that I got back from the Agency? Federal revenues as a percentage of our gross national product are slightly smaller than they were 5 years ago.So help me, that was the answer I got back, I promise.In other words, just to your point, we were taking more money in, and tax revenues had grown less fast than the economy, but what difference did that make; we had more money.They didn't even answer the questions.I'll send you the exact chart.But it's basically 50-50 spending cuts, revenue increases for the first 4 years.Spending cuts swamped revenue increases in the second 4 years and will go much more if we adopt a new health care control plan.And the investment increases are significant but modest.They reflect a big change in the spending priorities.One of the things I'm trying to do is change; Government is great at starting things and bad at stopping things.So we're still, believe it or not, you're still paying for a bicentennial commission.That was over in 1976.And there are lots of things.It's a little bit of money, but you can't justify it.It's just terrible.And there's a lot of stuff in there like that.So what I'm trying to do is to flush that out, reduce consumption, and increase investment so that we can put some people to work.That's what I'm trying to do.And I'll send you the chart.When I spoke on Thursday night I tried to give the exact numbers in the last, but I will be glad to-I mean, that chart was in the book that we presented to the Congress.And I was hoping that it would be run in all the newspapers in the country, because there is a chart in the book we released to the press on Thursday morning.Anybody who wants that chart, I'll be glad to give it to you.Let me make one final point about that: I have no interest in raising a penny in taxes if we're not going to do the cuts.I don't want to get a deal where we're going to raise the money and not do the cuts.Not a penny.The second point is, I don't have any pride of authorship in this.I've been working on this like crazy for 4 weeks.There must be people who know more about some of these things than I do.And I have invited all the people in the Congress, Republicans as well as Democrats, and all the people in the country to help us find more.I'm more than open to it.But I have to say, too, there are some tough decisions involved in the cuts.As you know, there is a uranium enrichment facility in this congressional district not far from here.And one of the things we've concluded is that there are only two in the country, and both are running at about half capacity&mdash;with the projected need going down&mdash;is that we will have to close one of those.So there are tough decisions involved in this.There are a lot of tough decisions that have to be made in this cut area.But if anybody's got any more ideas about how we can cut more, I'd like to have them.President, I'm Mayor of a small town.We have two employees.About the last 8 years, health insurance went from $400 a month to $1,500 a month for two employees.If you can have Hillary get this health insurance in line, it will help our little village.Plus, I'm on economic development in our county, and our biggest employer makes television sets.And if that health care comes down, it will sure help those stay in business, too.So tell Hillary to keep on it.And if you get that down, we'll send her a big thanks.Thank you.Let me say, this is a subject, probably a whole subject for another town meeting.But let me say that one of my biggest problems with a lot of you in dealing with health care is this: If you ask the American people a question about health care, are we spending too much or too little, a lot of people will say we're spending too little.Why? Because they feel insecure about losing their health insurance.Or because, like your mother, they're spending too much out of pocket.So if you ask the American people, are we spending too much or too little, a lot of people say too little.That's wrong.We're spending too much and on the wrong things.That young doctor that stood up here, I'll bet you anything more than 30 percent of his gross income goes to paperwork.Right? We are the only country in the world where you have 1,500 separate health insurance companies writing thousands of policies with every doctor's office and every hospital in America having to keep up with them.Just for example, the average country we complete with, of every dollar people spend on health care, 95 cents on the dollar goes to health care, a nickel to run the administrative programs.In America, it's more like 86 cents.You figure out what 9 cents on the dollar is&mdash;or 11 cents on the dollar&mdash;for an $840 billion health bill, or if you take the Government out of it, about $600 billion.You just figure it out.It's lots of money.President.I'm John Cooper, and I go to a private school.And in years past we have not had any support from the Government with funds.And I was just wondering if you had a plan that will help pay for some of the taxes that we have.And I was wondering, if you don't have one, why not? I'll tell you why not.I don't, and I'll tell you why not.When I was a boy, I went 2 years to a private school, to a wonderful Catholic school.And we paid tuition.And my folks were not wealthy.They were working people when we did it.And I was living way out in the country, and we moved to a new community, and we just didn't know anything about the school.And I've always treasured that experience.But I don't believe, particularly right now, that we can afford to give tuition tax credits or other breaks to fund private schools, even though I support the competition private schools give to public schools.And I'll tell you why.President&mdash; Let me tell you why.Even though I'll bet you anything you've raised more money in this State to put into this school system we're in right now, the United States today is behind at least eight of its major competitors in the percentage of our income we spend on kindergarten through 12th grade education.And we have more problems in our schools than most of our competitors because we have more income diversity and more racial and ethnic diversity, and a lot of our schools are located in places where there are a lot of tough economic problems.So I don't think we can afford to do that now.I wish I could tell you what you want to hear, but I just don't agree with it.Mayor Joe Sulzer.Mr.President, I'm sorry, but we have time for only one more question over here, and then we'll have a special presentation.And then we would ask everyone to remain seated as the President leaves.Thank you.Participation in Government May I ask a question? May I ask you something before we get off, Mayor? These things always work like this.We could stay here till the cows come home to do this.And I love this.And you've been great.I want to make two points, and then I'll answer the last question, whichever, whoever the Mayor designates to be the last question.The first is that one of the things I've been really proud of in the last month&mdash;it proved the election worked, it proved all the town meetings worked, it proved the Ross Perot charts worked, it proved the whole thing worked&mdash;is that the volume of our mail and telephone calls is running at historic highs in the White House.That means the American people&mdash;a lot of its people who disagree with me, a lot of its people who agree, a lot of its people who are just asking honest questions-but my point is, it means people believe maybe their Government can be made to work for them again and maybe we can be accountable again.So a lot of you have questions you haven't gotten answered today.I would encourage you to write to us.I have reorganized the White House Correspondence Office.I've tried to put a number of people there who really understand the issues that I believe in and the things that we care about.We're trying to minimize the number of just formal responses we give&mdash;unless people send us a form letter; that's different-but I mean people that really write us.So I would encourage you to do that.The second thing I want to do is to say that I want to encourage you to continue to hold me and everybody else accountable and ask the tough questions.I don't think it was all that easy for that young man to stand up there and ask the question he asked on abortion because he knew he had a different position than I did.And I was proud of him for doing that, and I think you should be, too.And believe me, none of us have all of the answers.This is a new and uncharted time.And I want to encourage you to continue to believe in your country and to participate in this.Hold our feet to the fire, but try to make it a constructive thing.This is an exciting time for this country and it's sort of a make-or-break time, I think, and I'm doing the best I can and I think you are, too.And if we keep doing that, I think the chances are we're going to come out okay.I think I can say for the other elected officials here, I'll bet you they're pretty proud of their constituents in Ohio after this town meeting.Who is last, Mayor? Who did you select, Mayor? Mayor Sulzer.Right over there, Mr.President.President, I'm a sixth grader at Smith Middle School, and I'm wondering, do any parts of your education plan deal with children my age? Good for you.Okay.The answer is yes, but most of them don't.And let me tell you why&mdash;the answer is yes, they do.We emphasize more funds and more efforts in math and science education, for example.And I have asked the Congress to give the Education Department some funds that will enable us to target learning strategies in elementary and junior high and high school that work, and try to get schools to repeat them.Do you know that every problem in American education has been solved by somebody, somewhere? I mean, this is not like looking for a cure for some disease we haven't found a cure for yet.What we are not good at in American education is taking what works in one place and putting it in place another.So the two major things are, we're trying to repeat education strategies that have given young people in the sixth grade great performance in some places; we want to try to put them in all the schools in the country.And secondly, we're going to make a special effort on math and science education.Now, let me answer the other question.Most of the funds that I have recommended in education, most of the effort will be going to try to make sure kids get off to an equal start in school: fully funding the Head Start program, supporting schools and their preschool programs, trying to make sure that child nutrition and child health care is good, and then when children leave school, trying to make sure that they have a vocational program, a job training program, a college program to go to.Why? Because over 90 percent of the cost of the public schools, kindergarten through 12th grade, comes from the State and local level.I can have an impact on your education only if we focus on a few issues where we can really help, like how do you get more computers in schools, how do you do better with math and science.But most of the money comes from the State and local level.Whereas, a lot of what we have to do for children before they start school and after they graduate from high school has to come from the national level, and that's why we do it that way.Thank you very much.You were great.",clinton
"Today I have signed into law H.R. 5630, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001.I am pleased that the Act no longer contains the badly flawed provision that would have made a felony of unauthorized disclosures of classified information, and that was the basis for my veto of a previous version of this legislation.I thank the Congress for working with me to produce a bill that I can sign.I appreciate the inclusion of section 308 concerning the applicability of Federal laws implementing international treaties and other international agreements to United States intelligence activities.Section 308 applies only to intelligence activities of the United States and addresses particular concerns regarding the potential application of future United States domestic laws implementing international agreements to otherwise lawful and appropriately authorized intelligence activities.This provision does not in any way address the proper interpretation of preexisting implementing legislation or other United States statutes, nor does it in any way address other United States Government activities.Title VIII of the Act sets forth requirements governing the declassification and disclosure of Japanese Imperial Army records, as defined by the Act.The executive branch has previously been declassifying United States Government records related to Japanese war crimes under the provisions of the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act, Public Law 105-246; consequently, I understand that title VIII does not apply to records undergoing declassification pursuant to the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act.Finally, I acknowledge the efforts of the Congress to bring about a more capable, secure, and effective Diplomatic Telecommunications System.I am concerned, however, that the proposed changes for the Diplomatic Telecommunications Service Program Office do not yet represent the best methods for improving the management of this system.As the executive branch implements this legislation, I encourage the Congress to work with the executive branch to consider alternatives for further improvements.",clinton
"Thank you very much, my good friend James Roosevelt, who has likewise been an inspiration to me over the years, and who knows and cares a great deal about a subject that we must all come to grips with this year, the crisis in health care; to Senator Pat Moynihan, one of the most productive people in public life in the 20th century in America.And Mrs.Cuomo, I'm delighted to see you here, and we wish Governor Cuomo good health.He might have thought to himself, on deciding whether to do the responsible thing and take to his sick bed today, that he's probably heard this speech before and he's probably given it before.We had a delightful time in The White House, Hillary and I and Governor and Mrs.Cuomo, not very long ago.It's something I will treasure for a long time.I'm glad to see Lieutenant Governor Lundine and Attorney General Abrams and Members of the Congress, and members of both parties from the New York Assembly and State Senate, and people here who are here because you are Americans.You're Republicans, Democrats, independents.I am glad to see you all here in this monument to America's possibility.I wanted to come here for a thousand reasons, some of which are obvious.And I read a lot about Hyde Park.And the thing that moved me most was the way President Roosevelt came to grips with the fact of his polio and learned to live with it and learned to triumph over it and learned to use it to make himself stronger inside and not to be defeated by it.And ever since, I have been transformed from someone who had a mild interest in coming here to someone who had a burning passion to see this place.And I am honored to be here today.I want to say one more word, if I might, about Senator Moynihan because we've worked together over the years on a lot of things.I helped him to rewrite the welfare laws of our Nation in the late eighties and what he said was the most significant social welfare reform in 30 years, if only we could implement it.And one of the reasons I ran for President is to try to change the welfare system as we know it.I have watched him over more than two decades personally warn us about the decline of America's families, the development of a new and possibly permanent underclass in America, the importance of restoring the value of work to our social programs, a decade ago warning about the breakup of what was then the Soviet Union when most people thought that he was speaking a foreign language.And I can tell you that with leadership like his we can solve the problems this country faces today.That's good.We were about 45 or 50 minutes away from here when we landed in the airplane, and all along the way there were people, school children, hundreds of them, lining the way with their signs, and the young people at Marist College having even printed signs.Many people were young; some were older.A lot of them were terribly young.Most of them were, I'd say, between '20 and 50, anyway.I find myself redefining that word every year.And there are all kinds of incredible things: Get the U.S.fit, one sign said.I want to give something to my country, another said.One I might have to give a trip to the doctor.It said, I want to pay more taxes.I couldn't believe that.One sign said, Give Bill a chance.One said, Turn my country around.Another said, I've got a B.A.and no job; I'm ready to change.Another said, Just do something.Then, of course, there were a few that weren't so favorable, but that's all right.That's what this country's all about, too.But I couldn't believe the number of people who were there.And I say that because as much as anything else, I think our country now is infused with a new sense of possibility.One of the things that really used to depress me as I crossed America last year was the look I saw in so many people's eyes of skepticism, almost a painful unwillingness to believe that we can make things better, that we could change, that we could come to grips with the challenges of our time and overcome them and move forward.One of the things that I think&mdash;perhaps the most important thing that was achieved in the last election year was we had a huge increase in turnout, an even bigger increase among younger people.And now every day the White House switchboard and the mailroom are fuller than they have been in decades and decades because people believe that it matters again.This country has been kept going through two centuries now because of the peculiar mix of the energy of its people at the grassroots level and the vision of its leaders.But if you have one without the other, the country can't go forward.There have been times in the past when leaders have foreseen the future and known what needed to be done, but there was no connection with the people and so nothing could happen.There have been many times, I'm convinced, when the people have been ahead of their leaders.But if they had no visionary leaders, nobody to put all that energy together with the levers of public authority, nothing happened.We all hope, I think, from whatever perspective we come, that we now have a moment in our history where we have the energy of the people and a direction we can take.I ran for President because I believe this was a critical moment in our country's history.And there have been many over the last two centuries.I think of the Founding Fathers, who actually welded a nation out of 13 independent colonies when many people&mdash;maybe if you'd even taken a poll, a majority of the people would have said, Who wants one army? Who wants one currency? Who wants to really give up all this independence we have in New York or South Carolina? What do we have in common with those people down there? I think of Thomas Jefferson.Some people thought he was crazy when he ponied up $15 million to buy something then called the Louisiana Purchase, which most Americans could not even imagine and hardly anyone had ever seen.And if he hadn't done it, since I live on the edge of the Louisiana Purchase, you'd be listening to somebody from somewhere else give this speech today.I think of Abraham Lincoln.We now take it for granted that the Union would be preserved, that the slaves would be freed, that all this would happen.The truth is that a great many people thought there was no way to hold this Nation together.And a great deal of what did it was his vision and his sheer will.I think of President Roosevelt in the depths of the Depression, having gone through his personal journey to cope with his personal problems, summoning interior strength and reserve to lift the Nation's vision and to make people believe again that by taking one step at a time, by coming and building a beautiful school like this with the WPA&mdash;that if you did enough things like this and you just kept trying long enough, sooner or later we would go forward, we would work our way out of it by what he called then bold, persistent experimentation.Today, I think we need that kind of experimentation based on the plain evidence that we are in a rut.What we have been doing is not working to deal with the problems we face.For about two decades, through administrations of both parties' Presidents, we've been steadily moving into a global economy which is much more competitive, where other countries have been growing more rapidly than we and moving toward our standard of living, where we have to compete in all forms of economic life in ways that can force us to endure real pain, as you folks in this part of the country have seen recently with the difficulties that a magnificent company, IBM, has been forced to come to grips with.This is not an isolated event.This is part of the passage of time and the economic realities in which we live.That global economy abroad has presented us with a lot of challenges and a lot of opportunities here.But our ability to deal with it has been limited by a lot of the educational and training and social problems we have here at home, our racial and ethnic and income diversity, the high rates of violence and the whole pockets of poverty we have in this country, and lack of investment.We have seen that there are a lot of things that are just not quite fitting very well.And now we've had two decades in which the wages of most Americans have been stagnant compared to inflation.And when you look at the rising cost of education, health care, housing, the tax burden, most Americans are working harder today than they were 10 years ago for real, disposable income that is less, because of these sweeping trends.For 12 years, we have tried a clear approach to our country's problems.When President Reagan was elected in 1980, he ran with a clear sense of what he wished to do.He said, The Government is the problem here.It causes inflation.It causes middle-class people to have trouble.What we need is a very restricted role for Government.And we will also lower taxes on everybody, but most of all on the wealthiest Americans.Because if we give them their money back, they will invest it in America, create jobs, drive up incomes, increase jobs, and we will be the most prosperous country in the world.Well, I believe that free enterprise is the engine of growth in America.We are fundamentally a conservative, private, capitalist free enterprise country.But every other nation with which we compete decided to take a slightly different course.They said to themselves in Germany and Japan: Well, we're in a global economy in which the government and the people in the private sector have to work together.We've got to work together to train and educate our people as well as possible.We've got to work together to have economic policies that encourage investment over consumption so we can always be competitive.We've got to have a good trade policy, and we've got to do things that make it possible to create high-wage, high-growth jobs so that all the students who go to school here will have a future, and so that America will be strong.That's what I think we have to do.In other words, that is my vision.That is not what we have done.What we have done is to try for 12 years to cramp the role of Government.Now, look what's happened in practice.In practice, we have lowered taxes on the wealthiest Americans.Taxes on the middle class have actually gone up in the last 12 years.We have run a horrendous Government deficit.The deficit is now 4 times as big as it was in 1980.We have seen spending go up in areas that the Government would have to move to control, mostly health care and then interest on the debt, because when the deficit gets bigger and bigger and bigger, you spend more money on the debt.So we have reduced investment, increased the debt, moved money upward so that there's been much more inequality of income distribution, but we have not seen the kind of investment that creates high-wage, high-growth jobs in the emerging technologies that guarantee a future for all the young people that live here and throughout our land.So I ran for President because I really believe we ought to try a different course.Not to blame past Presidents; if you look at what's happened in Washington, none of it could have happened if there hadn't been bipartisan support for the course and support in Congress as well as in the White House.This is not about blame.I want to simply take responsibility.And as I told the Congress the other night, if we turn this country around, I don't care who gets the credit for it, either.I just think the time has come to make a change.We have tried one thing 12 years.It obviously has problems.It is time to change.Now, what does that mean? Change for change sake is not good.What does it mean? It means to me that we should do the following things.First of all, the Government should pursue a policy of increasing investment in those things which contribute to a growing economy.What are those things? We should invest more than we are now and more toward what our competitors do, in the infrastructure of the country, in transportation and communications, in environmental cleanup, in those things which increase productivity and put people to work.It means we should do whatever it takes to educate people for a lifetime at very high levels, because the skill level of the work force is the single most important determinant of income and the capacity to grow new jobs rapidly as new areas of opportunity open up.It means that we should invest in partnership with the private sector in new technologies which will determine the future of the country.And it means we should not give up on those areas where we have a lead.And let me just give you two examples: One is in computer technology and information technology.That's why what's happening to some of our big companies is very disturbing and why I'm going to California this weekend to announce a new technology policy to try to revitalize this whole sector of our economy.I'll give you another example which doesn't affect New York much, but it affects our country desperately, and that is aerospace.Boeing just announced 23,000 layoffs when we know that aerospace jobs are growing in number worldwide, high-wage jobs.And we sat here for 10 years and let Europe put $26 billion into an airbus program, direct government subsidies, to throw Boeing workers, McDonnell-Douglas workers, and other aerospace workers in America out of work because we said, Well, we don't practice those kind of partnerships.So we have got to face the fact that we've taken a new direction.And finally, it means that we must reduce the Government's debt.Why? Because if the debt gets bigger and bigger and bigger, two bad things happen: Bad thing number one is the Congress spends more of your tax money every year paying interest on the debt rather than investing in your future.It's now up to 15 cents on the dollar.If we do not change present spending patterns&mdash;when you hear people oppose the program I outline, ask them what the cost of the status quo is.If we behave for 4 more years like we have for the last 12, here's what will happen: By the end of the decade, the deficit will be $650 billion a year, and we'll be spending about 22 cents of every one of your tax dollars just paying interest on the debt.We'll be spending by then, because of the growth of health care costs, about 65 cents of your tax dollars on entitlements, and being in Congress will be a matter of how you spend 5 or 6 cents on every dollar.The rest of this will be just be rubber stamped.You can just have a computer instead of Congress.I know what you're thinking.Please don't say that.I mean, it's squeezing the life out of the money you're giving up in taxes.The second reason, even more important, is the more money the Government borrows every year, the less money there is for people to borrow in the private sector and the higher the cost of the money is.Just since the election, since we made it clear that there was going to be a determined effort to lower the deficit, interest rates long-term have dropped considerably.I'll come back to this in a moment.But if you think about it, this year if we pass this budget, everybody in America who borrows long-term to finance a business, to finance a car, to finance a home, to finance credit card purchases, everybody that has access to variable interest rates will have those interest rates go down.And in my judgment, virtually everybody who has credit will save more money in lower interest costs than they will pay in higher taxes.Now, that's very, very important.Now, how are we going to do this? The first thing we have to do, and I mean the first, is to cut inessential Government spending.I've been President 4 weeks, and I've found things that I wouldn't have believed.The White House, when I became President, was running on Jimmy Carter's telephone system and Lyndon Johnson's switchboard in this&mdash;true&mdash;high-wage, this high-technology era, with a procurement system that would have broken Einstein's brain.But in 4 weeks, we have cut the White House staff by 25 percent, starting at the beginning of the next fiscal year, and reorganized the White House so it will work more efficiently; not just cut but serve better.We have authorized in this budget administrative cuts in every Government Department, totaling 14 percent over the next 4 years for a savings of $9 billion.And there have been 150 specific cuts in Government programs, including programs that help a lot of good people but that I don't think we can afford at the present level anymore, programs like the two uranium enrichment facilities we have when we now know we only need one.And I was in one congressional district where one of those two facilities are this morning.You can say these cuts are not difficult, but when you look into the eyes of people who may be personally affected by them, they are, including reductions in the interest subsidies to the Rural Electrification Authority, something that brought electricity to my relatives in my State and which is still a very major force.Things that have some good in them, but we simply can't afford them.We've cut things out that have no good purpose anymore as far as I can tell, including a whole slew of commissions.Do you remember when we had the tall ships come into New York Harbor for the Bicentennial? That was a long time ago.Remember that? There's still a bicentennial commission.It's the funniest, but not the most costly.There are a lot of others.We have cut back on programs that involve subsidizing activities more than we should.The Superfund, for example, has, in my judgment, too much contribution from the taxpayer, too little from those who are responsible for the problem, and none of the money is being spent right.So far it's all going to lawyers.It's all going to lawyers.There is a program that I think helps a lot of wonderful people.It's a subsidy to sheep growers.You laugh.I asked Senator Moynihan if anybody in New York still raised sheep.We had sheep on the farm when I was a boy, so I'm more sensitive to this than some are.But when I got to studying this, we started to subsidize the sheep growers in World War I because we needed plenty of wool for uniforms.But the program is still on the books exactly as it was, not designed to help the small farmers stay in business, necessarily, but an across-the-board subsidy of that kind.So I recommended cutting it back.All these things have constituencies.But I can tell you, we are going to have to prove that we can cut things.When Roosevelt talked about bold, persistent experimentation, you know what an experiment is in science.It is trying out a new thesis.If it works, you incorporate it.You build on it.You go on to the next experiment.If it doesn't work, you quit.Government has a one-way experiment.We're very good at starting things and absolutely terrible at stopping them.So what we're going to try to do is start some new things.I want to fully fund Head Start.I want a big, new technology initiative.I want a big, new technology issue.I want to make it possible for every student in this country to borrow the money to go to college and then pay it back on favorable terms or work it off in national service, as teachers or police officers or working with kids in trouble.But we can't do that if we keep on doing everything we used to do.We have to stop doing some things we used to do to free up some money for things we should do.And we have to cut more in the past than we're going to spend in the future, because we have to use some of that money to reduce the deficit, too.So I ask you to support that.Now, in 4 weeks we found 150 specific cuts.As I said to the Congress the other night, in all good conscience to both the Republicans and the Democrats, I've just been there 4 weeks.Some of them have been there a lot longer than I have, and if anybody's got any other ideas, I'd like to have them.I just got started.You can look forward to more.I also think as I said in the campaign that we have to raise some more money.I now believe what I said might be true in the campaign, but I didn't think it was, that we have to raise it from a broader base than just people that make over $100,000, and I want to deal with that.After the election in December, the Government increased its estimates of our deficit by about $50 billion a year over the next 4 years.Now, if I had stayed with exactly the same plan that I recommended in the campaign, the first thing my critics who now attack me for raising taxes would say is, Oh, he's going to increase the deficit.Oh, he's being too optimistic.I decided that when they revised deficit figures up one more time $50 billion a year, that somebody had to take this thing and shake it up and say, We are definitely going to have a plan of spending cuts, new investments, and revenue increases that will bring this debt down.And I plead guilty to doing that.And I think almost any of you, if you had been in my circumstance, would have done the same thing if you were thinking about what was in the long-term best interest of the country.And you can see it by how much interest rates have come down just since the election.People who control these things desperately want to believe that our Government can exercise some discipline again, that we can have some focus, that we can show some restraint as well as some activity.Now, the taxes that I propose to raise&mdash;let me just basically go through them&mdash;are essentially three.There are more minor ones, but the big-ticket items are as follows: Number one, an increase in the income tax on the top 1.2 percent of income earners; an increase in the corporate income tax on corporations that have income in excess of $10 million a year.Number two, an increase in the income subject to taxation of people who draw Social Security but also have other income in excess of $32,000 a year if they're couples, or individuals in excess of $25,000 a year.In other words, anyone who is not paying tax on Social Security now will not pay tax under my plan.That's 80 percent of the Social Security recipients.The upper 20 percent will be asked to pay taxes on a higher percentage of their income, but we will still leave enough of that income free so that almost all of them will get back what they put into the Social Security system plus interest without taxation.The rest will be subject to the income tax.I think that is fair.Since 1985&mdash;I'm very proud of this&mdash;since 1985&mdash;as an American, you should be proud of it&mdash;the people of this country over 65 have had a lower poverty rate than people under 65.That's the good news.The bad news is that one in five American kids is living in poverty.So it seems to me that this is a fair thing to do under these circumstances.And then the third thing I recommended was an energy tax that will raise $20 billion a year and will help us to clean up the environment, promote conservation, and make us more independent of foreign oil.It is a broad-based tax to try to be fair to every part of the country.And I want to deal with this because I'm in New York now.There were some who said tax carbon, that's a fancy way of saying tax coal, which is very tough on West Virginia, Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, coal States that have been very hard hit.So I said no.There were others who said put a huge tax on gasoline, which is good for city dwellers but tough on people that live in the country and that live in those big western States where they have to drive very long distances and a carpool is not an option.So we said no.And some said tax the value of energy, which sounds great, except whenever one source of energy goes up the taxes go up.So you reinforce price increases.So we decided the most environmentally responsible and regionally fair way to do it was to tax the heat content of energy, oil, gas, coal in a very modest way, and then to have an offset over the next 4 years where any disproportionate impact in the Northeast for home heating oil, and real incentives for conversion.Now finally, let me say this program exacts no new taxes for the 40-plus percent of our income tax payers whose taxable income is under $30,000; about $20 a year for people at $30,000; goes up to something between $10 and $15 a month, depending on what your purchasing habits are, for people at $40,000.Seventy percent of it comes from people whose incomes exceed $100,000.There are also some other things here I want you to know about.This program has some tax incentives, which is a fancy way for saying tax cuts for people who invest their money: for the next 2 years, an investment tax credit for all businesses in America large and small who increase their rate of investment; then after that, some tax changes asked for by the manufacturing community for bigger businesses that will always encourage investment; and, for the first time, I think, ever, a small business investment tax credit that is a permanent 7-percent investment tax credit for the 90-plus percent of our businesses that operate on $5 million or less in revenues but create most of our new jobs.This is a very significant thing that will encourage the private sector to invest in job-generating activities and very important, because in every year of the 1980's, big business lost employment and small business overcame it with more new jobs; but for the last 2 1/2 years small business has not been creating enough jobs to offset the losses in big business.So we've got to reverse that.There's one final point I want to make as strongly as I can about this.Our plan will bring the deficit down dramatically over the next 4 years.In the 4th year, it will be $140 billion a year lower than it would otherwise be.But unless we also tackle the health care crisis this year, the deficits will start going up after that no matter what we do, because the cost of health care is going to overtake every other thing in the budget and swallow it whole, and not for new health care.We will be paying more for the same health care.So there is no more urgent item on our national agenda than getting all the people involved in health care together and trying to hammer it out.I asked the First Lady, as all of you know, to head a task force on this.She is increasingly less grateful to me for having asked her to do that.And we have got to do that, or we can't turn this country's economic health around.You talk to any major manufacturer and ask them what their biggest problem is.Nine out of ten of them will tell you, my health care costs.You talk to the steel people and the auto people and ask them, and a lot of them will tell you, just paying the health care costs of our retirees.So we have to face that.Now, that's all of the bad news.Now, what's the good news? What are you going to get out of this? A half a million new jobs in the next year and a half in a job stimulus program, and a long-term program to raise our levels of investment and our quality of education and training, to be fairer to the lower income working people and create an environment that moves people from welfare to work, to have policies that really support families who are working and trying to raise children, and to have an investment program that breaks the barriers of new technologies and actually tries to create more new jobs than we are losing every year.No one can promise you, nobody, to stop anything bad from happening in this world.The world you're living in is so dynamic; there's going to be so many changes; no one can repeal the law of change.But change has been too many enemies for too many people.I seek to make change the friend of the American people.That's what this program does.It will make change our friend instead of our enemy.But we first have the courage.We must have the courage to seize control of our own destiny.So I want to say to you, just as I said to Congress the other night, I need your help.I can't do this alone.If you think there's something wrong with my program, fine.Come up with an alternative.But I promise you, the cost of the status quo is the most expensive course of all.Staying with what we've been doing is plainly unacceptable.Every American ought to be able to see that.The price is entirely too high.The price of my program is far lower with far higher results.I ask people of good will all across this country, just as I asked the Congress: If you can think of more things we can cut in spending that are really good for this economy and the American people over the long run, have at it.Let's go.I'm just getting started.I will not, I will not support any tax increase without the spending cuts.I'm not for that.I think we would also be very foolish to say that we don't need to invest more in our children and in our technology and in our economic future in putting the American people back to work.After all, the bottom line of all this is the chance that Americans need to have a dignified life.We are here in this beautiful school building today.It still looks fabulous after all these years because President Roosevelt knew it was wrong to let all those energetic, hard-working, family-oriented, God-fearing craftsmen and people who could work, sit idle month after month, year after year, when they had a contribution to make that would be good for themselves and good for the country.I ask you now to give me your support so that we can mobilize the energies of a whole generation of Americans.It will be good for you, but more important, it will be good for the country.Thank you very much.",clinton
"First of all, I want to thank you all for the introduction to your wonderful company.I want to thank Ed and Ken.We saw them last night with a number of other of the executives from Silicon Valley, people, many of them with whom I've worked for a good length of time, many of whom the Vice President's known for a long time in connection with his work on supercomputing and other issues.We came here today for two reasons, and since mostly we just want to listen to you, I'll try to state this briefly.One reason was to pick this setting to announce the implementation of the technology policy we talked about in the campaign, as an expression of what we think the National Government's role is in creating a partnership with the private sector to generate more of these kinds of companies, more technological advances to keep the United States always on the cutting edge of change and to try to make sure we'll be able to create a lot of good new jobs for the future.The second reason&mdash;can I put that down? We're not ready yet for this.The second reason I wanted to come here is, I think the Government ought to work like you do.And before that can ever happen we have to be able to get the people, the Congress, and the press, who have to interpret all this to the people, to imagine what we're talking about.I have, for example, the first State government in the country that started a total quality management program in all the departments of government, trying to figure out how we could reinvent the government.And I basically believe my job as President is to try to adjust America in good ways so that we can win in the 21st century, so that we can make change our friend and not our enemy.Ed said that you plan your new products knowing they'll be obsolete within 12 to 18 months, and you want to be able to replace them.We live in an era of constant change.And America's biggest problem, if you look at it through that lens, is that for too many people change is an enemy, not a friend.I mean, one reason you're all so happy is you found a way to make change your friend, right? Diversity is a strength, not a source of division, right? Change is a way to make money, not throw people out of work, right? If you decentralize and push decisions made down to the lowest possible level, you enable every employee to live up to the fullest of their ability.By giving them a 6-week break every 4 years, you don't force them to make these sharp divisions between your work life and your private life.It's sort of a seamless web.These are things we need to learn in America and we need to incorporate even into more traditional workplaces.So I'd like to start&mdash;we'll talk about the technology policy later, and the Vice President, who had done so much work, will talk a lot about the details at the end of this meeting.But I just want to start by telling you that one of our missions&mdash;in order to make this whole thing work we're going to have to make the Government work differently.Example: We cut the White House staff by 25 percent to set a standard for cutting inessential spending in the Government.But the work load of the White House is way up.We're getting all-time record telephone calls and letters coming in, and we have to serve our customers, too.Our customers are the people that put us there, and if they have to wait 3 months for an answer to a letter, that's not service.But when we took office, I walked into the Oval Office&mdash;it's supposed to be the nerve center of the United States&mdash;and we found Jimmy Carter's telephone system.No speaker phone, no conference calls, but anybody in the office could punch the lighted button and listen to the President talk, so that I could have the conference call I didn't want but not the one I did.Literally, when a phone would come and they'd say, I want to talk to the Vice President's office, they would pick up a little cord and push it into a little hole.And all the offices were organized in little closed boxes, just the opposite of what you see.In our campaign, however, we ran an organization in the Presidential campaign that was very much like this.Most decisions were made in a great big room in morning meetings that we had our senior staff in, but any 20-year-old volunteer who bad a good idea could walk right in and say, Here's my idea.Some of them were very good, and we incorporated them.And we had a man named Ellis Mottur who helped us to put together our technology policy.He was one of our senior citizens; he was in his fifties.And he said, I've been writing about high-performance work organizations all my life.And this is the first one I've ever worked in, and it has no organizational chart.I can't figure out what it looks like on paper, but it works.The Vice President was making fun of me when we were getting ready for the speech I gave Wednesday night to the Congress; it was like making sausage.People were running in and out saying, Put this in, and take this out.You know, it worked.So I want to hear from you, but I want you to know that we have hired a person at the Office of Management and Budget who has done a lot of work in creating new businesses and turning businesses around, to run the management part of that.We're trying to review all these indictments that have been issued over the last several years about the way the Federal Government is rim.But I want you to know that I think a major part of my mission is to literally change the way the National Government works, spends your tax dollars, so that we can invest more and consume less and look toward the future.And that literally will require rethinking everything about the way the Government operates.The Government operates so much to keep bad things from happening that there's very little energy left in some places to make good things happen.If you spend all your time trying to make sure nothing bad happens, there's very little time and money and human energy left to make good things happen.We're going to try to pare away a lot of that bureaucracy and speed up the decision-making process and modernize it.And I know a lot of you can help.Technology is a part of that, but so is organization and empowerment, which is something you've taught us again today.And I thank you very much.We want to do a question and answer now, and then the Vice President is going to talk in more detail about our technology policy later.But that's what we and Ed agreed to do.So I wonder if any of you have a question you want to ask us or a comment you want to make.Yes, go ahead.Is part of your agenda to review the export control system, and can industry count on export regulations that will keep pace with technology advances in our changing world? The Vice President.Let me start off on that.As you may know, the President appointed as the Deputy Secretary of Commerce John Rollwagen, who was the CEO at Cray.And he and Ron Brown, the Secretary of Commerce, have been reviewing a lot of procedures for stimulating U.S.exports around the world.And we're going to be a very export-oriented administration.However, we are also going to keep a close eye on the legitimate concerns that have in the past limited the free export of some technologies that can make a dramatic difference in the ability of a Qadhafi or a Saddam Hussein to develop nuclear weapons or ICBM's.Now, in some cases in the past, these legitimate concerns have been interpreted and implemented in a way that has frustrated American business unnecessarily.There are, for example, some software packages that are available off the shelf in stores here that are nevertheless prohibited from being exported.And sometimes that's a little bit unrealistic.On the other hand, there are some in business who are understandably so anxious to find new customers that they will not necessarily pay as much attention as they should to what the customer might use this new capacity for.And that's a legitimate role for Government, to say, hold on, the world will be a much more dangerous place if we have 15 or 20 nuclear powers instead of 5 or 6, and if they have ICBM's and so forth.So it's a balance that has to be struck very carefully.And we're going to have a tough nonproliferation strategy while we promote more exports.If I might just add to that, the short answer to your question, of course, is yes, we're going to review this.And let me give you one example: Ken told me last night at dinner, he said, If we export substantially the same product to the same person, if we have to get one permit to do it, we'll have to get a permit every time we want to do the same thing, over and over again.They always give it to us, but we have to wait 6 months, and it puts us behind the competitive arc.Now, that's something that ought to be changed, and we'll try to change that.We also know that some of our export controls, rules and regulations, are a function of the realities of the cold war which aren't there anymore.But what the Vice President was trying to say, and he said so well&mdash;I just want to reemphasize&mdash;our biggest security problem in the future may well be the proliferation of nuclear and nonnuclear, like biological and chemical, weapons of mass destruction to small, by our standards, countries with militant governments who may not care what the damage to their own people could be.So that's something we have to watch very closely.But apart from that, we want to move this much more quickly, and we'll try to slash a lot of the time delays where we ought to be doing these things.President, Mr.Vice President, you've seen scientific visualization in practice here.As a company we're also very interested in ongoing research in high-performance computing and scientific visualization.Can we expect to see a change in the national scientific agenda that includes scientific visualization? Right now I don't see the scientific visualization as being represented, for example, on the FCCSET committee.The Vice President.It is a good question.One of the people who flew out here with us for this event and for the release of the technology policy in just a few minutes is Dr.Jack Gibbons, who is in the back of the room, the President's science adviser and head of the Office of Science and Technology Policy.And he will be in charge of the FCCSET process.That's an acronym that&mdash;what does it stand for, Jack&mdash;the Federal Coordinating Council on Science and Engin&mdash;what is it? Jack Gibbons.Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering, and Technology.The Vice President.Right.And visualization will play a key role in the deliberations of the FCCSET.We were actually, believe it or not, talking about this a little bit with Dr.Gibbons on the way over here.I had hearings one time where a scientist used sort of technical terms that he then explained.It made an impression on me.He said, If you tried to describe the human mind in terms applicable to a computer, you'd say we have a low bit rate but high resolution.Meaning&mdash;this is one of the few audiences I can use that line with.When we try to absorb information bit by bit, we don't have a huge capacity to do it.That's why the telephone company, after extensive studies, decided that seven numbers were the most that we could keep in short-term memory.And then they added three more.We can all recognize the Milky Way, for example, even though there are trillions of points of light, stars, and so forth.And so the idea of incorporating visualization as a key component of this strategy is one that we recognize as very important, and we're going to pursue it.Let me just add one thing to that.First of all, I told the crowd last night that the Vice President was the only person ever to hold national office in America who knew what the gestalt of the gigabit is.They're going to make time of us for being policy wonks.This whole visualization movement that you have been a part of in your line of work is going to merge in a very short time with the whole business in traditional education theory called applied academics.We're now finding, with just sort of basic computer work in the elementary schools of our country, dramatic differences in learning curves among people who can see the work they're doing as opposed to people who are supposed to read it.And we're now finding that the IQ's of young people who might take a vocational track in school may not be all that different from kids that would stay in a traditional academic track and wind up at Stanford, but their learning patterns are dramatically different.And there are some people&mdash;this is a huge new discovery, basically, that's coming into the whole business of traditional educational theory.So someday what you're doing here will revolutionize the basic teaching in our schools, starting at kindergarten and going forward, so that the world of work and the world of education will begin to be merged backwards all the way to the beginning.And it's going to be, I think, the most important thing we've ever done and very important for proving that in a diverse population all people can reach very high levels of achievement.Ed McCracken.The President and Vice President have also come here today to present a new national technology policy for the country.Do you want to&mdash; We'll answer some more questions.I'm going to forego my time and just let him announce the policy, so we can hear some more questions.Got to give the man equal time, I know.I really see a possibility in what you stand for, and I really think this is why you were elected, that you say you stand for change.You said that during your campaign.I think the company believed that.They're counting on you&mdash;I'm nervous&mdash;and I just want to say we're really, as a country, behind you.I think that's why the statistics are saying that we're willing to have our taxes increased; we're willing to have cuts, because you say you're really going to do it this time and decrease the deficit.I hope to God that you do.We need it not just for this present time, but by your actually fulfilling on this it will make a major change in how we feel about Government; that when Government says they're going to make a difference and they really come through, it will make a huge impact for the future.And I'm really personally behind you all the way.I wish I'd voted for you.Thank you.I really appreciate that.Let me make one comment in response, if I might.I think it's important, and you can help others understand this, to understand why we have to reduce the deficit, which is something that is normally not done when unemployment is high.And unemployment is still too high.Even though we're in an economic recovery, most of our recovery is due to higher productivity from firms that, in turn, this time are not hiring new people for all kinds of reasons.And we have to reduce the deficit for two reasons: Number one, we're already spending 15 percent of your tax money just to pay interest on past debt.If we don't change present patterns, we'll be over 20 cents by the year 2000.That's money we should be spending on education and technology in the future.Number two, the more money we take out of the pool of funds for borrowing, the more expensive it is for companies like this and other companies that have to go into the markets and borrow to borrow.Just since the election, since we made it clear we were going to try to bring the deficit down, long-term interest rates have dropped seven-tenths of one percent.That is a huge savings for everybody that is going to borrow money or that has a variable interest rate on a loan, whether it's a home mortgage or a business loan or a car loan or whatever.That's important.The second thing we're trying to do that I know you will also appreciate is to shift the balance of the money we do spend more away from consumption toward investment, investments in education, technology, environmental cleanup, and converting from a defense to a domestic economy.One of the bizarre things that happened to us in the eighties is that we increased the deficit first through defense expenses and then through exploding health care costs and increasing interest payments.But we reduced our investments in the future and the things that make us richer.So those are the changes we're trying to effect.Let me just make one other point.I will not support raising anybody's taxes unless budget cuts also pass.Approximately 50 percent of our revenues come internationally, including a substantial market in Japan.What types of programs does your administration plan to help the high-growth companies of the nineties sell to the international markets? Two things.First of all, we intend to try to open new markets and new markets in our region.That is, to keep America growing, I believe high-growth companies are going to have to sell south of the border more.And to do that we have to negotiate trade agreements that will help to raise incomes in those countries even as we are growing.That's why I support, with some extra agreements, the NAFTA agreement and why I hope we can have an agreement with Chile and hope we can have an agreement with other countries like Argentina that are making a serious effort to build market economies: because we want to build new markets for all of you.With Japan, I think what we have to do is to try to continue to help more companies figure out how to do business there and keep pushing them to open their markets.I don't want to close American markets to Japanese products, but it is the only nation with which we have a persistent and unchanging structural deficit.The product deficit with Japan is not $43 billion, which is our overall trade deficit, it is actually about $60 billion in product, in manufactured production.So we've got a lot of problems we have to work out there.With Europe, we sometimes are in surplus; we're sometimes in deficit.But it's a floating thing, so it's more or less in balance.With developing nations like Taiwan and Korea, those countries had big surpluses with us, but as they became richer they brought them down, so that we're more or less in balance.We have our biggest trade relationship with Canada, and we're more or less in balance.So we have to work on this Japanese issue while trying to help more of you get involved.Let me make one final comment on that.I think we should devote more Government resources to helping small and medium-size companies figure out how to trade, because that's what the Germans do with such great success and why they're one of the great exporters of the world.They don't waste a lot of money on the real big companies that have already figured it out, but they have extra efforts for small and medium-size companies to get them to think global from the beginning of their endeavors.And I think we're going to have to do more of that.Your economic plan does a great job of promoting R&D investment.Are there any elements that are specifically targeted to promote the application of Silicon Graphics technology to environmental-friendly initiatives such as the electric car or the mag-lev train? I think I should let the Vice President answer that since it's his consuming passion.And if I do it, his book sales will go up again.One is the environment needs it.Secondly, we think it's wonderful economics, because I believe that all these environmental opportunities that are out there for us represent a major chunk of what people who used to be involved in defense technologies could be doing in the future if we're going to maintain a high wage base in America.So I'd like for the Vice President to talk a little about the specifics that we're working on.The Vice President.That goal is integrated into the technology plan as one of our key objectives.The Japanese and the Germans are now openly saying that the biggest new market in the history of world business is the market for the new products, technologies, and processes that foster economic progress without environmental destruction.Some have compared the drive for environmental efficiency to the movement for quality control and the quality revolution in the sixties and seventies.At that time, you know, many companies in the United States felt that the existing level of product quality was more or less ordained by the forces of supply and demand and it couldn't be improved without taking it out of the bottom line.But the Japanese, taking us innovations from Dr.Deming and others, began to introduce a new theory of product quality and simultaneously improved quality, profits, wages, and productivity.The environmental challenge now presents us with the same opportunity.By introducing new attention to environmental efficiency at every step along the way, we can simultaneously reduce the impact of all our processes on the environment, improve environmental efficiency, and improve productivity at the same time.We need to set clear, specific goals in the technology policy, in the economic plan.And you know, both the stimulus package and the investment package focus a great deal on environmental cleanup and environmental innovation.And whereas we've talked a lot about roads and bridges in the past, and they're a big part of this plan also, we're putting relatively more emphasis as well on water lines and sewer lines and water treatment plants and renovating the facilities in the national parks and cleaning up trails, taking kids from inner cities and putting them to work cleaning up trails in national parks, for example, as part of the summer jobs program.So you'll find when you look at both the technology plan and the economic plan an enormous emphasis on the environment.Go ahead, sir.They say we have to quit in a minute.I'll take one more question after this.President, Mr.Vice President, the news stories and articles that the public has access to regarding the budget and the economy are very often confusing and contradictory.I might explain it in the same terms that you used: The information is delivered low bit rate, but the problem is huge and requires the highres view.So my question is: I wonder if you're using Lyndon Johnson's computer to analyze the budget and the economy, or whether or not you might be open to using some of the things you've seen here to get the bigger picture and also communicate that to us? Thank you.There are two things I'd like to respond to on that, and I'd like to invite you to help.Senator Moynihan and I went to Franklin Roosevelt's home in Hyde Park, New York, just a couple of days ago.You may have seen the press on it.And on the way back he said to me that the challenges that we face are different from those that Roosevelt faced but just as profound.Unemployment was higher and America was more devastated when he took office, he said, but everybody knew what the problem was.Therefore, he bad a lot of leeway working with the Congress in the beginning to work toward a solution.Now, he said, we are facing severe challenges to a century of economic leadership, and it's not clear to every American exactly what the dimensions of the problem are.The capacity you have to help me help the American people conceptualize this is quite significant: showing the trends in the deficit, showing the trends in the investment, showing how the money is spent now and bow we propose to spend it.The second big problem we have you can see if you look at the front page of USA Today today, which shows a traditional analysis, yesterday's analysis&mdash;of the business section&mdash;of the economic program.It basically says, Oh, it will bring unemployment down a little and it will increase economic growth a little if we do this, but not all that much.Now, why is that? That's because traditional economic analysis says that the only way the Government can ever help the economy grow is by spending more money and taxing less.In other words, traditional Keynesian economies: Run a bigger deficit.But we can't do that.The deficit's already so big, I can't run the risk to the long-term stability of this country by going in and doing that.This analysis doesn't really make a distinction between investment and consumption, doesn't take any account of what we might do with a technology policy or a trade policy to make the economy grow faster, has no way of factoring in what other good things could happen in the private market if you brought long-term interest rates down through the deficit.So you could also help us to reconceptualize this.A lot of the models that dominate policy-making are yesterday's models, too.I'll give you just one example.The Japanese had a deficit about as big as ours, and they were increasing spending at 19 percent a year, government spending, back in the early seventies when the oil prices went way up and they were more energy-dependent than we were on foreign oil.And they just decided they had to change it, but they couldn't stop investing.So they had a budget which drew a big distinction, a literal distinction, legal distinction, between investment and consumption, and they embarked on a 10 or 11 year effort to bring the budget into balance.And during that time they increased investment and lowered unemployment and increased growth through the right kind of spending and investment.And I want to lead in, if I might, and ask the Vice President before we go to give you some of the specifics of this technology policy, by making one more pitch to you about this whole economic plan.This plan has 150 specific budget cuts.And I'm welcome to more.I told the Republican leadership if they had more budget cuts that didn't compromise our economy, if they helped us, I would be glad to embrace them.I'm not hung up about that.But I did pretty good in 4 weeks to find 150, and I'll try to find some more on my own.It also has the revenue increases that you know about.It also bas some spending increases, and there will be debate about that.There will be people who say, Well, just don't spend this new money.Don't immunize all the kids.Don't fully fund Head Start.Don't pay for this technology policy.Don't invest in all these environmental cleanup things, and that way you won't have to raise taxes so much.The problem is, if you look at the historic spending trends, we are too low on investment and too high on the deficit, and both are problems.And secondly, we've got to have some of these economic cooperations in order to move the economy forward.So I want you to listen to what the Vice President says in that context.Because what you will hear is, we don't need to do what we think we should do in this area.If we don't, I think we'll be out of competition.People like you will do fine because you've got a good company here, but the country as a whole will fall behind.And you can help on both those points.So would you proceed?",clinton
"Thank you very much, Chairman Shrontz, Speaker Foley, Senator Murray, Governor Lowrey, and Member of the congressional delegation, and most of all to the men and women of Boeing.I have looked forward to coming here for a long time.And I guess what I ought to begin by saying is, thank you for Air Force One.You know, everywhere I go in that airplane, I am the second most important celebrity.People really just want to see the plane.You should also know that it enables me on these flights across the country and going across the world to continue to work with a full staff almost as if I had never left the office.And it is a real tribute to all of you, and a magnificent set of planes&mdash;you know, there are two of them.I know a lot of you made them both, so you know that.But I'm grateful to you for that.I also think you may know, but I should say that after this meeting with you, I'm going to go to another room and meet with a lot of folks who have come here to meet with me and with our national leaders about the health of the airline industry, about the commercial airline companies themselves, and about the airline manufacturers, the chief of which obviously is Boeing, but including other companies as well.So when I leave you, I'm going to go and meet with them for about an hour to talk about where we're going from here.I want to begin by saying that there's an interesting book, which has been written by a very famous economics writer named Lester Thurow called Head to Head.And Thurow's argument in this book is&mdash;it affects your lives, so I'm going to tell you about it&mdash;his argument is that there may be a limited number of highway jobs available over the next 20 years, and that seven major technologies will provide most of the growth in those jobs, a lot of them are, as you might suspect, in the computer and electronics field.I was just down in Silicon Valley before I came here at a magnificent little company named Silicon Graphics that does some work for you, to talk about a technology policy to accelerate the growth in areas where we're doing well.But one of those seven areas is aeronautics and the manufacturer of airplanes and in the provision of airline services to commercial travelers.It is indeed ironic that the United States which, for so long has led the world in the production of airplanes and in the development of sophisticated consumer-oriented services through commercial carriers, has had 3 years in which more money has been lost than was made in the previous history of the airline industry.And I can tell you from my study, very little of that is your fault.A lot of it has to do with the fact that other nations follow targeted strategies of partnerships to pierce markets which you had dominated under a free market system but with which you could not compete in Europe's subsidized airbus to the tune of $26 billion, for example.I want to talk to you today about the whole economic plan, the tough parts as well as the good parts.But I want you to know that one big part of my economic strategy is to try to identify all those areas that can really provide high-wage, high-growth futures for Americans and their families and make sure that we are there, competing and winning, that people have a chance to work and make a living.And we can't begin by giving up on the production of aircraft, which is what we have come dangerously close to doing by sitting by and letting our competitors do things that we did not do to meet the competition.And I believe we can do better.I hope this meeting today is the first step in that regard.I also want to say a special word of appreciation to the Speaker and to the leaders of Congress.In the next few days, the Congress will produce a bill establishing a national commission on the condition of the airlines industries in America; one that will require the House and the Senate to appoint five members each and the President to appoint five members; and unlike a lot of commissions, will require them to report back within 90 days with a tight time table with a specific set of recommendations to take to the country to preserve and promote the economic health of the industry that you've done so much to make the world's best.The second thing I want to say is that my trade ambassador, Mickey Kantor, will be closely monitoring the agreement which was made finally last year with regard to limiting European subsidies to airbus to allow a level playing field.We'll be seeking tough new discipline on those subsidies, both in our attempts to get an agreement on the general agreement on trade, as well as the specific aircraft code.You know, I've seen these agreements made for years.I've seen people promise us they'd do this, that, and the other thing, and then nothing ever happens.And I think you and I know deep in our heart that most of these layoffs&mdash;maybe not all, because the airline industry itself has problems which are bleeding back on to you, the commercial carriers&mdash;but a lot of these layoffs would not have been announced had it not been for the $26 billion that the United States sat by and let Europe plow into airbus over the last several years.So we're going to try to change the rules of the game.I can't promise you overnight miracles.We didn't get into this fix overnight.But I can say that we have to turn the direction of this country around, and we need a commitment, not to shield ourselves from competition but to reward ourselves when we fairly compete and win.We need a commitment to meet the competition around the world in a global economy in which the things that really pay off are high levels of education and skills, high levels of investment in appropriate technologies, a very close amount of cooperation within each workplace among workers and between workers and management, and in the national sense bet-ween Government and business and labor.The countries which do that win; those which don't are punished.And we can no longer afford to wait for 10 years while someone does something to us that we do not respond to.And I want to turn that around, not with overnight miracles but with a disciplined approach to put the American people and their economic future first in the policy-making of the United States Government.It's your country, and I'm doing my best to give it back to you.I ask each of you to express to your Congressmen and your Senators support for the national economic plan which I announced to the Congress on last Wednesday.It is a plan which seeks to do two things that we've never done in the history of America before at the same time.It seeks to reduce this awful Government debt and to increase investment in our future at the same time.And it's hard to cut your debts and increase your investment at the same time.It's hard if you're Boeing.It's hard if you're the United States Government.But we have no choice, because in the last 12 years, we have quadrupled the debt of the Government, which means we're spending 15 cents of every dollar you give us in taxes right now just paying interest on yesterday's debt, 15 cents of every dollar you pay in taxes that we can't put into an investment incentive for an airline company, for an education for your children, for better health care for America.It also means we're taking so much money out of the pool of money available that if Boeing or a small business or somebody wanting to buy a car or a home has to borrow money, their interest rates are higher than they otherwise would be.So we've got to bring the debt down, but we also have to look over the last 12 years.Your country has reduced its investment while our competitors have increased their investments in critical areas of education and training and new technologies and in building the kinds of things that put people to work and make a country rich.So to do it, we have to cut spending, raise some more tax money, and target some new investments, not in consuming things but in things that will build jobs and incomes in the years ahead.I have offered the Congress in good faith an honest spending cut program with 150 specific reductions in spending cuts, including a 25 percent cut in my own staff, the biggest, as far as I can tell, in the history of the Republic, certainly in the 20th century, and a $9 billion cut in the administrative costs to the Federal Government, and asking the Federal employees who work for you to have a pay freeze this year and to have their pay go up at less than the rate of inflation for the next 3 years, which will save that much again.We are cutting spending where we can.I have also made it clear that I don't want to raise one penny of tax dollars until I know those cuts are in effect.We shouldn't raise money until we cut spending.We should do them together.Seventy percent of the burden of this tax program will fall on people whose taxable income, not net income, taxable income is above $100,000.But some of it will fall on people with incomes of between $30,000 and $100,000, and I want to level with you about that.For years there have been those who say we ought to reduce the deficit by raising the gas tax a whole lot.That's fine if you live in the city and ride mass transit to work.It's not so good if you live in the country and drive yourself to work.There are a lot of working people in America today that have no access to mass transit and can't carpool; so I rejected a big gas tax.Then there were people who said, Well, the best thing to do environmentally is to tax carbon.That's a funny way of saying coal.The problem with that is, there's a lot of people just like you in Pennsylvania and West Virginia and places like that who make their livings in and around the coal mines.And it didn't seem fair to me to put such a burden on them that they would be in trouble.So we decided to pick what seems to be the environmentally best thing that doesn't hurt so many people, and that is a tax on the energy capacity of all forms of fuel, of gas and oil and coal, called a BTU tax, which amounts to about 2 cents on a gallon of gasoline, and will cost the average family with an income of $50,000 about 15 bucks a month at the outside if they have a family of four and drive a lot.And I think that is a fair way to go.I didn't want to even do that, but after the election I was told that the Government deficit was going to be about $50 billion a year bigger than we had been told before the election.And so my choice was not to ask for an additional contribution from the middle class, let the deficit get out of hand, and have your interest rates go up, or try to deal with this debt and try to face the fact that we need to invest some more money too.I hope you'll support that.But I also hope you will support spending some more money in the areas that will create jobs.And let me just mention two or three.This plan contains tax incentives to business and direct investments in things like roads and environmental cleanup and airport construction that will create a half a million jobs in the next year and a ball.This plan contains $8 billion in new investments in aeronautics, in technology, in research and development, the development of new products over the next 5 years.It contains a major new general technology initiative that the Vice President and I announced today in Silicon Valley to create high-wage jobs.It contains $9 billion in new investments in high-tech products all across the Government, including the attempt to develop an environmentally clean ear and new high speed rail technology that could dramatically alter the economies of living on the Pacific Rim of our country.It contains new incentives to businesses to create jobs and especially to small business.Let me tell you that all the big companies in the country together reduced jobs all during the 1980's, but little companies created more jobs than big companies lost until about 2 years ago when the cost of health care, the unavailability of credit, and the decline of the economy stopped small business in its tracks.So we have to not only help big manufacturing operations; we've got to have a climate where people can start small businesses and keep them going.Because we know that even if we do very well in the aerospace industry, for example, there will be other very big companies that will have to downsize and restructure.And we've got to do something for small business to try to help them to go and to grow.These things are very important.And let me say one other thing that affects Boeing, at least a little bit, and that is we propose to put a lot more money into the space program, but to restructure it so that we not only have a space station but we also have a lot of new investments in other kinds of aeronautics research that will generate even more jobs in America in the years ahead.And we've proposed to spend more money on domestic research and development than we reduce in defense research and development.These are the things that made your company great, and these are the kinds of things that will make America great again.And so I ask you to support not just the spending cuts, the revenue increases, and the deficit reduction but also these very targeted investments in our future.I also ask you to support immunizing every child before the age of 2 in America, for a change, Head Start for the kids that need it, and making college loans available to all middle class, as well as low-income people, and letting them pay those loans off as a percentage of their income.Now, a lot of people will say&mdash;there's a lot of ways you can debate this&mdash;a lot of people will say, I didn't cut spending enough.To them, I say give me more spending cuts.I've just been there 4 weeks, and I'm sure there are more, and I'll find more.Then there will be those that say we cut too much.Some will say we didn't raise enough money.Some will say we've raised too much.And then some will say you shouldn't spend any new money.But remember what I said: A country now is like a big company in the global economy.If you don't invest in the right things, you don't grow.So we not only have to reduce this deficit; we've got to turn our spending priorities on their head.We've got to invest more and consume less so the country can grow, just like you want this company to grow.I believe with all my heart that the years ahead can still be the best years this country ever had.But you know what you're going through now.Just look at it.We are living in a world where change is the law of life, where the average 18-year-old will change work eight times in a lifetime.And we will be judged harshly by our children if we permit the kinds of things to go on that are happening today, which make change our enemy and not our friend.My whole goal in this economic program is to try to change the priorities of this country so people can pursue what the Founding Fathers wanted, life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, by making change our friend.I can't promise you and no politician can, to repeal the laws of global competition.I can't promise you that you won't have to work not only harder but smarter than ever before.Nobody can do that.But I think you know that your Government has been inadequate to the task of preparing you to win if you play by the rules, if you do your part, if you're highly productive.That's my job.That's what this plan's designed to do.I hope you will support it.I think it will secure the American dream for you and your children.I want to say two things.First of all, it was very diplomatic of you not to give me a bigger shirt than you gave Vice President Gore.",clinton
"I would like to thank Frank Shrontz and the good people at Boeing for hosting representatives of the major airline companies in the United States, as well as manufacturers of airplanes and airplane engines, along with the Secretary of Transportation, the Speaker of the House, and the distinguished Members of the Washington congressional delegation along with the Governor of this State.We have had a very good meeting about the problems of the manufacturers of airlines and the airline companies themselves, airplanes and airline companies.We talked a lot about the proposal now in the Congress, which is soon to be passed, to create a national commission to ensure a strong, competitive airline industry.That commission will require five appointments from the House, five appointments from the Senate, and five appointments from the President.I assured the representatives here, as did the Speaker, that we had no desire other than to find the 15 best people in America immediately to work on this issue, without regard to party or region.We just want to work together to appoint people who will come back within 90 days and give us some concrete suggestions to revitalize this very important part of our economic future.I thought it was a terrific meeting.We went around the table.Everyone who was at the meeting made a very constructive set of comments about what they thought we ought to do.And I look forward to the legislation passing, to signing it, and to immediately making the appointments and to going to work.President, that will mean for the worker who is laid off here? What will be the direct&mdash; Well, if we do a good job, we'll be able to find more business and bring some of them back to work.That's what we want to do.I'd like to ask the Speaker and the Secretary and Mr.President, are we going to airdrop supplies in to the besieged people in Bosnia? It's a possibility.I want to wait a couple of more days before I announce a policy on it.President, you said in your speech that you wanted spending cuts first and then invest in programs you call investments.Given that your spokes-people had said you're going to pass an authorization for short-term stimulus spending and that the rest of the package has come down the line, and given that most of the spending comes in the early years and the taxes would come in the out-years, in what sense do you want the spending cuts first? Well, I want an omnibus program passed which has all the spending cuts mandated along with the tax increases.I don't want to raise taxes and then sit around waiting to see whether the spending cuts are going to be enacted.I think that we ought to pass a package which includes the spending cuts at the same time we raise revenues.What I seek to do, number one, is to review it as to its adequacy and, number two, to make sure it's enforced.But I think we made a huge mistake permitting it to happen with no response.And I hope that it's not too late to have an appropriate response to maintain our position in this global marketplace.U.S.President? No, not necessarily.I think we need a different trade policy.Let me say that the linchpin of our policy still must be to expand trade.A wealthy country cannot grow wealthier by hunkering down within its own borders.We have to be a great trading nation, and we have to help other nations to grow wealthier in order for them to buy more of our products.So our goal still has to be to expand trade.But we no longer have the luxury, with other nations having grown so much more rapidly than we for 20 years, other nations being about as wealthy as we are&mdash;we no longer have the luxury of being the only country in the world that can ignore certain problems in terms of trade fairness that other countries don't ignore.We have to make sure that we are treated in these market-opening measures with the requisite amount of fairness.And so I think we may have a timber trade policy in some respects than we've had in the past, but our allies will be under no illusions.I do not want a protectionist trade policy; I want to expand trade.But I want to do it in ways that preserves America as a high-wage country.Otherwise, we won't be very good trading partners for a lot of these nations over the long run.Thank you very much.",clinton
"Thank you very much.Chairman Gorr, President Lesher, Vice Chairman Marcil, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for that warm welcome.And I welcome you to your Nation's Capital and to this magnificent old hall.I was glad to be here early enough to hear at least some of the Marine Band warming you up.That should put us all in a better frame of mind.I thank you all for your concern for your country and for the contribution you make every year and every day to make America work.I want to say a special word of appreciation for the people from my native State who even hung a sign up there so I could find them.As you know, if you've been following the news, I have been out on the road discussing with the American people the economic plan I have presented to the Congress.Yesterday I had a particularly amazing day, seeing everything that is best about our economy and some of the most profound challenges we face.I began at an interesting firm called Silicon Graphics in California's Silicon Valley, where I spent a goodly amount of time visiting with the employees and watching what they do.The Vice President and I went there to outline our technology policy.But afterward we just talked to the employees and listened to them.I was amazed to see that this company, as so many others in this country, has really succeeded in making the changes going on in our world friendly to the company, its employees, its owners, and its customer's, not the enemy.As I have said so many times across this country, I think one of my primary jobs as President now is to try to figure out a way to make these turning changes in the global environment our friend and not our enemy.Silicon Graphics have unleashed the creative energy of their most talented people.They've made a strength of the diversity that is so prominent throughout the State of California.They reduced bureaucracy to make it virtually nonexistent, pushed decisions down to the lowest level, and succeeded in creating products that are displaced every 12 to 18 months with their own products.Then I flew up to Washington to meet with the employees at the Boeing Corporation, our Nation's largest exporter, a company that, as you know, is in some trouble now.It just announced 23,000 layoffs.And after I met with several thousand of the employees there, I had an hour private meeting with the heads of all the major American airplane companies: with Boeing, then with McDonnell-Douglas, with Pratt-Whitney, those who manufacture the airplanes and the component parts that are an important part of our economy.They're facing some very tough competition.They have some structural problems in the market here, and I think have been subjected to some fairly unfair competition abroad, principally from airbus, a consortium of European efforts that has benefited from $26 billion in direct Government subsidies in the last year few years.I spent a lot of my adult life dealing with large organizations in times of challenge and change.I had the great privilege to be Governor of my State for a dozen years.And I have acquired an enormous respect for people in the private sector and what they've had to cope with in this country over the last 12 to 15 years, some of you over the last 20 years, as we have moved inexorably into a very different global economy.I came here today to ask for your support for my economic plan to take this country in a new direction because I believe it will make business more competitive and workers more productive and will help us to deal with some of the principal problems that we have faced over the last several years: high levels of unemployment periodically, stagnant wages among workers, lower levels of overall productivity than many of our major competitors.In the news today, there are things which are good news.We know that in the last quarter, American productivity jumped to almost a 20-year high as more and more American businesses have come to grips with the challenges they face.We know that the housing markets are beginning to pick up, and that's good news.We know that in the last 2 months of the last quarter, consumer confidence took a big jump, and that's good news.But we also know that there are still very serious problems in this economy with creating new jobs, serious problems with stagnant incomes, and enormous problems that have led to dampening the growth of new jobs in the small business sector.The restructuring of big business, which has been going on now for more than a decade, led to a reduction in employment in every year of the 1980's in larger businesses.But in most of that decade, the reduction in employment in big business was more than offset by the creation of new jobs in small businesses.In the last couple of years, that trend has not been able to continue.There are lots of reasons why.Clearly, the exploding cost of health care is one.The credit crunch that exists in much of our country is another, and we're trying to address that.And there are many other reasons.But it is plain that the lack of a clear national economic strategy to deal with our long-term problems has played a central role.My goal in this economic program is to follow a strategy which will, short- and long-term, increase jobs, increase incomes, and increase productivity.That means, in my judgment, we have to increase investment, both public and private; we have to do more to educate and train our people so that they can produce at high levels; we have to take far better advantage of technology in the world, especially in the commercial sector.In the 1980's, the most successful industrial strategy we had was our defense budget which kept our lead in international defense technologies while we were losing our lead in many commercial technologies.We have to have a strategy for preserving our environment that makes that an engine of economic growth, not a burden on business and a drag on the economy.We have to reduce our inordinate Government deficit.We bare to deal with the health care crisis.And we have to change the way Government operates and relates to the private sector in very fundamental ways.There bas not been a serious reexamination of the structure, the role, and the function of the Federal Government in some sort of comprehensive way in a generation.And because we have guaranteed claim on revenues and guaranteed claim on some customers, we have not been under the same pressures that many of you have to undergo, the kind of searching reexamination that the international economy has imposed on all of you.And I am committed to doing that.I ask you before we get into the details to look at just two things: First of all, if we do not think to change the fundamental pattern of the way your National Government works, if we just keep on doing what we've been doing and argue around the edges, the Republicans winning a little here, the Democrats winning a little there, everybody chipping around, but basically we keep on the same course, here is what will happen.By the end of the decade the annual deficit will be $653 billion.About 22 cents of every dollar you pay to the United States Government will go to pay interest on past debt.We'll be up to about 60 cents on entitlements by then because of the exploding cost of health care and more people retiring.We will be spending a certain amount of money that we have to spend on the national defense, and people in the Congress will come to this city having made great campaign commitments to all of you out in the country and without regard to their party, they'll be arguing over how they're going to spend 3 or 4 cents on the dollar because we will be paralyzed in the expenditure of the public money, and we'll have less money to spend on investment in our future.We'll be spending 20 percent of the gross national product on health care.And no other country, if present trends continue, will be above 10, which means every productive enterprise in the country will be spotting its international competitors 10 cents on the dollar in health care alone.If we continue the present patterns, that is what we have to look forward to.We have no alternative but to change.We should begin with a program that increases public investment in technology and education and in people and bring this deficit down at the same time.That's hard to do.This country has never tried to do that before.We've had times past when times were good and the deficit was brought down.And in times past when things were tough, the deficit has been increased to increase investment.Our Nation has never before tried to increase investment and reduce the debt at the same time.It is not easy to do.I have offered a plan to do that that cuts spending with real specific cuts, not rhetoric about overall caps; with tax increases that I believe are progressive, although none are free of pain; and with targeted, specific investments to grow this economy.Now, already we're beginning to see some impact.Just since the election, since the Secretary of the Treasury and other people on our economic team and the President have been able to send clear signals to the market that we are going to bring down this deficit, there has been a seven-tenths of one percent drop in long-term interest rates.Just yesterday, due to increased confidence in the plan in the bond market, long-term interest rates fell to a 16-year low.As a result, over the last several days mortgage rates have begun another significant decline.The serious drop in interest rates is already providing a major stimulus to economic growth and major savings to millions of American families.As interest rates fall more people will be able to save money on business loans, home loans, car loans, credit card transactions; all these things will free up cash to get the economy moving again.If we do it right and deliberately, the vast majority of Americans will save more money on lower interest rates than they will pay in the higher energy tax.Many businesses will save more money on lower interest rates than they will pay in the other tax increases.By increasing the pool of available investments through debt reduction, we can free up tax money away from interest on the debt to invest in education in our future, and we can free up major sources of funds in the private sector.We have to do this together.The reason the debt portion of the package is important is that many of the changes which happen in America that are good, by definition, have to happen outside Washington.Generations of experience has taught us that the private sector functions best when the Government supports it but does not direct it; frames environment but does not intrude upon it; when the climate is stable and sustaining but when you can create jobs and grow the economy through your own enterprise.For many years I was charged with being the chief advocate for the business community of my State.I went around the world trying to sell our products and increase investment in our State.We worked on a long-term strategy under the most difficult imaginable circumstances.When I took office in 1983, our unemployment rate was in double digits and most of our counties had unemployment rates not only in double digits but in the high unemployment counties in the State we had several counties with unemployment rates in excess of 20 percent.And we set about to increase investment, increase competitiveness, improve the education and training of our work force.Last year we ranked second in the country in job growth, and for the last 5 years have been in the top 10, not because of anything I did but because of what we did.There has to be a clear partnership here that empowers the private sector to grow jobs by having the right kind of environment, the right kind of incentives, and the right kind of long-term commitments.This is the sort of commitment that I seek to bring to the Nation with this national economic program.I think it is impossible to underestimate the importance of any particular element although there are those who will.If we don't reduce the deficit, long-term interest rates don't go down, and the Government spends more of your money paying interest.If we don't cut spending, the deficit reduction package has no credibility.And besides that, a lot of this spending really needs to be cut.If we don't raise some revenues, we won't really cut the deficit as much as we should.And if we don't have some targeted investments, we will ignore the fact for the last 12 years, while other countries have been putting more into infrastructure, into technology, and into education and training, relative to the efforts of our competitors, we have been declining.And in absolute dollars, our Federal effort has declined in many critical areas.So I would argue that we need a comprehensive approach.But let me be clear again: This administration understands clearly that the private sector is the central engine of economic growth.I have tried to put together a plan that will enable you to succeed.I hope that this plan and this speech, frankly, is just the beginning of a continuing dialog between us.I don't accept the conventional wisdom that a President has about 6 months, and after that everybody's running for reelection and everything's over and the political climate takes over.The truth is that we have been going in a certain direction economically for 2 decades, and we have been in the grip of a partisan and interest-dominated gridlock for a long time, and it is not going to turn around overnight.And a lot of the things that I have to do here with our business cannot be done overnight.And so we need a dialog, a set of continuous changes.If it is true that business has to manage change on a constant basis, surely it must also be true of Government.We can no longer afford the luxury of being told that the President has a year to work and after that everybody just waits around until the next election.That is a highly unproductive way to spend your money.And I believe we can do better.Every one of you who's ever run any sort of enterprise knows that there comes a time in the life of any organization when the person in charge has to face facts and change or just let the thing drift into decline, maybe sudden loss.I sought this office because I became convinced that the classic American idea of progress, the idea that if we worked hard, played by the rules, made the necessary adjustments, we'd all do a little better, and we could certainly leave a better life to our children.And that idea had been imperiled by our failure to face many of the fundamental realities about which I have already spoken.Our Government has responsibilities which have been too long neglected: to run a balanced economy, to invest in our people, to support business ability, to create wealth.In this city, people are very good at blaming one another for who did the wrong thing and pointing the finger at one another, but we've not been very good in the last few years at forgetting about blame and assuming responsibility.Last Wednesday when I gave my State of the Union speech to Congress, I said to the Republicans and the Democrats in the audience, and I say to you, that I don't much care anymore whose fault our problems are.I do think we should all be willing to assume responsibility for improving the situation.And if it gets better, I could care less who gets credit for it.But the time has come to go to work.I think that, to be fair, before I ask any of you to change anything, I need to set an example with the Federal Government.Let me begin by saying there are an awful lot of good people who work for you everyday in the Federal Government, people of astonishing dedication.And like any other business, there are a lot of people who are out there in the Federal Government who know a lot more than I do about what we could do to change it, to save you money, and to make it work.But as an institution, our system has become too large, too slow, too unresponsive.The Government accepts, even when it's doing things that you would all agree with, is often locked into a style of management and outmoded priorities on spending and regulation and rule-making that hamper even the best of intentions.Really, if this Government were a business, it would have gone under a long time ago.And again I say, not because of the people working here&mdash;most of the people who work for you decided to do this because they love their country, and they believe in public service-but because we have simply not been forced to undergo the discipline of reexamining how we do our business.And so it is time to take stock of Government, not just from the point of view of cutting but from the point of view of how it can be made to work.We have to look through every program and ask if it works.I've said this before, but I'll say it to you in case any of you missed it, I felt enormous sympathy for all my predecessors when I walked into the Oval Office and found that I had Jimmy Carter's phone system operating with Lyndon Johnson's switchboard.But the point is that that really is a metaphor for the fact that Government often feels that it doesn't need to reexamine it.It was amazing.Well, anyway, I think the Government has to set an example.So I have submitted to the Congress a budget that, in the coming fiscal year, will cut the White House staff by 25 percent below what it was when my predecessor left office, and not only cutting it but reorganizing it so that it will function better.We'll have a smaller drug policy office with more influence and more impact.We'll have an Economic Policy Council for only the second time in our country's history to go with the Domestic Policy Council and the National Security Council so that we can bring all the people who have an influence on economic policy together and focus on every aspect of it so that the right hand knows what the left hand is doing, and so that, hopefully, we can do a better job of anticipating the real consequences of any decisions which are inane.I've also asked the Congress to cancel next year's pay raise for Federal employees and to reduce their raises in each of the following 3 years, not because I want to hurt those people-they make this Government go&mdash;but because we have to tighten our belts before we ask Americans to tighten theirs.I have submitted a budget that reduces the administrative costs of every Federal Agency in the next 4 years by 3 percent, 3 percent, 3 percent, and 5 percent, a total of 14; and which will reduce by attrition, not by firing, the Federal work payroll by 100,000, for savings in excess of $9 billion.I was pleased the other night when I went up to the Congress to deliver my talk that the leadership told me they were going to reduce the staffs of Congress by the same amount that we reduced the administrative budget of the Federal Government, which is a real change and a welcome one.We have also tried to reduce a lot of the executive perks to set an example.A lot of our Secretaries are now eating in the dining room with their employees, and they're finding they're learning more during the lunch hour about how we can improve the Agency than they could have in all the meetings that have been scheduled.But these things are the tip of the iceberg.We have really got to find a way to reinvent the way the Government works, to bring modern technology and modern management practices to the workplace, to speed the flow of information, streamline decisions, and empower people at the grass roots level.I want you to be able to look at your National Government a couple of years from now as a model for customer service, not a bureaucratic monstrosity.As an indication of that commitment, I have appointed as the Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget for Management, my friend Phil Lader, a remarkable businessman from South Carolina, who understands these concepts and will be able for the first time to make the management part of the Office of Management and Budget as important as the budget part.It's not just important to cut the spending; it's important that whatever you give us we spend right.And I think we can.Let me just give you one example.We have contributed an inordinate amount of money to the Superfund to clean up sites which need to be cleaned up.The money is being used to pay lawyers' fees instead to clean up the sites.We might as well have just have been crass and said, We don't care about the environmental consequences.We're not going to raise this money.We're not going to have a fund.Then we could pat ourselves on the back and say, We're really concerned about this environmental problem of toxic waste sites, and so we raised the Superfund.Except the Fund's not being spent to clean up the sites.We're going to fund a way to spend that money cleaning up pollution not paying for lawyers.That's the kind of thing we have to do if we're going to run this Government right.There are also 150 very specific budget cuts in this budget.And to people who say to me, Well, you ought to be able to find more, I say, that's right, but there's 150 I found in 4 weeks that haven't been there in 12 years.So I feel that we're doing pretty good.I'm more than happy to do more.But since the first budget President Reagan submitted in 1981, which did have a lot of very specific budget cuts, this budget is the one that has the most specific cuts.Not saying to the Congress, 'Well, let's put a cap on this or a lid on that and you all figure out how to distribute the pain, but saying, I'll take responsibility for angering these constituencies by cutting this spending.Can we do more? Of course we can.But we had to get off to a fast start.And I have made a good-faith offer to Republicans as well as Democrats, and to the Congress, and to people around the country to talk about how we can do that.It is very, very important.The second thing I want to say to you, however, is that there is a big structural deficit which it is difficult to overcome by budget cuts alone, for this reason: Every year we grant cost-of-living increases to people on Social Security, and we should.There is a surplus in the Social Security tax fund which is being used to make the deficit look smaller.And that is very hard on small business in America, by the way, that we finance so much of our Government through the payroll tax.We'll need those payroll taxes later, but not now.We have increases in health care for the same reasons you do, that is, the cost of health care is rising faster than the rate of inflation.That drives up the cost of Medicare for the elderly and Medicaid for low-income people.And then we have another problem aggravated by the flaws in our system, which is that every month in this country 100,000 Americans lose their health insurance and some of them are eligible for the Medicaid programs for the working poor.So our costs go up as private sector folks can't afford to cover people with health insurance anymore, and they get pushed onto the Government payroll.So those increases occur and will continue to occur until we reform structurally the health care system.And I'll come back to that in a moment.So those increases are there.Then there are some programs that I think are quite central to our economy that require us to continue to fund them.Many are controversial with those who don't benefit from them, but I believe in some of them.I'll tell you a couple I believe in.I think that we should continue to fund the superconducting super collider because I think it's good science, even though it's expensive.We are going to create a lot of jobs in the future through investments in technology and science.I believe that we cannot afford the space station design we have been operating on.And it hasn't been properly funded for years, and it's having huge costs overruns.But I think there should be a space station program that supports our shuttle program and supports the kinds of technological benefits that space has produced for the American economy here down on the ground over the last several years.And so I will support that, though we will not increase that spending as rapidly as it would take to support the old design.But we will do enough to keep all the people that are working, working in this area that I think is important.And that means we'll spend more money on that, and I think that's significant.But there still will be net budget cuts that are very deep, and I'm looking for more.I also want to say that I intend to make reports to you on that, and before we get to any tax increases I want to know that the spending cuts are going to be there.I will not sign a tax increase without the spending cuts.The tax problem, as you know, is highly progressive.And some say that it is so progressive that it will discourage people from reinvesting.I would just ask you to study the whole thing.We provide for the first time in the history of the country a permanent investment tax credit for small businesses for 90 percent of the employers who have 40 percent of the workers but create a majority of the jobs in this country.We provided alternative minimum tax relief for the big capital-intensive businesses of this country, who have told us repeatedly that the alternative minimum tax treatment in the present Tax Code actually discourages people from making investments.We have provided some relief from the passive-loss provisions of the income Tax Code for people who are in the real estate business, because I think that has aggravated the condition not only of real estate but of some of our banks and contributed to the credit crunch.So I think there will be both direct benefits to real estate and indirect benefits to people who had to get bank financing by changing this passive-loss provision.There are lots of other things in this bill which I think are important to the creation of jobs.So I ask you to look at it as a whole package and to recognize that we have to, again, move away from a tax system that is based too much on fixed-rate taxes, like excise and payroll taxes, more toward income taxes that have also offsetting incentives to invest.I believe that that is the proper direction to go.I know there is also some controversy over the energy tax.And I'd like to talk about that for just a moment.If we are to fund more revenue, I would rather not tax work and effort of working people.I would instead rather have some tax that operates on consumption and promotes energy efficiency in the development of alternative energy technologies.We have the lowest energy taxes in the world by far.And there was an enormous consensus among the deficit-reducing folks all over the country that there ought to be an energy tax but a big difference about what kind it ought to be.There were those, principally in the East, who said we needed a huge gas tax.I can hear the groan from my folks up there in the gallery.It's tough on people who live in the West or who have to drive long distances to work where there's no public transport, where there's no practical carpooling.It really could have an adverse impact on sectors of our transportation economy.Then there were those who if you want only to clean up the environment, you should have a carbon tax.The problem is, that's pretty rough if you're from Pennsylvania or Ohio or West Virginia or someplace where coal is important to the economy and where you're already bearing the enormous burden of the enforcement of the Clean Air Act.So this Btu tax, taxing the heat content of energy, seemed to be a fair way of spreading the burden in a limited way across all energy sources, in a way that would still do what I think needs to he done, which is to promote conservation and not undermine something else that I strongly support, which is the increased production of natural gas in America.It's our fuel.It's clean, and it will create enormous economic opportunities in the future.I want to say again, I don't want to raise one penny of this money unless we have the spending cuts.Not a penny.And I am sure, after now almost 5 weeks in office, that there are more cuts coming.I can tell you I will find more.And I think we have gotten everybody in the National Government interested in finding more.And I encourage you to give us more.Nothing is off the table, except those things that reflect the fundamental interest of the American people.But remember, we don't want to do anything that will further erode our investment in our children and their future in programs that are working.Indeed, we need to do more there.And we cannot afford to break the fragile bond of responsibility we have with elderly people who live on Social Security for all their income and who need Medicare for their health care.We can reduce further health care expenditures of the Government but only in the context of an overall resolution of the health care crisis.The plan I have presented will reduce the deficit substantially and fairly.And if we do, it will mean lower interest rates.You can see that already by this historic low in long-term interest rates coming out today.I also want to say, however, that in my judgment, there are some things we should invest in, not just the things I've mentioned for business: the permanent investment tax credit for small business, the targeted capital gains tax, the technology extension center, the manufacturing changes in the alternative minimum tax, the incremental investment tax credit that will be available to every business in America over the next couple of years.But there are also some things that we need to invest in our people.And I'd like just to mention one or two of them.Another change in this tax system is one that I will hope you will all support, and it is the one that enables us to hold harmless to 40-plus percent of the taxpayers with incomes of $30,000 or less.This is a dramatic increase in the refundable earned-income tax credit for working people.This mechanism in this plan will enable us to say for the first time in the history of the country, If you are a full-time worker with a child in your house, you will not live in poverty.Let me say why I think that is so important.One of the things we have to deal with in America to make ourselves more productive is how we can reduce the volume of the large underclass we have: the people who are permanently trapped in poverty, the children living in the big cities.And we have to think of strategies to deal with that.Some of those things are things that I think you can do.I have proposed, for example, urban enterprise zones which give huge incentives for private sector investment in depressed areas.But we have to break the psychology of poverty and dependence on the Government.I will come forward later this year with a welfarereform proposal that will literally end welfare as we know it, will say we'll have education and training and child care and health care.After 2 years you've either got to go to work or do public service work to draw an income tax from the Government.But consider this: We also need to build in incentives.you know as well as I do from the people you work with that an incentive system is better most of the time than a rulemaking system.So we can have a welfare rulemaking system, but you've got to change the incentives.How many working women are there in America today who barely make ends meet because of the cost of child care? I mean, an enormous number.So what this refundable earned-income tax credit will do is to change the economic system.It will say: We are going to reward work.You put in your 40 hours; you've got a kid in the house.If we need to, we will refund money through the tax system, but we're going to lift you above the poverty line so no one will ever have that as an excuse not to be a productive citizen.If everybody in this country were working, we wouldn't have half the problems that the Government wrestles with here all day, every day.And I hope you can support that.Now, let me just make another couple of comments that relate to this.In the next few days we will be announcing some initiatives that we're going to take from a regulatory point of view to try to deal with the credit crunch, to try to make it possible for banks to loan money to businesses again, to try to release the energies for the old-fashioned character of small business loans, to try to reduce the fear that a lot of banks have that if they make sensible loans, the Government will come down on them.I think that the improvement in the books that will come from changing the passive-loss provision, plus the regulatory changes we make, will really make a dent in this credit crunch problem, especially in the areas of our country where it has been so profound.And if it isn't, you let me know about it in a few months, and we'll do something else.We have got to deal with this problem for small business to grow again.Now, let me talk just very briefly about what I think will become very quickly a controversial part of this program.There will be those who Avant to cut spending and wish we didn't have to raise any taxes, who will say, You wouldn't have to raise so many taxes if you didn't spend any new money on anything.And that is absolutely true.I admit that is absolutely true.I Avant you to know what I propose to spend new money on and why, in addition to the tax incentives I've already discussed.First of all, I want to increase research and development in new technologies that will create new jobs and new economic opportunities, dramatically.Not only by making the research and experimentation tax credit permanent, but by increasing commercial R&D by more than we reduce defense R&D, and by emphasizing dualuse technologies in defense research and development.It is killing me to look at the numbers when you compare the percentage of our income we're spending on research and development in America compared to our competitors.Five years, 10 years, 20 years from now, that means more high-wage jobs somewhere else and fewer high-wage jobs here.And we cannot tolerate it.We must again achieve competitive levels of R&D, and that is a worthy expenditure of your tax money.We have good people who will do that right and spend it efficiently, and I would hope you would support it.There is no way the private sector can equal the aggregate efforts in Germany, Japan, or any other rich country, provided there by enormous public sector investment to support the private sector.So I hope you'll be for that.Secondly, I think we have to invest more in our infrastructure, in our roads, our bridges, our airports, in high-speed rail, in water projects, in sewer projects, in environmental cleanup.We are again spending a much lower percentage of our income on that than all of our major competitors.And that bears a direct relationship to productivity, to wealth generation, and to the cost of doing business in the private sector.So we propose to fully fund the surface transportation act and to do a lot of things in this area.Third, Ave propose to really invest some money in targeted people investments that will increase productivity.Let me just mention three or four.Number one, we want to spend some new money to set up a network that will permit us to immunize every child in America by the age of two for preventable childhood diseases.For every dollar Ave spend on that today, we will save $10 in the future in preventable diseases.We are dangerously at risk of new outbreaks of diseases because our immunization levels have fallen so low.Most of the controversy you've seen in the press is about the price of vaccines, and that's a legitimate issue.But it is also true that we don't have the delivery network in this country we need.And as a result, we have the appalling statistic that in America, which produces vaccines for the world, we have the third-lowest immunization rate in this hemisphere.Only Bolivia and Haiti are lower.It is unconscionable.We can't justify it.For a little bit of money today we can save big bucks tomorrow.Secondly, we ought to fully fund the Head Start program, because it is a proven success that will save us $3 tomorrow for every dollar we spend today.Those are among the things that I think we should do.Let me just mention two others.We ought to have an apprenticeship program in America that guarantees every high school graduate access to 2 years of further quality education in the workplace, in a community college, in a vocational institution.The Federal Government's responsibility here is basically to help States in the private sector create networks and to fill the funding gap.For next to no money we could bring our 2-year education program up to where it is universally accessible to all Americans and it is at a level of quality comparable to our competitors.We are not there today.For not very much money, we can do that.The next thing I think we really ought to do is to open the doors to college education to all Americans.Not just open them, but keep them open.The college drop-out rate today is two and a half times the high school drop-out rate.And one reason is that a college education is about the only thing that increased more rapidly than health care costs in the 1980's.Now, all of you need to think about this as this is something you can do that I can't since all these colleges&mdash;none of them are Federal institutions.Something needs to be done to contain the rising costs of those colleges.But in the meantime, we need to make sure that young Americans are not dropping out just because they can't afford to go.The student loan program today is wildly expensive.It costs $4 billion a year, $3 billion in defaulted loans alone.And what we need to do is to set up an income-contingent repayment plan so everybody can pay back as a percentage of their income, which will reduce the incentive to default; really stiffen the collection measures, including involving the IRS in it.I'm tired of people making money and defaulting on their loans; that's not right.But Ave also should make available the opportunity for many young Americans to pay back their student loans by serving their country, by going borne and working as teachers or police officers, or doing things that need to be done in the community.We can rescue a lot of these kids out of inner cities by letting them work before they go to college and put in time in building up credits so that they then turn their loans into scholarships before they even go.These are things that ought to be done.You know, when President Kennedy started the Peace Corps, it shaped the imagination of a whole generation.We need a peace corps here at home to deal with our problems here at home, and it needs to be much bigger than the Peace Corps ever was.Finally, let me just make this point: If we cut spending, increase revenues, target investments, we'll have a Government that will go in the fight direction for the next 4 years with real discipline.If you want to get to the end of the decade with a healthy American economy, we have to do something else.We've got to reform the health care system.In 5 years, projected Government expenditures on health care would go from $210 billion to $350 billion, a two-thirds increase, annualized increase of 12 percent per year.We are already spending, as of the end of 1992, 14 percent of our gross domestic product on health care.No other nation in the world except Canada is over nine, and they're just barely over nine.And our health indicators are not all that much better.In fact, they're quite worse in some areas.Now, this is not a simple problem.This is the most complex issue with which I have ever tried to come to grips.But one thing is pretty clear: If present spending trends continue, we'll be bumping 20 percent of GDP by the end of the decade, and you can forget about our being competitive in manufacturing.At our economic conference in Little Book, Red Poling, the chairman of Ford Motor Company, pointed out how Ford's heath care costs had risen by 800 percent in the last 20 years, and now they spend as much on health care for workers as on steel for cars.Almost $1,100 of the price of each American car is in health care.Our competitors in Japan have only $550 in a car; hard to be price competitive and make money.Small businesses are hit even harder by health care costs.And for many self-employed people and farmers, it's impossible to get health care.As I said earlier, 100,000 Americans a month are losing their health insurance.Seventy percent of the small businesses in this country are still providing health care to their employees, but they're hurt very badly by insurance-rating practices in most States.And workers are terrorized by the fact that if they or someone in their family has ever been sick, they have a preexisting condition which locks them into a job.I had dinner the other night with a high school friend of my wife who is a wonderful small business guy with four employees.And one of his employees just had a child with Down's syndrome.And he told me, he said, You know, that guy and I, we're partners for life now.And he said, He really can do better.He's a gifted person.I want him to be able to go on and move, and he can't.And more and more businesses are having to give up their health insurance every year or run the co-pay so high they might as well be giving up on it.And that, as I said earlier, is driving some people back down into the Federal Government's and the State government's health care system.What I want to do is to find a way to preserve what is best about American health care&mdash;the right to choose your doctor, the technology that we have&mdash;and stop the incredible waste on paperwork, which means that clerical workers are being hired at 4 times the rate of health care providers in hospitals and doctors' offices, on unnecessary technology, on the absence of preventive and primary care, on all the things that we know that are wrong.And some time in the next several weeks, within 100 days after the time I took office, we'll be presenting a plan to the Congress and the American people to deal with that.But I want to be up-front about this.The economic plan I have presented will bring that debt down for 4 years.If we don't deal with the health care crisis, it's going to turn around and go right back up in the next 4 years, just like your costs are going to.We have got to face this.Every other advanced country in the world has devised some system which works better than ours does to keep costs closer to inflation while providing a basic package of benefits to all Americans.We cannot fix this economy over the long run unless we do that.It is inhumane.It is also very bad business to let the status quo persist.Let me close just by saying that if every American looks at my proposal in terms of what is best for him or her, at least one-third of it will seem unattractive.That is, if you're an upper-income person who has to pay the income taxes, you would say, Give me the budget cuts and don't increase spending.Unless you're in a technology-related business in which you might say, Give me the budget cuts and the new investments, but forget about the tax increases.Or if you're an educator, you might say, Fund Head Start.A middle-class person might say, Tax the rich and spend the money on new jobs.Cut the budget, but forget about the energy tax.A lower-income person might say, Tax the wealthy.Give me the new spending, but forget about the budget cuts.In other words, if everybody looks at this just through the prism of how it will immediately affect you, it's a nonstarter, because there's no way you can bat three for three.We can't get there.And that's why I say to all of you what I have asked the American people to do; I invite your efforts to improve this, to say what's wrong with it, to say how we can make it better.That's fine.But ask the question, not just what's in it for me, but what's in it for us.This country has got to change.We know we cannot stay on the present course.We know we cannot stay on the present course.We also know if we look ahead to the future that the next 20 years could be the best years this country ever had.But we've got to increase productivity.We've got to increase job generation.We've got to increase income, and we've got to increase our ability to rely on all the American people.We do not have a person to waste.I believe this program achieves those objectives, and I ask for your support.Thank you very much, and God bless you.",clinton
"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.I want to formally welcome Prime Minister Major to the White House and to the United States.We are delighted to have him here.As I'm sure you know, he has already met earlier today with people on the Hill and with members of my Cabinet.We have just finished the first of two meetings.We talked for about an hour, and then this evening we'll have a working dinner.About the conversations we've had so far, I'd just like to make two points.First, we covered a wide range of topics.We talked about Bosnia, as you might imagine we would.We talked about the Middle East.And then the rest of our time was spent virtually exclusively talking about economic matters, about the upcoming meeting of the G-7; about the importance of trying to get an agreement under GATT and my commitment to that; about the absolute necessity of the United States, Europe, and Japan working together during this difficult time to try to prevent a contraction of the global economy and instead to hopefully promote growth, not only here at home but throughout the world.And we talked about that at some considerable detail.The Prime Minister, as you know, has been in office a lot longer than I have.And I asked him for his advice about a number of things and his opinion about others.And we had a very, very good meeting.And I'm looking forward to our dinner tonight.A second point I would like to make is to reaffirm something that some of you asked me during the photo op, and that is whether the United States will continue to have a very special relationship with Great Britain.The answer to that from my point of view is an unqualified yes.I think that only two Presidents ever lived in England.I think I'm one of only two.There may have been more somewhere in the past centuries.But this is a very important relationship to me, and I think it's off to a very good start.And I would like to say again how much I appreciate the candor with which the Prime Minister has approached the issues, with which we've discussed our mutual interests.Mr.Prime Minister.Prime Minister Major.Mr.President, firstly, thank you for your welcome today.And I've found our meeting extremely useful, and I look forward to continuing it this evening.And I certainly had some very useful meetings this morning on the Hill and with other members of your Cabinet earlier this morning, with Lloyd Bentsen, and of course over lunch as well with some of your colleagues.It's nice, having bad a number of telephone conversations over the last few months, to actually see a face across the table rather than just hear a voice across the phone.And I look forward to continuing that dialog this evening.You set out some of the things that we were able to discuss over the last hour or so.I was particularly pleased we were able to reach such a meeting of minds on the importance of reaching an agreement to the Uruguay round as speedily as possible.I think we share the view that for a raft of reasons it's important to get a satisfactory and fair agreement to the GATT round, not just because of the impetus that will give to trade growth and hopefully to prosperity and job growth as well but also because of the very remarkable advantage that will give not just to the industrialized but to the nonindustrialized world with the many difficulties that are faced economically at the moment.So I was particularly pleased at our meeting of minds on that particular subject.We found also a complete agreement about the need for the Security Council resolutions that have been imposed in respect to Iraq to be fully met and to be fully honored in the future.I had the pleasure of being able to welcome the President's initiative, humanitarian airdrops in Bosnia.The United Kingdom&mdash;we've got a number of thousands of troops actually delivering humanitarian aid in central Bosnia.They've been doing that for some time.I think as a result of their activities, many people who otherwise might not have lived through ibis winter have done.And I think this new initiative by the President is thoroughly welcome.So it's been a very worthwhile and a very enjoyable meeting thus far, and I look forward to continuing it this evening.Thank you.President, do you still want a U.S.If the United States can in some way make a constructive contribution to a political settlement, of course, we'd be interested in doing that.But that is not a subject we have discussed in any way so far.And I think I'd rather wait to make further comments until after we have a chance to discuss it.As far as the campaign, the campaign is over.You're a good one to ask that question, since you know that compared to previous campaigns I've been in, this was just sort of another day at the office.And once you achieve the responsibilities of office, that's what you have to do.I told the Prime Minister today that I was just grateful that I got through this whole campaign with most of my time in England still classified.I'd like to ask both you and the Prime Minister, what do you think can be accomplished in the airdrops, since many in the military believe that it will not be terribly effective or efficient? And what other steps do you think need to be taken, military steps, in particular, such as some that were discussed during the campaign, in order to inflict enough pressure on the Serbs? Let me deal with the airdrops first.General Powell came over here last weekend, and we talked for a very extended period of time about this operation and about how we can maximize the safety to United States pilots and other personnel on the planes who'd be involved in this and minimize the prospect that any humanitarian relief operation could be drawn into the politics and the military operations of this area.We know that if we are high enough to virtually assure the complete safety of the people who will participate in the airlift, that a percentage of the packages we drop will be outside the more or less half-mile circle that we would be trying to hit.We also know that if we leaflet the area in advance, if we notify the people about what we're dropping and how to use the medicine and what kind of food will be there, to whatever extent people need it, they'll be on the lookout for it.And if they have to walk a mile instead of a half-mile for it, we think they will.So we believe that, A, there is a need in some of the remote areas, and B, we can do this with quite an effective but safe mission.Now, insofar as other actions, I think there are a number of things that we're looking at.I'm encouraged by the United Nations interest in the war crimes issue.I'm encouraged by the conversation the Prime Minister and I had about the importance of trying to make the sanctions that are now in force actively be more effective.But I would remind you that our policy is that we want to try to have a good faith in negotiations with all the parties there.We are committed to doing what we can to encourage the Bosnians to engage in negotiations within the Vance-Owen framework.And President Yeltsin has been very forthcoming on his part in trying to help get the negotiations back on track, too.So, I think we should look at it just from that point of view.It would be a great mistake to read this humanitarian relief operation as some initial foray toward a wider military role.Prime Minister Major.Can I just add something to that, as you requested.We're able, at the moment, to deliver a substantial amount of aid in central Bosnia by land.But the natural terrain of Bosnia, as a whole, means that isn't practicable for a raft of reasons, not least geographical reasons, at the moment in all parts of Bosnia.I think, therefore, you do have to look at imaginative ways of actually getting food aid and medicine aid through.And I think the prospect that the President is exploring is an imaginative one, and I hope it will prove successful.There are a number of logistics to be worked out.On sanctions, one of the things we have been discussing in the last half an hour or so is the prospects of enhanced sanctions, and I think there clearly are opportunities there that we'll need to examine.Well, I think we can improve the sanctions over the Danube, for example.I don't think they're being enforced very effectively.Do you think that Yeltsin, President Yeltsin, is so politically weakened that his days are numbered? Also, what can the U.S.and the allies do to prop him up, to prevent another Communist takeover that could lead to another cold war? And are you going to meet President Yeltsin in March at any point? Prime Minister Major.I don't think President Yeltsin is weakened by his present conflict to the extent that he's not going to continue.Clearly there are difficulties in the disputes he's had with Congress and, in particular, the Speaker.But I expect President Yeltsin to be there and to continue.I think he's the best hope for the Russians, and I think the policies and the movements towards reform that he has in mind and continues to have in mind are the right ways forward.I think there are two things we can do to help Russia in general and President Yeltsin.One is the economic assistance that's been provided, and there's a great deal of discussion to be had about whether we're directing that in the right way and in the right volume.And secondly, I think also there's the political messages of support to the reformers and to the reform policies, personified at the moment in the person of President Yeltsin.But the underlying purpose of the assistance is to assist the reformers and to assist the reform policies in Russia.I think we ought to give them political support as well as the practical and economic support that we've been giving them.I believe that President Yeltsin has not been paralyzed by what's happened.I support him and his role and what he's trying to do.I have not established a definite date for a meeting with him yet, but I do hope to meet with him soon personally.I know he's having some trouble with his Congress, but that's part of being in a democratic society with an elected President separate from the Congress.He may just be learning what it's like in our system.I don't want to minimize that, but I think it is a grave error to assume that he cannot continue and do well.I believe he can.And I think that in terms of what we ought to be doing about it, I think the Prime Minister has pretty well laid out the kind of political and economic support we ought to be giving.But let me say that as all of you know, I have placed a great priority on this.The State Department will now have an ambassador at large whose job it is to coordinate a response not only to Russia but to all the Republics of the former Soviet Union.And we have a very distinguished American, Thomas Pickering, nominated to be our Ambassador to Moscow.We are putting a lot of effort into trying to support democracy and trying to support economic recovery there.I wonder, do you take away from your meeting with him any renewed sense of the importance of that round, and if so, how you plan now to approach it? Well, we're going to ask for an extension of fast track authority.And we're going to really put a real effort into a successful conclusion of the round.I advocated that in 1991 at the beginning of my race for President, and I still feel very strongly that it's important.I think if you look at the press response around the world to the economic plan I've presented to Congress, it's been very positive because our trading partners have been asking us for years to make a real effort to reduce the debt.And so we're doing that.And I think that sparks hope not only here at home but around the world.And I think if we were to successfully conclude the Uruguay round, that would also spark hope that we will be expanding trade on terms that are fair to everyone.So I'm very hopeful that we can get a trade agreement.And after we do, I'll be happy to answer your questions.There's been a lot of effort to block it so far.Well, all I can tell you is General Powell has been&mdash;let me answer, and then he'll answer&mdash;has been asked to design the mission in such a way that we would minimize risk to our folks.And we have obviously engaged in an extensive consultation, which is not over.The consultations aren't over.And one of the things that we want, we want everybody to know that this is a humanitarian mission, that we're prepared to help anybody who needs the food and medicine.And we want the broadest possible support for this.And we want all the people on the ground in the various factions to know that this is not a political issue with us.We're very encouraged by the responses we've gotten so far to all the elements with whom we have discussed this plan.That's all I can tell you.Prime Minister, could you answer, please? Prime Minister Major.I don't think there's a great deal to add to it.As I indicated earlier, there's a twin-track approach.We're providing aid by land.The President has in mind aid delivered by air to areas where we can't reach it by land.I've no reason to suppose that that is going to put at risk the lives of the British soldiers in central Bosnia.If they don't want this material to be delivered, they have to use that.Prime Minister Major.Well, you asked the question.I've given you the judgment I make.President, you said you discussed the Middle East.Did you reach any conclusion, and do you favor returning to the peace talks even if the Palestinians do not? We talked mostly about the importance of adhering to the United Nations resolutions as they apply to Iraq and the aftermath of the Gulf war and about our general support for the peace process continuing.We didn't deal with that issue, and I think I ought to wait until the Secretary of State returns from his mission before I discuss it further.Is there any realistic expectations at this point that any other country except for the United States will be involved in this airdrop? Yes, we might have some other countries involved in it.I don't think it would be&mdash;I believe the Prime Minister made his statement.I think he's done his part.His troops are on the ground there.But I think there is a chance that we will have support from other nations.Do you think that the current Vance-Owen map forms the fair basis for a settlement of the crisis in the former Yugoslavia? Prime Minister Major.Well, that the matter that has to be negotiated between the parties.And I don't think I'm going to express a view on whether that is the right map.I think the process of seeking a negotiated settlement and trying to reach by agreement between the three parties, an agreement on the map that will enable a political settlement to be reached is the right way.But I don't think it's for me to judge whether the map is right.Clearly, the views of the participants at the moment is that the map isn't right.But that is the purpose of negotiations.That is why I was delighted to hear this morning that Karadzic and Izethegovic will be joining talks again with Boban so that they can actually talk to Cy Vance and David Owen and see if they can reach an agreement.The first prize is clearly an agreement that is reached voluntarily and willingly and as speedily as possible.The only thing I would say, just to add to that, is that I agree with what the Prime Minister has said.As you know, the United States feels very strongly that this agreement must be just that, an agreement that must not be shoved down the throat of the Bosnians or anyone else if it's going to work.We also feel strongly that all the parties should negotiate in good faith.And therefore, I agree with what he said about the map.I would make this further point: The United States has made it clear in our statement of policy that if an agreement is reached in good faith, that we would be prepared to be part of a NATO or United Nations effort to monitor or support the agreement, and that map would be difficult to monitor and support, I think.But I think we're going to have to&mdash;before we make any final judgments, we need to give the parties a chance to reach their accord.Will you give a sense of when? And are you really talking about a new round of cuts or just&mdash; Oh well, what I said was, I have invited the Members of the Congress to present them to me and instructed our people to continue to look for them.And I presume as we define things that we're willing to put on the table, we will continue to do it.We don't have any orchestrated theory about how to do that now.But I'd be surprised if there aren't some more coming.Prime Minister, were you disappointed or taken aback by what the President said the other day about the airbus, and were you reassured by your conversations today? Prime Minister Major.There's an agreement over the degree of subsidies for projects like airbus.And that agreement continues into July, and I think there is no proposition in what the President said to change that particular agreement.President, you said you may discuss Northern Ireland this evening.Prime Minister Major.Well, I'll address that point first.The real abuse of human rights in Northern Ireland is the abuse of human rights of people who find bombs in shopping malls when they're going about their ordinary, everyday business.I think that is the abuse of human rights that is overwhelmingly the concern of everybody in Northern Ireland on both sides of the sectarian divide.Over the past 2 or 3 years, the British Government with the Taoiseach and with the political parties in Northern Ireland, have been engaged on talks to try and find a political settlement to a problem that has existed in Northern Ireland for generations.We are seeking that agreement.Those talks, I believe it is fair to say, have made more progress than most people believed was possible.Talks came to a halt with the general election in the Republic of Ireland and the forthcoming local elections in Northern Ireland.But it is the policy of my government to resume those talks, to resume those talks with all the parties in Northern Ireland and try and reach a satisfactory political settlement and remove many of the disputes and hatreds that have existed for generations.Those disputes and hatreds are worsened by violence, whether it is the IRA violence or whether it is the response to IRA violence which has also been prevalent over the last year or so.I condemn both unreservedly and without any distinction.I believe that obviously there has to be a political solution there, or there will be no solution at all, and that the human fights issues will have to be addressed in that context.Whether the United States can play any sort of constructive role is something that we want to discuss later this evening.Press Secretary Myers.Last question.President, here just one week after your speech announcing your budget and economic plan, Senator Bob Dole is pronouncing it in trouble.What's your read on that, and do you think this is the start of a war of words that's going to slow down the whole process?Well, I think you have to expect that there would be some trouble.And the Senate Minority Leader can say that.But he was here during the last 12 years when other Presidents and the Congress quadrupled the national debt.I'm trying to do something about it and turn it around and go in the opposite direction.The surveys show that a big majority of the American people support my initiative.The response from people and governments around the world, it's been almost uniformly positive that America's trying to change the nature of its economic policy, reduce its debt, increase investment in high growth items.And I never expected this to be easy.This is a fundamental change.I don't expect it to be easy.But I hope that I'll be working with Senator Dole and with others to bring it to a successful conclusion.We had a very nice conversation, which was mostly personal.And I thanked him for his kindness to me.And he assured me that his country would continue to work with me and that he would personally until his tenure in office was over.I wish him well.He seemed to be a person who had worked through this and was very much at peace with himself today.Prime Minister Major.Can I just answer that point as well? I regard Brian as an old friend and a good friend.I shall miss him.He's been a very good friend to the United Kingdom and a very good friend to the Commonwealth.So I'm sad to hear of his decision today.It must be his decision.I wish him well in the future, and I look forward to seeing him in the United Kingdom in a few weeks' time.Prime Minister, do you think there's any constructive role the United States can play in solving the Northern Ireland problem? Prime Minister Major.I think from time to time distinguished visitors from the United States in Northern Ireland have come back to the United States, and they have actually explained the remarkable changes that have taken part in Belfast.There was a delegation that was there recently.And the reality is that anyone who knew the place 10 years ago and knows the place today will see there is an absolute and total sea change.And I think the fact that there is a great knowledge about the willful peace amongst people in Northern Ireland and especially the ordinary people of Northern Ireland of both sides of the sectarian divide, the more that is understood, the better.And what is actually needed in Northern Ireland to help speed that is more understanding of the process, more support for the talks, more investment for job creation, and less money to fund terrorism.And the more people know about that, the nearer we come to a solution.Press Secretary Myers.Thank you.",clinton
"Prime Minister Mulroney and I had a good conversation following his announcement that he is stepping down as Prime Minister of Canada.Prime Minister Mulroney has been a good friend and partner of the United States, and I wish him well.The Free Trade Agreement, the NAFTA, and Canada's voice in helping to move the world into a more hopeful era are all testimony to his leadership and courage.It was a pleasure to meet with the Prime Minister earlier this month and to speak with him several times since my election.I greatly appreciated the Prime Minister's insight and wise counsel in tackling the common challenges of promoting world economic growth and peace.My meeting with him reinforced my conviction that Canadian engagement in world affairs remains as vital as ever.That our meeting was my first as President underscores the close relationship between our two countries.Our enduring friendship is based on the common vision we share of peace and democratic principles.From peacekeepers in Bosnia and Somalia to partnership in the G-7 and in NATO, Canada has been a true global ally.Both our people benefit from our important trading relationship, with $200 billion in goods and services alone exchanged each year.Our steadfast relationship with Canada is an indispensable element in the essential continuity of American foreign policy.As the Prime Minister and the people of Canada prepare for the road ahead, I want them to know that the United States is and will remain their friend and partner.Our cooperation will continue to grow in the years ahead.",clinton
"My fellow citizens, today we celebrate the mystery of American renewal.This ceremony is held in the depth of winter, but by the words we speak and the faces we show the world, we force the spring, a spring reborn in the world's oldest democracy that brings forth the vision and courage to reinvent America.When our Founders boldly declared America's independence to the world and our purposes to the Almighty, they knew that America, to endure, would have to change; not change for change's sake but change to preserve America's ideals: life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness.Though we marched to the music of our time, our mission is timeless.Each generation of Americans must define what it means to be an American.On behalf of our Nation, I salute my predecessor, President Bush, for his half-century of service to America.And I thank the millions of men and women whose steadfastness and sacrifice triumphed over depression, fascism, and communism.Today, a generation raised in the shadows of the cold war assumes new responsibilities in a world warmed by the sunshine of freedom but threatened still by ancient hatreds and new plagues.Raised in unrivaled prosperity, we inherit an economy that is still the world's strongest but is weakened by business failures, stagnant wages, increasing inequality, and deep divisions among our own people.When George Washington first took the oath I have just sworn to uphold, news traveled slowly across the land by horseback and across the ocean by boat.Now, the sights and sounds of this ceremony are broadcast instantaneously to billions around the world.Communications and commerce are global.Investment is mobile.Technology is almost magical.And ambition for a better life is now universal.We earn our livelihood in America today in peaceful competition with people all across the Earth.Profound and powerful forces are shaking and remaking our world.And the urgent question of our time is whether we can make change our friend and not our enemy.This new world has already enriched the lives of millions of Americans who are able to compete and win in it.But when most people are working harder for less; when others cannot work at all; when the cost of health care devastates families and threatens to bankrupt our enterprises, great and small; when the fear of crime robs law-abiding citizens of their freedom; and when millions of poor children cannot even imagine the lives we are calling them to lead, we have not made change our friend.We know we have to face hard truths and take strong steps, but we have not done so; instead, we have drifted.And that drifting has eroded our resources, fractured our economy, and shaken our confidence.Though our challenges are fearsome, so are our strengths.Americans have ever been a restless, questing, hopeful people.And we must bring to our task today the vision and will of those who came before us.From our Revolution to the Civil War, to the Great Depression, to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.Thomas Jefferson believed that to preserve the very foundations of our Nation, we would need dramatic change from time to time.Well, my fellow Americans, this is our time.Let us embrace it.Our democracy must be not only the envy of the world but the engine of our own renewal.There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America.And so today we pledge an end to the era of deadlock and drift, and a new season of American renewal has begun.To renew America, we must be bold.We must do what no generation has had to do before.We must invest more in our own people, in their jobs, and in their future, and at the same time cut our massive debt.And we must do so in a world in which we must compete for every opportunity.It will not be easy.It will require sacrifice, but it can be done and done fairly, not choosing sacrifice for its own sake but for our own sake.We must provide for our Nation the way a family provides for its children.Our Founders saw themselves in the light of posterity.We can do no less.Anyone who has ever watched a child's eyes wander into sleep knows what posterity is.Posterity is the world to come: the world for whom we hold our ideals, from whom we have borrowed our planet, and to whom we bear sacred responsibility.We must do what America does best: offer more opportunity to all and demand more responsibility from all.It is time to break the bad habit of expecting something for nothing from our Government or from each other.Let us all take more responsibility not only for ourselves and our families but for our communities and our country.To renew America, we must revitalize our democracy.This beautiful Capital, like every capital since the dawn of civilization, is often a place of intrigue and calculation.Powerful people maneuver for position and worry endlessly about who is in and who is out, who is up and who is down, forgetting those people whose toil and sweat sends us here and pays our way.Americans deserve better.And in this city today there are people who want to do better.And so I say to all of you here: Let us resolve to reform our politics so that power and privilege no longer shout down the voice of the people.Let us put aside personal advantage so that we can feel the pain and see the promise of America.Let us resolve to make our Government a place for what Franklin Roosevelt called bold, persistent experimentation, a Government for our tomorrows, not our yesterdays.Let us give this Capital back to the people to whom it belongs.To renew America, we must meet challenges abroad as well as at home.There is no longer a clear division between what is foreign and what is domestic.The world economy, the world environment, the world AIDS crisis, the world arms race: they affect us all.Today, as an older order passes, the new world is more free but less stable.Communism's collapse has called forth old animosities and new dangers.Clearly, America must continue to lead the world we did so much to make.While America rebuilds at home, we will not shrink from the challenges nor fail to seize the opportunities of this new world.Together with our friends and allies, we will work to shape change, lest it engulf us.When our vital interests are challenged or the will and conscience of the international community is defied, we will act, with peaceful diplomacy whenever possible, with force when necessary.The brave Americans serving our Nation today in the Persian Gulf, in Somalia, and wherever else they stand are testament to our resolve.But our greatest strength is the power of our ideas, which are still new in many lands.Across the world we see them embraced, and we rejoice.Our hopes, our hearts, our hands are with those on every continent who are building democracy and freedom.Their cause is America's cause.The American people have summoned the change we celebrate today.You have raised your voices in an unmistakable chorus.You have cast your votes in historic numbers.And you have changed the face of Congress, the Presidency, and the political process itself.Yes, you, my fellow Americans, have forced the spring.Now we must do the work the season demands.To that work I now turn with all the authority of my office.I ask the Congress to join with me.But no President, no Congress, no Government can undertake this mission alone.My fellow Americans, you, too, must play your part in our renewal.I challenge a new generation of young Americans to a season of service: to act on your idealism by helping troubled children, keeping company with those in need, reconnecting our torn communities.There is so much to be done; enough, indeed, for millions of others who are still young in spirit to give of themselves in service, too.In serving, we recognize a simple but powerful truth: We need each other, and we must care for one another.Today we do more than celebrate America.We rededicate ourselves to the very idea of America, an idea born in revolution and renewed through two centuries of challenge; an idea tempered by the knowledge that, but for fate, we, the fortunate, and the unfortunate might have been each other; an idea ennobled by the faith that our Nation can summon from its myriad diversity the deepest measure of unity; an idea infused with the conviction that America's long, heroic journey must go forever upward.And so, my fellow Americans, as we stand at the edge of the 21st century, let us begin anew with energy and hope, with faith and discipline.And let us work until our work is done.The Scripture says, And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.From this joyful mountaintop of celebration we hear a call to service in the valley.We have heard the trumpets.We have changed the guard.And now, each in our own way and with God's help, we must answer the call.Thank you, and God bless you all.",clinton
"Thank you very much.Thank you very much, Secretary Bentsen, other members of the Cabinet and distinguished Members of the House and Senate of both parties, and the business men and women and the bankers who are here today.I am in debt to many people in this room and throughout this country who raised to me in many ways, over the 16 months in which I was engaged in the campaign for the Presidency, the question of the credit crunch.From the beginnings of that campaign in New Hampshire, across the country to Illinois and Michigan, down to Florida, across to California, and in all points in between, I repeatedly ran into small business men and women, I repeatedly met bankers themselves who said they wished that something could be done to open up credit again to creditworthy loans, to generate jobs in the private sector.Today we are taking a step to speed the economic recovery that will increase jobs by increasing access to credit for the main engine of our economy, small and medium-sized businesses.At the same time, by strengthening our banking system, our plan will move us beyond the banking problems of the last decade.The initiative avoids the regulatory excess and duplication we've seen and focuses on real risks within our financial institutions and on fair lending, equal opportunity, and credit availability.Every day, small business is a big part of all of our lives.It's the coffee shop on the corner, the florist down the street, the stationery store that carries office supplies, the dry cleaner, the contractor who will remodel a kitchen.Many are businesses with fewer than 100 employees.Many more employ fewer than 20 people.But they keep communities and neighborhoods vibrant and vital.They are the industry in a cottage, in a garage, in a spare bedroom.They are downtown in every town, and sometimes they grow into very large enterprises indeed.Small business includes small farms, the agricultural community.Their contribution is evident every day on our tables.But it is much more.They are the cultivators of an essential part of our history, our heritage, our culture.Small business is also high tech, the industries of tomorrow, from computer software to communications, to biotechnology and environmental testing, all enterprises that create high-wage, high-skill jobs for Americans today, and they will be there tomorrow.And small business has been the route to a better life for immigrants who set up a family business, for men and women who save as they work for others until they can venture off on their own.Often a small business is actually an outgrowth of the global economy.As larger firms downsize to remain competitive, they contract out to smaller firms.And many talented people who once worked for large companies are now going off on their own to seize opportunities in smaller enterprises, building businesses for themselves.Owning one's own business is a cornerstone of the American dream, fortified by hard work, determination, and creativity.My first experience in life with business was in my grandfather's little grocery store.He was the symbol of hope and opportunity to many people with whom he dealt in many ways, 6 days a week at all hours of the day and night.Today's small businesses are a barometer of the economic recovery.And as the strength of this recovery has been diluted by the inability to create jobs, it is clear that it's largely because small companies are still having a hard time.If you look at this chart here, you can see the number of small business failures, just since 1985:119,000 in '85-'86; 118,000 the next year; 111,000 in the next 2-year period; but in '91-'92, almost 185,000 small business failures.These businesses have been hit especially hard by the recession and by a problem not of their own making that can be summarized by two fearsome but now well-worn words: credit crunch.Small companies are simply unable in too many cases to get loans from banks.And I want to show this&mdash;they turned it, and I didn't see&mdash;if you look here, the growth in commercial and industrial loans, '85-'86, in billions of dollars; and the last 2 years, down to a negative $36 billion.Now, if these businesses can't begin or expand or try new ventures, that means stagnation for our economy, lost opportunity, and sometimes ruin for entrepreneurs.Indeed, I've met business people in this country in the last year and a half who've never missed a payment on a loan and still had the loans canceled.These problems are America's problems.When small businesses aren't prospering, they create fewer jobs, and that means fewer jobs for America.If you look at this last chart, you will see the real essence of why this has turned out to be, so far, a jobless recovery.In '85-'86, there was a positive change in small business employment of 2.4 million; '87-'88, 2.8 million; '89-'90, 3.2 million; but down in '91-'92, 400,000.Now, in every year of the 1980's the Fortune 500 companies have reduced employment by several hundred thousand people a year in the United States.But all during the eighties that reduction was more than offset by the creation of new jobs in the small business sector, until the last couple of years.If you had to put in a sentence why this has been a jobless recovery, it's because small business job creation hasn't offset big business job losses.And that is the central challenge we face.As we take advantage of the incredible things going on now in the big and small business sector with productivity increases, with the aggregate indications that we're in an economic recovery, we have to look for ways, all of us together, to try to help to spur small business and medium-size business job growth so that we can put some jobs back into these impressive economic figures of the last quarter.Nearly two-thirds of all of our workers are employed by small businesses.And as I said, millions of jobs in the last decade were created by them, even as larger employers were downsizing, contracting out, or moving employment offshore.We cannot afford not to try to resume this trend in the 1990's.We know that if we create a reliable and secure system of credit for America's small businesses, they'll create jobs for Americans and profits for themselves.That's why we have offered incentives like investment tax credits for small employers, the new business capital gains tax, urban enterprise zones, and a network of small business community development banks.In our country you can become successful if you have a better idea that you can turn into reality.But that reality can only occur if credit is available, for most Americans.And we think we have a better idea for getting lenders and creditworthy borrowers together.What we propose does not involve any changes in legislation.These steps can be taken quickly because they have been agreed to already by the four Federal bank and thrift regulatory agencies: the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of Thrift Supervision.Today I'll outline the basics of the plan, but the four bank and thrift regulators are issuing a joint interagency policy statement today that sets out more of the details.It will be available to all of you, and most of you will understand it.With this plan our examiners will be directed to do what they do best and not to spend endless hours on pointless paperwork.It will strengthen our oversight by shifting our regulatory attention from unproductive and repetitive procedures, redirecting our resources to better use so that bank examiners will be able to seek out the real risks in today's environment.They'll go after bad loans and troubled banks.That means improved safety and soundness.But they will reduce the credit crunch because they will reduce attention to things that do not deserve them.We will not, I will say again, we will not reduce attention to important regulation or to proper reserves for problem loans.The plan will not lower the capital requirements established in accordance with international standards.It will not cause a single bank to fail.And it will not cost the deposit insurance funds one dollar.Through a proper allocation of our regulatory resources, we will be able to focus more on examination procedures to further meaningful compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act and to promote fair opportunities for all of our people while reducing the hassles for all creditworthy loans.Above all, borrowers can go to their banks expecting fair and equal treatment and a reasonable application process.Fairness is a goal for many good reasons, including the fact that women and other minorities have been very bullish for small business and for America.Female-owned companies now employ 11 1/2 million Americans.A side effect of the savings and loan disaster was a reaction that forced many banks into a thinking mode that didn't distinguish between a good risk and a bad risk where small businesses were concerned.They were afraid to.This was a problem, especially for community bankers who frequently had to decide whether they could loan money to other members in their own community.Even if a banker could personally vouch that an applicant was a person of good character with an unblemished credit record and a good business track record, a loan might still be turned down because the banker felt his hands were tied by tight restrictions.So while we ask bankers to give the small business men and women credit, we'll give the bankers some credit too, as they consider loans to small and medium-size companies in their own communities and neighborhoods.They'll be encouraged to use their judgment to determine whether a borrower is creditworthy.And we're telling bankers that as long as their institutions and their practices are sound, they shouldn't be afraid of the regulator.If they disagree with a decision by a regulator, they'll now have a recourse, a workable and prompt appeals process.To bankers across the Nation we say, you are a pillar of our neighborhoods and communities.We know the demands of rebounding from the last decade have often been painful for many of you.Your comeback has been nothing short of amazing.But there is more work to do.And we need you to get it done.And if it gets done, there will be something to show for it, the kind of broad-based economic growth that benefits all of us.And we further say to bankers across the land that if you make sensible loans, the Government should not come down on you.That's why we're taking this action today.We want bankers to get back into the business of lending money, and we're going to work with them to make it happen.We're also making clear that taking collateral as part of a business loan should not be so burdensome or costly to discourage borrowers or lenders from making sound credit decisions.Often the only collateral a would-be borrower can offer is real estate.Of course, we learned the hard way in the eighties that we had to be careful where loans involving commercial real estate are concerned.But care has been confused with regulatory excess that has been too much of a burden for everyone.The changes we propose will strike a balance so that we can have both safety and credit availability.These changes will also address the paper crunch in getting a small business loan.It simply shouldn't be as burdensome to get a $25,000 loan as it is to get a $25 million loan.It makes no sense for a small or medium-sized business borrower, or for an individual for that matter, to be required in every case to produce a pile of paper like this one&mdash;pretty thick&mdash;when a loan can be made safely in many cases, particularly by banks who have demonstrated judgment in their business practices, with merely a promissory note and a financial statement and possibly a short credit application like this.So under the current system, the paperwork-and I expect every one of you to come back and show me your measured envelopes here.We've got to prove that the difference is what we're asserting it is today.Streamlining the process will make it easier to free up credit without compromising security.This is action that everyone, conscientious regulators, community-conscious banks, and growing businesses, can embrace.With this approach we want to marry the ingredients for a thriving business climate.Right now banks are healthier than they've been in years; 1990 was a record year for bank profitability.And these profits have been used to put banks in the strongest position they've been in, in a quarter of a century.At the same time, interest rates have gone down.Just 3 years ago the average interest rate on a small business loan was 12 percent.So far the average is 8 percent.The climate for business ventures has been made even sunnier by economic growth that we've seen in the last quarter.That's a byproduct of the optimism for the growth that we are pressing for now with all the economic initiatives that are before the Congress and the country.So both supply and demand for business loans are there.And would-be small business owners are right to feel they have the wind at their backs.Now that we have banks in the strongest positions they've been in in a quarter century, they ought to be able to give us the strongest economic boost we've had for small business in a quarter century.Until now the problem has been that everyone has had to face a 10-foot wall called the credit crunch.This action that this administration is taking today should take a big chunk out of that wall.The result should be a flow of billions of dollars of economic stimulus that doesn't cost the American taxpayers one red cent.The payoff will be in new jobs and in reversing the charts that I have shown you today.At the same time, by encouraging new small business ventures, we'll be laying the groundwork for a smarter work force that can compete more effectively in the global economy.Getting financing to these businesses is absolutely essential to the future growth of America.We'll see the benefits, and so will our children.This administration is firmly and unequivocally committed to the private sector as the engine of economic growth in America.We have no illusions, no abstractions, no preoccupations; we know that this is what works in this country.In America we put people first, first by having a prosperous economy founded on a thriving private sector.What's good for America is good for business, and we are determined to make the climate for business and for growth better and better and better, beginning today where so many of you have told me for so long we ought to begin, with a real assault on the credit crunch.Thank you very much.",clinton
"Thank you very much.I want to say a special word of thanks to the people from Westinghouse who greeted me when I arrived: Gary Clark, who introduced me, Dick Linder, Gladys Green, Rich O'Leary, and Gary Eder.And thank you to all of you who made this tour possible.I want to thank the Members of the United States Congress who are here, who have worked very hard for a long time and before I became President to help to design a plan to strengthen our economy even as we reduce military spending.Your Senators, Barbara Mikulski and Paul Sarbanes, are here.Your Congressman, Ben Cardin, is here.Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico; Senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein of California; Senator Bill Cohen of Maine; Senator Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island; Congressman Martin Frost of Texas; Congresswoman Jane Harman of California; and Congressman Tom Foglietta of Pennsylvania.I think that is the entire delegation here, along with Mayor Kurt Schmoke of Baltimore and Governor Schaefer.I'm glad to see all of them.I have to note here, you can tell who the best politician is.Of all these people I've introduced, only Senator Mikulski found a seat.I want to thank all of them for their work.All of you know from personal experience how much American industry has been changed by the cutbacks in defense.Defense spending peaked in 1985.And by 1997, it will have been reduced approximately 40 percent, perhaps more, from its 1985 peak.These changes have led not only to reductions in military personnel abroad and closings of bases at home but dramatic changes in military contracting that have affected companies like this one and which have affected the economies of the States of California, Connecticut, Texas, and many others.It has been said that while change is certain, progress is not.And that certainly is true when it comes to the challenge of meeting the national economic goals that we have in the face of cutbacks in military spending.As I said, these cutbacks have been made since 1985; more are to come.They are essential in a world in which we need funds to be reinvested in the domestic economy and in which the security threats we meet today, while very serious, are different and clearly less expensive than those we faced when the Soviet Union and the United States faced each other across the Berlin Wall with the barriers of the cold war and the imminent prospect of nuclear war.So these changes had to come.But if we do nothing in the face of change, we have learned the hard way that we are its victims.If we take bold action, we can be the beneficiaries of change.All of you here at Westinghouse Electronic Systems Group are proof that you can make change your friend.In 1986, just 16 percent of the work done here was nondefense.Today, it's 27 percent.By 1995, half or more of your work will be nondefense.What you have done here is what I wish to do nationally: take some of the most talented people in the world who produce some of the most sophisticated military technology and put that to work in the civilian economy.The military surveillance technology I have seen here can now be used to help commercial airlines avoid wind shears.Military security technology can now be used to help police officers on the streets and in their patrol cars to be safer and to solve crimes and to find missing children more rapidly.State-of-the-art batteries is helping here to develop an electric car which may well provide an enormous opportunity for America to become more energy-independent and to dramatically reduce the pollution of our atmosphere, at a time when we have been reminded anew that there really is a hole in the ozone layer and there really are problems with unlimited emissions of CO2.Clearly, defense conversion can be done and can be done well, making change our friend and not our enemy.But in order to do it we must act, act decisively, act intelligently, and not simply react years after the cuts occur.Last year, when a candidate for President, I outlined a plan to create new jobs in the civilian economy.Anticipating this challenge, farsighted Members of Congress appropriated approximately $1.5 billion for defense conversion last year, including ideas that literally came from the minds and the efforts of some of the Members of Congress who are here with us today.They've demonstrated aggressiveness in adapting to change.But until today, in spite of that act, none of the money appropriated by Congress was released, and there was no comprehensive plan for what to do with it.Today I want to explain how we're going to put your money to work to put Americans to work and how we're planning for the future by investing in our people, encouraging our companies, and assisting our communities.Our first priority has to be investing in our people.Keep in mind, as you all know here, when the defense budget is reduced, that affects, obviously, contracts and therefore the jobs of people who work in the private sector.It also affects the size of the military force itself, the configuration of our defense forces abroad and here at home, and the people who will be affected by the reductions.Our defense reinvestment and conversion initiative will rededicate $375 million right away to help working people affected by defense reductions with employment services, job training, and transition assistance; $150 million of that will go to Government and employer-sponsored job training programs; $112 million will help members of the Guard and the Reserves make the transition to civilian life and to provide severance pay and health benefits to civilians who are leaving Government employment.There's also initiative to provide early retirement benefits for military personnel with 15 years of service or more, to start a new program to encourage them to put their skills to work in vital areas like teaching, law enforcement, environmental restoration, and health care.Under a provision offered by Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, any member of the military who is being mustered out with 15 years or more of service can go to work in law enforcement, for example, and earn a year of military retirement for every year they were in law enforcement, so that these people who have committed their lives to the service of our country and could not reasonably have known that this reduction would occur and would affect them can still earn their military retirement by serving their country here at home.We must also recognize the ripple effect of defense adjustment and target assistance to our communities.In 1993 alone, we will triple the budget of the Defense Department's Office of Economic Adjustment.The $30 million we've committed to this task will be invested in helping our communities find the tools and the expertise to adjust to the changed nature of their local economy.It will be an investment that pays off in the long-term.In addition, through the Commerce Department, we'll invest another $80 million in a revolving loan and grant program to directly and immediately aid communities hit hardest by defense cuts.Finally, the Secretary of Defense has assured me that he will do everything he can to speed the environmental cleanup on bases that are closed so that they can be turned over either to commercial purposes or to local government at the earliest possible time so that there will be a minimum loss of economic activity in areas where bases are closed.But all the worker training in the world and all the community assistance in the word will do no good if there are no jobs for those workers and no businesses for those communities.The private sector is the engine of lasting economic growth in our system, and therefore, our plan must help our companies to make these transitions to compete and to win.We seek to go beyond the debate of the past in which some thought Government alone could do everything and others claimed Government could do nothing.In this area there are two things Government can do to aid companies like this one: promote dual use research and promote civilian use of technology that was formerly developed for military purposes.That is what you have done here.We want to speed and expand that process all across the United States.One of the success stories of the cold war was the Defense Advanced Research Agency, or DARPA.DARPA helped keep America on the cutting edge of defense research.To meet the new challenges of the new world, we're giving DARPA a new mission and restoring its old name, because before 1972 that Agency was known simply as the Advanced Research Products Agency.By going back to that name and refocusing the Agency's efforts on dual use technologies, such as that which you have demonstrated to me here today, rather than strictly military applications, we'll be better able to integrate research to strengthen defense and to promote our economic security here at home.Starting now, this Agency, ARPA, will allocate more than $500 million to technology and industrial programs like the ones we've seen here today.We'll support industry-led consortia and dual use technologies and promote efforts to break through with commercial uses of formerly defense technologies.Programs will be selected on the basis of merit and will require matching funds from the corporations affected.We're even going to set up a toll-free number to attract good ideas from good companies.And you will like this.The number is 1-800-DUALUSE.The hot line will be hooked up tomorrow, so don't call today.It is a remarkable coalition of Agencies finally putting all the information together for defense technology conversion, reinvestment, and transition assistance.To further coordinate assistance, ARPA will work with four other Agencies, the ones I just mentioned.And we're going to have a series of regional outreach meetings all across this country, again, to try to mobilize other companies to get involved in this initiative so that they can save or create jobs instead of lose jobs in the face of defense reductions.We want Government-industry partnerships to help develop advanced materials.We want companies to form regional technology alliances so they can share information and develop new products and new markets.Our manufacturing extension programs will help bring state-of-the-art technology to companies in much the same way as the Agricultural Extension Service helped our farmers more than two generations ago begin to become the most productive in the world.And through the Small Business Innovation Research Program, we'll help small businesses in their efforts to develop dual use technology.But dual use technology is just the beginning.We have to explore also new opportunities in purely civilian technologies.This year alone, we'll invest $300 million in emerging nondefense technology.The Department of Energy will speed the transfer of technology to private industry from our national labs.And when Congress passes the stimulus package I have proposed, we'll have millions more to invest in research and development partnerships, in advanced technology programs, and in computer networks for schools and libraries around the country.As with every aspect of the program for change I have asked the American people and the Congress to embrace, defense conversion will require us to literally reimagine and reinvent the way Government works.I've asked the National Economic Council to take the lead in our efforts to streamline and coordinate our conversion efforts so that you don't have to deal with a big bureaucracy where all the information is in many different places and sometimes seems to be operating at cross purposes.Shifting to a civilian economy is of obvious concern to the Defense Department, but it's also the business of the Commerce Department, the Labor Department, the Energy Department, NASA, and many other agencies, including the Department of Veterans Affairs, which will have even more veterans now as people are coming out of the service and going into the civilian work force.Our National Economic Council will cut through red tape, break through turf battles, and help to deliver services to our customers quickly and efficiently.I don't pretend that this will be easy, and all of it will take some time.But the choice we face is between bold action to build a stronger and safer and smarter America, or continuing to cut defense with no appropriate response or with one that is too localized and too limited.The soldier-statesman Dwight Eisenhower once observed that the resourceful American makers of plowshares could, with time and as required, make swords as well.Our challenge is now to reverse the process.You have given us a stunning example of just how brilliantly that can be done here in this fine facility.I know today that the world's finest makers of swords can and will be the finest makers of plowshares, and they will lead America into a new century of strength, growth, and opportunity.Thank you very much.",clinton
"Until that issue is resolved, questions remain about how United States economic and social policies should apply to the citizens of Puerto Rico.Further, although our citizens in Puerto Rico have been granted the exercise of authority on local matters similar to that of citizens of a State, they do not have voting representation in the Federal Government.All three of Puerto Rico's major political parties are based on different visions of what the options for a fully democratic status are, and what the best status would be.And all advocate a substantial change in the islands' status.The Commonwealth held a referendum on options for its future status in December 1998, including the current governing arrangement, and other recognized options, but a majority of the vote was for a None of the Above column.Much of the debate on the issue concerns what options are available to Puerto Rico, in light of the Constitution and the basic laws and policies of the United States.The elected representatives of the people of Puerto Rico have, therefore, repeatedly petitioned the Federal Government to clarify the islands' status options as well as the process by which Puerto Ricans can determine the islands' future status.The United States has a responsibility to answer such questions.Successive Presidents, and the Congress in 1998, have supported the people of Puerto Rico in determining their status preference from among options that are not incompatible with the Constitution and basic laws and policies of the United States.I have made it the policy of the executive branch to work with the leaders of the Commonwealth and the Congress to enable Puerto Ricans to choose their future status.We also have the responsibility to help Puerto Ricans obtain the necessary transitional legislation toward a new status, if chosen.The Co-Chairs of the President's Task Force shall conduct an ongoing dialogue with the Governor and Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico's major political parties and other groups that advocate a change in the islands' status, and the Chairs and Ranking Minority Members of the House of Representatives Committee on Resources and the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.This dialogue shall focus on the options for Puerto Rico's future status and the process by which Puerto Ricans can realize such an option.It shall seek to facilitate communications among the offices that the aforementioned officials represent on matters relating to the status of the Commonwealth, and ensure official attention to, and facilitate action on, such matters.In particular, the dialogue shall seek to clarify the options for Puerto Rico's future status and enable Puerto Ricans to choose among those options.2.The Co-Chairs of the President's Task Force shall monitor the expenditure of funds for public education on and a public choice among Puerto Rico's status options pursuant to Public Law 106-346.This monitoring shall include ensuring that educational materials are accurate, objective, and nonpartisan and that they are consistent with the standards set forth in the Executive Order entitled Establishment of the President's Task Force on Puerto Rico's Status.3.The heads of executive departments and agencies shall cooperate with the Co-Chairs in fulfilling the assignments provided for herein and in the accompanying Executive Order.",clinton
"Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, distinguished members of the Children's Defense Fund board, Secretary Reich, and Secretary Riley.I pushed him through the door so I could get a laugh out of it.I will say this: I know a lot of people will come here and tell you how much they appreciate people who are children's advocates.Not very many people appreciate it enough to marry one, and I did.My wife had to resign because she was married to a Presidential candidate.I am delighted to be here.I look out on this crowd and I see many old friends.You know, a lot of people ask me what it's like to be President.And I don't know if I can explain it, but it is different.People either want to walk around on tippy-toe or take a baseball bat and whack your head off.There seems to be nothing in between.The other day Hillary had a number of people into the White House on the first floor to some sort of meeting, and I got off on the floor, and I had to go someplace else.And all of a sudden, all these people were there.And I walked out into this crowd, and I started shaking their hands.And the guy who was with me said, Oh, Mr.President, I'm so sorry that you had to deal with all those people.I said, That's all right, I used to be one.Meanwhile, I'm going to depend on you and the American people to keep me just as close to humanity as I possibly can.I've just come from a remarkable event in Maryland with a number of Members of the Congress who are friends of the Children's Defense Fund.We were there; Secretary Reich was there with me; we flew back.And we were at a plant that belongs to Westinghouse.It used to be a defense plant, and it is increasingly becoming a domestic technology plant.And we went there to announce an economic conversion program to try to help more people who are losing their jobs from military cutbacks either in the private or the public sector find new opportunities moving toward the economy of the 21st century.This is a very important thing.We've been reducing defense since 1985, and no nation would so reduce one sector of its economy that provided so many high-wage, high-growth jobs, that was on the cutting edge of new technology-no other nation would ever have done what we've done with no clear strategy for what to do with all those resources, all those people, to try to help to build our economic base.So we will continue to reduce defense, as we must, but we're trying to plan for the future of those people and those incredible resources.I saw military technology turn into an electric car that will drive over 80 miles an hour and which may hold the promise of ending our dependence on foreign oil and cleaning up our atmosphere.I saw a police car with a computer screen with visual imaging developed for defense technology, which can now be used immediately to transmit to police officers who have it pictures of missing children, immediately, while they're in their car.I saw a plane with radar technology which just came back from dealing with the difficult incident in Waco, Texas&mdash;defense technology&mdash;another plane with a different sort of technology now which can be put on all of our commercial air flights to detect wind shears, which is one of the major causes of airline misfortunes now among commercial airlines.I say all this because everybody says, well, that's a great idea, and it's self-evident, and why haven't we been doing this? But it is simply reflective of a problem we have had in this country for some time, which is that we have undervalued the importance of increasing the capacity of our people.We have talked a lot about a lot of things in America.But when you strip it all away and you look at where we have been, sort of out of sync with many other countries and with where we have to go in the future, it is clear that on a broad range of areas, we have simply undervalued the importance of making a commitment to the idea that we don't have a person to waste, that everybody counts, and that what you can do affects not only your future but mine as well.These, of course, are the arguments that the Children's Defense Fund has been making since its inception in its struggles to get a better deal for America's children.They have become far more important arguments in the last decade.In 1985 a remarkable thing happened, a thing altogether laudatory in our country: Our senior citizens became less poor than the rest of us, a thing we can be proud of.People used to have to live in absolute agony wondering what would happen to their parents.You still do if you have long-term care problems.But most elderly people now, because of Social Security and supplemental security income and Medicare and because of the pension reforms of the last several years, can look forward to a security in their later years that 10 or 20 or 30 years ago was utterly unheard of.And it is really a testimony to the farsightedness of our country.However, at the same time, in the same decade, we began to experience a new class of poor people who were dramatically undervalued.They were little children and their poor parents, usually their single poor parents.And they had no advocates in many councils of power.If it hadn't been for the Children's Defense Fund and a few others who walked with them through life, many of the good things which have been done would not have been done.And all the things which were done were not enough to reverse the trends of the 1980's, when the elderly became less poor and the children became more poor.Now, because many of you in this room have continued this fight, and because of the decisions the American people made in the last election, we once again have a chance to invest in the hopes and the dreams of our children.I have asked the United States Congress to embrace a program that recognizes, as was said earlier, that we have two big deficits in this country.We have a huge budget deficit, but we also have a huge investment deficit.It was a cruel irony of the last 12 years that we not only took the Government debt from $1 trillion to $4 trillion, with annual deficits now in excess of $300 million projected for the next few years unless we change it, but we found a way in all of that to actually reduce our investment in our future at the national level.How could it happen? Well, it happened because of a big military buildup.It happened because of a big tax cut early.It happened because health care costs have been completely out of control.It happened because an underperforming economy didn't produce many revenues.So you have all these anomalies.The United States, the world's strongest economy, has the third worst record in the Western Hemisphere for immunizing its children against preventable childhood diseases.The United States, a country that has dominated the economy of the world for the last half a century, has higher rates of adult illiteracy and school dropout and dysfunction among adults than most of its major competitors, and the highest rate of incarceration of any country in the world, something we rank first in.That bespeaks our inability to make the diversity of our country a source of strength instead of weakness, and to deal with the stark dilemmas of poverty in ways that at least give the children a chance to do better.Well, now we have a chance.The good news is we know a lot about what works.We've known for years through clear studies that, though not perfect, Head Start and WIC and immunizations really do make a difference.We know that if you give children a better life and you strengthen their families, you make the economy stronger and you free up money to be spent on things like that economic conversion program I just visited today.We know that if we focus on people and their capacities, it really does work.That's why I was really pleased that the first bill I signed was the Family and Medical Leave Act because it will, even to those who oppose it, make their businesses more productive, not less, by securing family life and making it possible for people to be good parents.That's why the long-term economic plan and the short-term economic stimulus I asked the Congress to embrace includes funds to put our people first: for 700,000 summer jobs for young people; for the beginnings of summer Head Start programs where they don't exist; for beginning to set up the infrastructure of immunization where it isn't, so that we can start to do the work that has to be done.We have simply got to invest in our people in ways that work.Marian has already said it, but I will reiterate.This budget, if funded by the Congress, will fully fund Head Start and WIC, will create a network of immunization efforts which will permit us to finally immunize our little children against preventable childhood diseases, something that will save, over the long run, 10 bucks for every dollar we put into it.How do you explain, I mean, how can you possibly justify to anybody that our country, with the power of its economy, that produces the vast majority of vaccines produced anywhere in the world, is better only than Bolivia and Haiti in this hemisphere in immunizing our children? And you know, you have to have a certain core of immunization to make sure that there will be no outbreak of diseases.We are dangerously, perilously close to falling below that core of immunized children in many different areas.This is a big deal, folks.So I hope that we will have this attitude now that we ought to invest as we cut the deficit.The plan that I presented to the Congress reduces the deficit dramatically, has 150 specific budget cuts, starts with an example from the White House staff.We cut the staff in the next fiscal year 25 percent below the staffing levels that I found when I came.We cut $9 billion out of the administrative costs of Federal agencies.And I mean they're real cuts; they're going into the budget.They cannot be escaped.I know better.I saw the proof of an article by David Stockman coming out in a magazine soon which talked about how the clear problem is that the tax base of this country was dramatically, fundamentally, and permanently eroded in 1981, that Social Security's about the same percentage of gross national product today it was back in 1981.So we have to raise some more money if we want to reduce the debt.But we also try to reverse the investment gap in things that you didn't come here to talk about, like transportation and clean water and better sewage systems, in things that will strengthen the environment and put people to work and increase our productivity, in things like community development operations to add jobs to high unemployment areas, in national service, which Marian mentioned, and in other areas that will increase the capacity of people to work, to grow, to learn, to flourish.Now, to be fair to those people, there are basically three lines of attack.You're going to the Hill.I want you to know I need your help.I need your help because there are a lot of people without jobs; there are a lot of people without adequate jobs.Most of the new jobs created in this last round&mdash;365,000 last month-hallelujah, that's great, but more than half of them were part-time jobs that don't have health care benefits for the kids and the families.You need to know what they are saying, the people against whom you must argue.They will say, number one, We can cut the deficit even more if we just didn't have any investment, or If we didn't pass any of the President's spending programs, we could cut the deficit as much and raise taxes less.The problem with that argument is those people think there is absolutely no difference between putting another child in Head Start and keeping somebody working in an agency when the job is no longer needed and can be phased out, in supporting a regulatory apparatus that bas long since lost its justification, in funding a pork barrel project that can't possibly be justified.In other words, these people think anything the Government spends is equally bad.Educating a kid to go to college is the same as continuing the subsidy for sheep or any other program; no difference.Government spending is Government spending is Government spending.There is no difference.Now, do you believe that in your own lives?Audience members.No-o-o! No.I mean, in your lives, if you take home a check every month, is it the same whether you spend it on making a house payment, making a car payment, saving money for your child's education, or just paying for an extra helping at dinner? Of course not.There are distinctions in the relative impact of how you spend your pay, how your business invests its money, and how your Government invests your money.And so when people tell you there's no difference, tell them that's wrong.And then there is a crowd that say, Well, these programs don't really make any difference.Head Start doesn't work, and there's no proof Head Start works.Now, this is an interesting argument.Most of those who think there's no proof Head Start works still believe trickle-down economics did.Until I proposed phasing in the full funding of this program, many of those who themselves objected had previously voted to expand it.To be fair, President Bush praised Head Start at every turn.A few years ago, Senator Dole introduced his own legislation to expand it.Sure, there are serious criticisms rooted in the fact that this is now not a new program.There are people who say it's not evenly good across the country.That is true.There are people who say it could be managed better.That's true.There are people who say that cognitive improvements don't always last more than 2 years after children stop attending, depending on where they are.That's true.One big deal is how strong the parents' involvement really is.There are those who say there ought to be more school-based programs or more home-based programs, and we've worked hard on that at home.All that's true.That is not an excuse not to fully fund Head Start.Our program will serve more children, but it will also strengthen the quality of Head Start and put some flexibility back into the program so that it can meet the needs of the different communities that are served.But those who choose to ignore the overwhelming evidence of the program's success have an obligation to tell us why more children with high self-esteem and better grades and better thinking skills and better predictable long-term performance is such a bad idea.I think it's a great idea.But we must, in fairness to the criticisms, become our own most severe critics.That's where you come in, because all of you live out there where these programs work.You could give a better criticism of what's wrong with most of these public programs than those who don't want to fund them.Most of you could.So tell them you know it is up to us to be our own most severe critics.I just asked the Vice President to review every program in the Government, come back to me in 6 months with all kinds of other things that we can stop doing or that we can modify or that we can push back to people at the grass roots level.If we who believe in Government don't have the courage to change it, we cannot expect those who don't to help us in our efforts.And this is just the beginning.Just 2 days ago I asked Secretary Shalala to draft a new child welfare initiative to combine family support and family preservation services, to do more to build on the work of Senator Rockefeller and Congressman Matsui and Congresswoman Schroeder and to do more for families at risk, especially those at risk of foster care placement, even as we try to strengthen our efforts to enforce child support enforcement for those who have been abandoned by one parent.Now, there is a third argument against this effort.There are those who say, Yes, Head Start's a good deal; WIC is a good deal; the immunization's a good deal.And yes, we ought to invest as opposed to consume.There is a distinction to be drawn in the way this money is spent, and investment is better, investment in our children, our fixture.But we still ought not to do it because we need even more deficit reduction.And let me say, that is an argument you must treat with respect.We have gone from a $1 trillion deficit to a $4 trillion deficit in 12 years.We have imposed a crushing burden on the present and a bigger one on the future.And if you think about it, it's really an income transfer.Now that we're spending 15 cents of every dollar you pay the Government&mdash;most of you are middle class people, and we spend 15 cents of every dollar you pay the Government paying interest on the debt.Those bonds are largely held by Upper income people.So there are now a lot of liberals in the Congress who are rethinking their old positions on things like the mechanisms by which we move to balance the budget on the theory that we're spending all this money having an income transfer from middle class taxpayers, lower income taxpayers to people who hold the bonds because we didn't have the discipline to run our budgets better.And if we don't do something about the deficit, we just keep on spending like we are, by the end of the decade your annual debt will be $653 billion a year.The interest service will be about 22 cents of your tax dollar.Twenty cents on the dollar of every dollar in America, public and private, will go to health care.So we have to change.But my answer to those who say, Well, let's just don't invest because this deficit is such a big problem, is: Number one, we got into this mess over 12 years, and we have more than 4 years to get out of it.Number two, we are reaping the benefits of the clear and disciplined and determined effort that the congressional leadership has now agreed to make with me to bring the deficit down.We have interest rates at very, very low rates.We have the stock market back up.People say, Hey, this thing is going to work.All of you can now look at whether you should refinance your home or your car.Businesses should refinance their debt.If we get all this debt refinanced in the next year, that will add $80 to $100 billion back in our economy.We are reaping the benefits of a disciplined program to reduce the deficit today.But if we do not also at the same time recognize that for 12 years we have ignored our obligations to invest in our jobs, in our people, in our education, if we don't do that, we will pay for that neglect tomorrow, just like we're paying for yesterday's neglect today.We can do both things.There's another argument you need to make&mdash;and I'm speaking for my wife now, as well as for me which is that if you just cut out all these programs that we believe in, if you just cut them plumb out, you'll still have an increase in the deficit again, starting in about 5 years, because of the explosion in health care costs.The real, ultimate answer to the deficit problem is to bring health care cost in line with inflation and provide a decent system of health care for all Americans.And we can do that.So, with discipline, with a willingness to both cut and tax, with a willingness to reduce consumption expenditures and increase investment in our future, we can do the things that we have to do.But we can't walk away from any of our challenges and expect the results America needs.If we walk away from the health care challenge, it doesn't matter what they do on all these other cuts.You'll be swallowed up in debt in 5 or 6 years again if we walk away from the health care challenge.If we walk away from the challenge to raise some more revenues and cut the spending we must, we'll lose control of our economic destiny even if we spend more money on the programs you want.You'll be raising and educating healthier, more well-educated kids to a weaker economy.But if we reduce the deficit and we forget about the fact that in the world we live in the only thing that really counts is people&mdash;every factory can be moved overseas.Three trillion dollars in money crosses national lines every day.Everything else is mobile except us.We're here.We don't want to move.That's what we've got.And if we ignore that, we don't think those little kids that live in the Mississippi Delta, in my home State, many of whom never see a dentist the whole time of their childhood, need a better shot in life because of us as well as them; if we don't believe that those kids that are sitting out there in the barrios in Los Angeles, in the black community, in the Hispanic community, in the Asian-American community, waiting for the resolution of the Rodney King trial only because it stands for everything else that ever happened to them, not because of the trial but because of what it stands for; if we don't think that we need to prove that a county like Los Angeles County with people from 150 different racial and ethnic groups can live together and learn together and grow together and if they play by the rules can have the right to earn a decent living, and we don't think that affects the rest of us, we haven't learned very much in the last 12 years.And so I ask you to do this: I ask you to go to the Congress and ask them to support this program.And go with respect, because I promise you most of these people are trying to come to grips with the dilemmas of this time.And they have gotten one big message: that is that we made a horrible mistake to let the deficit get out of hand like we did in the last 12 years.And they deserve respect for getting that message.And they now have a President who will take the lead and fade some of the heat for the unpopularity of the decisions which have to be made.Go with respect for that.Say, You had to do that, and we respect that.But remind them that out in the country where you live, bringing down the deficit is important if it gives people jobs and raises people's incomes and if there are people out there who can seize the opportunities of the future.And what you represent is the future.You represent the needs of the people who will not be able to perform even with a sensible economic policy unless we do better in health care, in education, and in dealing with the needs of our poorest children.That is what you represent.None of this other stuff will amount to a hill of beans unless we put the American people first in all of these decisions.That is the message I plead with you to bring to the Congress.Thank you, and God bless you all.",clinton
"Thank you very much.Please be seated.We are honored here in the White House to be joined today by distinguished Members of the Senate and the House: Senator Biden, Senator Hatch, Senator Kennedy, Senator Sarbanes, one of Janet Reno's Senators, Senator Connie Mack.Senator Graham called me last night.He's in Florida today with the First Lady at a health care hearing.And he said he had an excused absence from the Attorney General.I also would say we're delighted to be joined by Mr.Justice White and Mrs.White.Thank you very much for coming.Let me say that it is a great honor for me to be able to be here at this ceremony today with Janet Reno, her family, and a few of her many friends.I'd like to say a special word of thanks to Stuart Gerson, who has served ably and honorably as Acting Attorney General since the Inauguration.I think we owe him a round of applause.I especially want to thank Senator Biden and Senator Hatch and the members of the Judiciary Committee for waiving the normal waiting period between hearings and the confirmation vote, making this event possible today and making it possible for us to proceed immediately with the urgent tasks at hand.But more than anything else, I think it is clear that Janet Reno made her own swift confirmation possible, showing the Senate and all who followed the hearings the qualities of leadership and integrity, intelligence, and humanity that those gathered in this room have recognized for a very long time.You shared with us the life-shaping stories of your family and career that formed your deep sense of fairness and your unwavering drive to help others to do better.You showed us that your career in public service, working on the front lines in your community, fighting crime, understanding the impact on victims and on neighborhoods, mending the gritty social fabric of a vibrant but troubled urban area, is excellent preparation for carrying forward the banner of justice for all the American people.You'll help to guide the Federal Government to assist State and local law enforcement in ways that really count.You demonstrated that you will be a formidable advocate for the vulnerable people in our society and especially for our children.Most of all, you proved to the Nation that you are a strong and an independent person who will give me your best legal judgment whether or not it's what I want to hear.That is the condition upon which you accepted my nomination and the only kind of Attorney General that I would want serving in this Cabinet.As Janet Reno begins her work at the Justice Department, she will enter a building that symbolizes our Nation's commitment to justice, to equality, to the enforcement of our laws.On the side of that building, carved above one of the portals, is the inscription, The halls of justice are a hallowed place.With Janet Reno serving as our Nation's Attorney General, those words will have great meaning for all Americans.",clinton
"Good day, ladies and gentlemen.On this St.We both share a love of music and a love of Ireland, and I'm looking forward to working with him in the years ahead.I accept with honor this beautiful bowl of shamrocks he has presented from the people of Ireland to the people of the United States.And it will be proudly displayed in the White House as a symbol of our shared values and common heritage.The Prime Minister's visit is an opportunity not only to recall our kinship but also to work together on issues of critical importance to both our nations.We just concluded a good meeting which covered many issues, and I benefited greatly from the Prime Minister's advice and counsel.We discussed the importance of bringing the Uruguay round to a successful conclusion.We reviewed the humanitarian relief effort in Somalia, including the generous contributions of Irish citizens working in such organizations as CONCERN and UNICEF.Let me take a moment here, Mr.Prime Minister, to extend to the families and friends of Valerie Place and Sean Devereux the heartfelt condolences of the American people over their tragic deaths and our gratitude for their service.Their dedication to the relief efforts in Somalia will serve as an inspiration to us as we seek to extend the hand of comfort to victims of strife.The Prime Minister and I also discussed the continuing tragic conflict in Northern Ireland that has cost 3,000 lives over the last 2 decades.I congratulate both the Irish and the British Governments for their joint efforts to promote the necessary dialog to bring about a just and lasting peace.And I want to underscore my strong support for that important goal.We agree that such an outcome cannot be coerced or imposed, and that those who resort to violence must not be tolerated.Violence condemns generation to harvest the seeds of bitterness, not peace.Nor can the problem be resolved by the language of victories or defeats.It must be resolved in the language and spirit of compromise and conciliation.I told the Prime Minister that the United States stands ready to do whatever we can to help in bringing peace to Northern Ireland.We are a nation of diversity.We are prepared to help in any way that we can.I think that it is important to say that the most significant thing I should be doing now is to encourage the resumption of the dialog between the Irish and the British Governments, which I think is a critical precondition to any establishment of a lasting peace.Our support for the International Fund for Ireland is an important demonstration of our commitment to encourage investment and economic growth and to advance the cause of peace and tolerance.My discussions with Prime Minister Reynolds, as with Prime Minister Major, were the first of many that I think you will see our governments having as we offer our assistance in trying to end the troubles.Let me close by saying that the ties of culture, history, and friendship between the United States and Ireland mean a great deal to me.Last night the Prime Minister and I joined together in singing When Irish Eyes Are Smiling.He did a slightly better job than I did.Let me add that Ireland will have a friend in The White House, Mr.Prime Minister, not just on St.Patrick's Day but on every day of the year.I also want to take advantage of the Prime Minister's visit here to announce my intention to nominate as Ambassador to Ireland a distinguished individual, as Irish as Americans can be, Jean Kennedy Smith.I can think of no one who better captures the bonds between Ireland and the United States or who will work harder to advance our relationship.In many ways she's already been an unofficial international ambassador.Since she founded Very Special Arts two decades ago, she has traveled tirelessly throughout the United States and the world.Very Special Arts provides opportunities for the disabled in creative arts in all 50 States and over 50 countries, including Ireland.As a testament to her success, a play from her young playwrights program in Dublin will open shortly off Broadway.I know firsthand Jean's achievements from the Arkansas Very Special Arts program and remember well when Hillary joined her in our State for the competition to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the White House.The people of the United States will be proud of our new Ambassador.I am proud of her, and I'm glad to have a couple of her relatives, the Senator from the State of Massachusetts and Congressman Kennedy, to join with us today.And Mr.Ambassador, let me say again how very grateful we are to you and offer you the opportunity to make a few remarks and then offer Mrs.Smith.Ambassador-Designate Smith.Thank you very much.It is a great honor for me to be nominated as Ambassador to Ireland.And I'm extremely grateful to President Clinton for his confidence in me.I will do all I can to repay this confidence.It's a wonderful St.Patrick's Day.Thank you.Prime Minister Reynolds.Thank you, President.Ambassador to Ireland.The U.S.is proud of her.We are more proud still to welcome home Jean Kennedy Smith.She has been a regular visitor to our shores.She has done marvelous work throughout the world, as the President has just said, in relation to her work for the disabled arts.And I know she'll get plenty of opportunity to continue that creative work in Ireland.Thank you, President.St.Patrick's Day, Mr.President, is an occasion which bonds and brings together our two communities and peoples in a uniquely meaningful way.It is not simply about shamrock and symbols, important though these are; rather does it have as its core a deep, abiding, and shared belief in democracy and freedom and in the protection and extension of human rights.It was because these values were incorporated in the foundation of the American republic that Thomas Jefferson could proclaim in his first Inaugural Address what might then have seemed a paradox, and I quote: I believe this ...the strongest Government on earth.It is a day and this is a unique occasion, standing as we are here in the house which, as President Clinton remarked last night at that very enjoyable function, that this house was designed just over 200 years ago by an Irishman, James Hoban.That's one of the reasons why we are contemplating the extraordinary success of Irish America.You will have no difficulty, Mr.President, if on this day I characterize you, you yourself, as reflecting on that Irish American success story.Like John F.Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, Andrew Jackson, Ulysses S.Grant, and other Presidents of Irish extraction before you, you have risen to the highest position in the land adopted by your ancestors and demonstrated again that the great American dream which inspired so many of your forbears is alive and well and in very good hands.The success story that is Irish America today began as one of political, economic, and social struggle in the home country.It should not be surprising therefore that when the earlier waves of our immigrants reached these shores, they were to the forefront in the American War of Independence and in the drafting and promulgation of the American Declaration of Independence, and that later waves of immigrants quickly and enthusiastically embraced that declaration, to quote just one historian, not as a tired formula, but as an ideal to be reached out for and grasped.It is against that background, Mr.President, that I have always believed that the constructive interest and support of the United States has the potential to be uniquely helpful in finding a solution to the situation in Northern Ireland, that last residual problem of a long and often sad history between Ireland and Britain.My government are determined not to allow another generation to suffer the scourge and savagery of violence or its demeaning and related manifestations: disadvantage, harassment, and discrimination.There are no immediate answers, no simple solutions, but there is a way forward.It involves courage, commitment, and imagination.It will require, above all, the letting go of all vestiges of triumphalism on every side and replacing it with a willingness and a determination to work together in partnership within new structures which will embrace and seek to reconcile the two conflicting rights and aspirations in our small country.We warmly welcome your concern, Mr.President, your commitment, and your active support as we take on this daunting but vital challenge.If we can succeed, Mr.President, in establishing in Ireland structures that achieve these goals, the benefits may not just be for Ireland alone.In a world where deeper ethnic divisions have assumed a new and violent prominence, it may well be that the model we create in Ireland will have application in similar conflict situations around the world.So in conclusion, Mr.President, may I thank you again for the hospitable American reception you have given us here today at the White House.In so doing, you acknowledge and honor the contribution of the millions of fellow Irish who have made their homes and built their dreams in this great land.You make us all proud.As we travel together now for a gathering on Capitol Hill hosted by another outstanding Irishman, Speaker Foley, may I extend to you, Mrs.Clinton, and your family our warmest best wishes on this very special day for all of us and convey our sincerest wish for the success of your administration.I hope Americans of all ethnic backgrounds have a wonderful St.Patrick's Day.And what a day in which to celebrate it here with one of us as President, another, Albert here on my right, and the Kennedy family that are a legend in Ireland, the United States, and throughout the world.That was such an outstanding performance, I think the Prime Minister should have to answer all the questions.President, whether or not to send a peace envoy or to send a fact-finding mission to Northern Ireland? And could you give us some idea of a time frame for that action, please? No, I discussed it with the Prime Minister.And we decided after our consultations that that is certainly an option that I should leave open, both of those options, and have under serious consideration.As you know, talks began last year and then were suspended.I'm very hope fid that the British and the Irish Governments will get back together and begin a serious dialog soon.I think that is a precondition, as I said, for the other talks proceeding.And I'm going to stay in touch closely with Prime Minister Reynolds.We're going to talk frequently, and I expect to have an Ambassador in Ireland pretty soon.And I'll make those decisions at what seems to me to be the appropriate time.I have not made them now, and I don't think it would be appropriate to make a final decision on that at this time.I think we had a very long and fruitful discussion, both the President and myself.I gave him a fairly quick synopsis of the whole situation: the relationship between the two Governments that are excellent, between Dublin and London; the talks that took place last year; the progress that was made there; the suspension of the talks.And I think the objective of both of us, and indeed, the British Government included, would be to get those talks resumed at an earlier stage.We fully appreciate the keen interest and support of President Clinton in this regard and of his burning desire to have those talks recommenced.And he will keep in close consultation with all parties concerned so that we can get those talks resumed at the earliest possible date.As you have heard, the President just confirmed that both of those options are left open, and he will consult widely in the days and weeks and months ahead in relation to that.At the end of the day, it will be his decision.President, have you taken on board the unionists' concerns about&mdash;in Northern Ireland&mdash;the suggestions that you might send somebody who would attempt to mediate the peace situation? President Clinton.Well, I don't think the United States can make peace in Northern Ireland, and I don't think that the unionists, the nationalists, anyone else would expect that.I think that we have a deep concern about the future of Ireland.We have a deep concern about ending the violence and the abuses of humanity which have been there.And I want to do whatever I can to support that process.I do believe, I'll say again, I do believe that the dialog that was opened not all that long ago between these two Governments in Ireland and Great Britain offer the real chance of producing a framework within which peace could occur.And I am going to continue to stay on top of the situation, involved in it.I'll make those decisions at a later time when I think they are appropriate.I think it is inappropriate now for me to do more than just to say that I think the Governments should in earnest embrace the opportunities that are before them.And I will be as supportive as I can.And whenever there seems to be something else I eau do by taking further action, then I will do it.I don't want to do anything to undermine the peace process.I want to do something that will support it and reinforce it.President, what about Secretary Aspin's health? Do you have to now consider, at least consider, baring a new Secretary of Defense? No, people get pacemakers all the time.No.As far as I know he's just doing fine.Thank you.It was a difficult decision for that reason.I think he's one of the best mayors to serve in the United States in my lifetime.And he was willing to serve, and I want him in the administration.Thank you.",clinton
"Last night I went to bed early&mdash;at 1:15 a.m.-for you, and I was taking odds on how many of you would actually be here this morning at 8:30 a.m.Speaker, a special word of thanks, and in his absence, to Mr.Gephardt, to whom I talked last night sometime after midnight.I want to thank you, David Bonior, for your work.And I want to say a special word of thanks for the southern-drawled discipline of Butler Derrick, the fine job he did.I love to listen to Butler talk.He makes me sound like a Yankee.Natcher and Mr.Sabo, for the work they did.And I want to thank, of course, most of all, all of you for what you did yesterday.And I want to thank your constituents, the people who made this possible.If it hadn't been for the American people voting for a change in direction in this country, communicating that to you, and telling you that they would stay behind you if you made the tough decisions, none of this would have been possible.Yesterday was a great day of victory for ordinary Americans and for the proposition that this Government can work for them again, that we don't have to be mired in gridlock, that we don't have to spend all of our time posturing and dividing and running for cover instead of moving into the future.It was a wonderful beginning.I think it's important to remember that it's just a beginning, that you now have to encourage your colleagues on the other side of the Capitol to act and that we all have to continue to stay in touch with the people who sent us here.When I leave you today, I'm going to Atlanta to try to continue my dialog with the American people and to say we still have a great deal of work to do to create the jobs and invest in our people and reduce the deficit.But people know that it's working.You know, this last week I have had to take a good deal of time off to deal with the foreign policy responsibilities of the President.But one of the most interesting things that happened during the last week is that every world leader with whom I met at some point during the conversation said that America seems to be on the move again, that it's exciting to see so much happening here.We are looking forward, the Vice President and I and all of our family, to working with you as we complete this work.This can be a historic year for this country.You acted with unbelievable dispatch.I don't think that a budget resolution has ever been passed so quickly and one has ever been this comprehensive and acted on this quickly.It is a wonderful beginning but is just the beginning.And let's, all of us, determine that we're not going to quit until our job is done.Let's urge the people, as I said, in the Senate to join hands with us and move forward quickly now.And let's stay in touch with the folks back home and tell them what we're really doing is giving the Government back to them.Thank you very much, and God bless you.",clinton
"Let me say, as all of you know, I received a letter not long ago from Justice White expressing his intention to resign from the Court at the end of this term and saying that be wanted to give me this much notice so that hopefully I could announce my intention to nominate someone and all the hearings could be concluded in time to really prepare someone to serve at the beginning of the October term of the Court.I called Justice White just a few moments ago and had a fine conversation with him.I've known him for nearly 20 years, and I thanked him for his service to our country.He's had a truly remarkable life.And I appreciate the fact that he cared enough about the Court as an institution to offer me a significant period of time to deliberate and still to have plenty of time to have a nominee considered by the Senate and then confirmed well in advance of the beginning of the Court's next term.So I will begin work on this tomorrow in earnest.and I will attempt to be faithful to my Constitutional duties and appoint a truly outstanding American in a timely fashion.I don't want to get into personalities now.This is Mr.Justice White's day.And as I said, I never will forget sitting in the Supreme Court as a young attorney general and having had him already tell me that the quality of representation by the States was pretty poor.And then I had worked very hard with a lawyer from my State who was making the argument, and he sent me a note, which I still have in my personal files 16 years later, saying that we were doing better.So that's what I'm going to try to do every day.The list may get longer; it may get shorter.I did not anticipate having the opportunity to make an appointment at this early stage, so we don't have a big bank of potential nominees.I'll go to work on it tomorrow.I don't want to discuss any individuals at this point.I will do my best to pick a truly outstanding person just as soon as I can.Are you going to be able to comply with that request? President Mitterrand and I talked the other day, and he told me he was going to give some helicopters, which, as you know, he's done.And this morning was the first I have been informed of that.So we're going to discuss that today and make a decision.And I wouldn't say no, and a thousand questions no.Do I believe that there is a constitutional right to privacy? Yes, I do.Thank you.",clinton
"I want to say good afternoon to members of the press.We have just finished a very lively discussion about the massive task before us in health care.Vice President Gore and I made a strong commitment to the American people during the last election that we would present to the United States Congress, within 100 days, a plan that would take strong action to control health care costs in America and to begin to provide for the health care needs of all Americans.As I traveled across the country last year, no stories moved me more than the health care stories.As I think all of you know, many of the people in our Faces of Hope luncheon last week during the Inaugural were people who were struggling to overcome incredible adversity occasioned by their health care problems.We've met elderly people choosing every week between medicine and food; we've met people forced to leave their jobs to get on public assistance to deal with children with terrific problems; we've met countless people who can't change their jobs because they or someone in their family have had health care problems.You will all remember, at the economic conference that we sponsored in Little Rock, perhaps the overwhelming concern of the business people there, of all sizes, was doing something about the cost and the availability of health care.When the Vice President and I met with the big three auto makers and the president of the United Auto Workers, once again they said, if you want to do something to help rebuild the auto industry, do something to control health care costs.And as Mr.Panetta just said again in a rather plaintive way before you came in, there is no way we will ever get control of the Federal budget deficit unless we do something about health care.The message is pretty simple.It's time to make sense of America's health care system.It's time to bring costs under control and to make our families and businesses secure.It's time to make good on the American promise that too many people have talked about for too long, while we have continued to spend more than 30 percent more of our income on health care than any other nation in the world, get less for it, and see 100,000 Americans a month losing their health insurance.As a first step in responding to the demands of literally millions of Americans, today I am announcing the formation of the President's Task Force on National Health Reform.Although the issue is complex, the task force's mission is simple: Build on the work of the campaign and the transition, listen to all parties, and prepare health care reform legislation to be submitted to Congress within 100 days of our taking office.This task force will be chaired by the First Lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and will include the Secretaries of Health and Human Services, Treasury, Defense, Veterans Affairs, Commerce, Labor, as well as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and senior White House staff members.I am grateful that Hillary has agreed to chair this task force and not only because it means she'll be sharing some of the heat I expect to generate.As many of you know, while I was Governor of my State, Hillary chaired the Arkansas Education Standards Committee, which created public school accreditation standards that have since become a model for national reform.She served as my designee on the Southern Regional Task Force on Infant Mortality, was also chair of our State's rural health committee in 1979 and 1980, a time in which we initiated a number of health care reforms that benefit the people of my State to the present day.And on the board of the Arkansas Children's Hospital, she helped to establish our State's first neonatal unit.I think that in the coming months the American people will learn, as the people of our State did, that we have a First Lady of many talents, who most of all can bring people together around complex and difficult issues to hammer out consensus and get things done.Here in The White House, Hillary will work with my Domestic Policy Adviser, Carol Rasco; my Senior Policy Adviser, Ira Magaziner; and the head of our health care transition team, Judy Feder.I've asked all of them to be as inclusive as possible.And as a part of that, we are inviting the American public to write us here at the White House with their suggestions.All of them should be sent to the Task Force on National Health Care Reform at the White House in Washington, DC 20500.We will no doubt be criticized by some for undertaking something very, very ambitious.But as I said in my Inaugural Address, we're going to have to make some tough choices in order to control health care costs, to bring them down within inflation, and to provide health care for all.In order to preserve the vitality of the American private sector, in order to keep the American people's budget here at this national level from going totally bankrupt, we are going to have to make some tough choices.Powerful lobbies and special interests may seek to derail our efforts, and we may make some people angry.But we are determined to come up with the best possible solution.And in my lifetime, at least, there has never been so much consensus that something has to be done.We have a plan from the American Nurses Association, from the American Academy of Physicians, from the American Academy of Family Practice, from the health insurance industry itself.We have a plan uniting business and labor.There is an overwhelming knowledge that we have to move and move now.We are going to do our best to reform our system.We are going to do our best to meet the human needs of the people of this country.There are all kinds of problems that have to be dealt with that we haven't even discussed yet: access to care in inner cities and rural areas, coverage for little children, dealing with the AIDS crisis adequately, still unmet needs in the area of women's health care, the problem of the veterans in this country who don't have access to care, even as their own network goes broke.All these issues will be dealt with in this task force.This is going to be an unprecedented effort.And let me just say, in general, we're going to set up a workroom, kind of like the war room we had in the campaign, over in the Executive Office Building.And all of the departments you see here represented and leaders you see represented around this table will be represented in that room.And we are going to work constantly, day and night, until we have a health care plan ready to submit to the Congress that we believe we can pass.Finally, let me say I am committed to doing this in a partnership with the Congress.I will ask the leadership of the Congress to work with me on a bipartisan basis and to do whatever we can to make sure that as we present the plan, we have also maximized its chances of early passage in the Congress.I thank all these people for their willingness to serve and to work together.I hope the American people will see just how passionately I personally am committed to doing something about health care reform.We've talked about it long enough.The time has come to act, and I have chosen the course that I think is most likely to lead to action that will improve the lives of millions of Americans.President, can you provide universal coverage without driving up the deficit? I think you can do it if you control the cost of health care.You have to really&mdash;let me just&mdash;I don't want to get into one of these things that provoke a lot of cartoons about my policy work weakness, but we're at 14 percent of our income on health care now.The next most expensive health care system in the world is Canada's.It's at about 9.2 percent of income.That is a huge difference, massive.And yet, every other major country with which we compete provides some basic health care to everybody, something we don't do.So the answer to your question is, in my judgment, if we do this right over the next 8 years, you're going to see huge savings in tax dollars and even bigger savings, more than twice the savings, in private dollars that will free up hundreds of billions of dollars literally between now and the end of the decade to reinvest in economic growth and opportunity.In the short run, our tough call will be, how do you take the savings and phase in universal coverage, or should there be some other way to pay for that? We've got some short-term calls to make.But there's no question that in the medium term, 5 to 8 years, you're looking at massive savings with universal coverage, in both tax dollars and private sector dollars, if we do it right.President, do you intend to pay the First Lady for her efforts? No.No.I never have paid her for her public service efforts.I don't want to start now.I think we know what the major alternatives are.What we have to do now is something nobody's done, and that is to meld them into the best possible legislation, taking account of some of the problems that exist with every course.And let me make one acknowledgment on the front end about this.Legitimate objections can be raised to any course of action in this area.That is, there is no such thing as a perfect solution.So whatever course we choose to take, somebody can say, Well, it's not perfect for these reasons.To that, I have two answers, and I'm going to say this until I'm blue in the face for this entire year until we get action.Number one, the worst thing we can do is keep on doing what we're doing now, because more and more people are falling out of the system and the cost is becoming more and more burdensome to those who are still bearing it.So whatever course we take, we will preserve what is best about American health care, some consumer choice and the quality of care.So whatever problems we have, they won't be as bad as the ones we've got now.Number two, this is not going to be the end of the line.Whatever problems are there can be fixed later.But we will never, never get anywhere if we stand paralyzed, because there's no such thing as a perfect alternative.Clinton? Of all the people I've ever worked with in my life, she's better at organizing and leading people from a complex beginning to a certain end than anybody I've ever worked with in my life.And that's what I want done here.",clinton

That's great.Mrs.Hatton.Thank you so much, Mr.President.I'm proud of you.Mrs.Hatton.And I'm proud of you.Great things happen to great people.Thank you.President, are you building incentives to help the economy and working with Congress? Are you getting momentum having all these meetings with the Hill, with Chairman Greenspan? Well, I think so.You know, we've got a lot more meetings ahead.I'm going to have a huge number of meetings, I hope, next week with Members.I needed this first week just to kind of get our feet on the ground here and get organized and get ready.But I have held a lot of meetings with Congress, and I'll do many more next week.I'll do as many as I can leading up to the February 17 address to the joint session.And after that I'll do as many more as I can.President, are you confident that you'll ever get the ban on gays in the military lifted? Well, we're working on the resolution in the Senate, as you know.And I've been working mostly on economic issues today, so I just heard from my staff.You'll have to come back to me when there's final language there.I think the Joint Chiefs should have 6 months to deal with the practical issues involved.This is not free of difficulty.There are certain factual problems involved.The principle behind this for me is that Americans who are willing to conform to the requirements of conduct within the military services, in my judgment, should be able to serve in the military and that people should be disqualified from serving in the military based on something they do, not based on who they are.That is the elemental principle.There is actually an enormous amount of agreement on this.The Joint Chiefs agree, for example, that we should not anymore ask people about their sexual orientation when they enlist.And I believe that any sort of improper conduct should result in severance.The narrow issue on which there is disagreement is whether people should be able to say that they're homosexual&mdash;and do nothing else&mdash;without being severed.But there are a whole lot of very complicated practical questions that flow from that very narrow issue.And that's what I want to have 6 months to give them a chance to work on.So, I hope we can.",clinton
"Thank you very much, Al.And hello, ladies and gentlemen.I want to thank you for agreeing to join us on this telephone call today and through this telephone call to speak to the people in your own State and throughout the United States.One of the things that we are determined to do here in Washington is open the Government to you and never let people forget, who are here making decisions, that you and lives are at stake and that these matters that we discuss and vote upon here really do affect real people out in our country.So with that, let me just now go from one person to the next and let each of you say something about how this family and medical leave act might affect your life in the future or could have affected your life in the past or the fact that we didn't have it affected you.We believe that next week, the Congress and the leaders who have worked on this in both parties will help our Nation join the 72 other countries who already have family and medical leave.And if it happens, it will be because of people like you and for people like you.I think a lot of you said this, but I just want to close with this: It's easy for people to talk about family values, but it's also important for us to value families.And your Government is going to be given a chance to value the American family next week.We hope and pray they'll do it.And if it does happen, you all can claim a lot of the credit.Thank you so much for being with us today, and have a wonderful time.And keep those kids making that good noise.I like to hear it.Bless you all.Goodbye.",clinton
"Thank you very much, Senator Ford, Mr.Speaker, Majority Leader Gephardt, Senator Mitchell, Senator Dole, Representative Michel.I'd like to begin by saying I didn't get much sleep last night, and if I get through this it will be tour de force.Al Gore and I stayed up a long time talking last night about this day and this country and what we hoped that we could do.I want to say first how very grateful I am to the Congress for the exertions here to make this Inaugural Day such a meaningful and wonderful one.I would like to especially thank Senator Ford who worked so hard to make sure everything went off without a hitch.And he did.I also thank you for the wonderful gift of crystal, the letter opener, which I will treasure always, that proved that we did get enough electoral votes to be here today.And Mr.Speaker, I'm delighted to have that key.However, with all respect, I can't believe you were fully briefed about my proclivities in lobbying legislators to let me come up here without an invitation.I may be here all the time.Once in a generation we really are called upon to redefine the public interests and the common ground.I honestly do believe much of what we have to do today is work that knows no necessary partisan label and does not fall easily within the conventional divisions of liberal and conservative or Republican and Democrat.The second point I wish to make is that I cannot succeed as President unless Congress itself succeeds and the American people like the Congress again, too.For I seek to do, and to do we have to work together and move forward together.So I would like, in gratitude and respect, to propose a toast to a new partnership in America's Government.",clinton
"Thank you very much.Thank you, Congressman Stokes, Senator Metzenbaum.I want to thank Lou Stokes and Howard Metzenbaum for the support that they have given to this administration to making a new beginning for America, to putting the American people back to work, and to giving Washington back to you.I also want to say a special word of thanks to my friend Eric Fingerhut for coming here, the leader of the freshmen in Congress and a great Representative, someone who believes in the cause of reform.I want to thank your fine Mayor, Mike White, who labored mightily to try to get some more money for jobs here in Cleveland.I wish people all over America who think that our cities aren't working would come to Cleveland and see houses being built, the stadium going up, new malls being built, and things happening.I think it is very, very impressive what is happening here under the leadership of Mike White.And I appreciate him very much.I also want to thank Congressman Hoke for coming here.I'm glad to see a bipartisan Representative.I'm trying to govern in a bipartisan way, and some of those fellows in the Senate don't want me to.But if we get together on America's problems as America, we'd do a lot better than pointing partisan fingers.Finally, I want to thank attorney general Lee Fisher and your State treasurer, Mary Ellen Withrow.And I want to say a special word of thanks to Lee for his leadership in our campaign last year.I haven't been to Cleveland since the day before the election&mdash;that's right, that's what Lou said.I have been to Ohio once since I've been President.I look forward to coming back.I want to talk to you a little today about why I came to the middle of the country in the middle of the day to reiterate what is at stake in Washington.I just walked through the Galleria here.I want to thank the people who opened it up to me and Mr.Cleary and Mr.Masters.I want to thank all the store owners who came out to see me.Some of them gave me some things and some of them sold me some things, which is, after all, the most important thing.They did a good job.I wanted to come back here to remind you that the reason I did all that work last year and came here and asked the people of Ohio and Cleveland to vote for me was not so I could live in the White House but so I could give the Government back to you.The struggles in which we are engaged now are very important ones.It may seem strange to you, but there are really people in Washington who believe the most important thing we can do is to avoid change at all costs.It may seem strange to you after years of living with a Government where the debt of this country went from $1 trillion to $4 trillion between 1980 and 1992, where unemployment went up and wages went down and we began to lose our competitive position, where we cut defense but had no plan to put our defense workers to work building the domestic economy, with all the troubles we've got, where we've got 37 million Americans with no health insurance and others in small businesses terrified they're going to lose it and people who can't change jobs because they've had somebody in their family sick and they know they can't get health insurance in a new place, it may seem strange to you, but there really are people in the Nation's Capital who say no more change.Well, I think most of you want us to do something, and I think you want us to be bold.I think you want us to try to turn this country around, and I think you would rather see us err on the side of effort than on the side of just preserving the status quo.You look at these children here, these schoolchildren, or those fine schoolchildren back there or these young naval cadets.This whole deal is about whether they are going to have the American dream, about whether people who work hard and play by the rules are going to wind up better off or worse off.We've got a lot of complicated problems.I knew when I got there it wasn't going to happen overnight.I tried to make it happen overnight.I've been criticized for doing more than one thing at once.I've always felt&mdash;can you do one thing at once? Wouldn't it be nice if all you had to do was go to work and not take care of your family? Wouldn't it be nice if you could pay your bills and not earn any money to pay them? I don't understand this whole&mdash;you can't do one thing at once.But anyway, that's what they say.We are trying to do a lot of things, but they all relate to restoring the economic vitality of this country and restoring the middle class and the values of the middle class to a central part in American life.That is what this whole economic program is about and what I came to talk to you about again today.No one said it would be easy, but it has been immensely rewarding.In about 110 days, after two vetoes, I can look back and say we signed the Family and Medical Leave Act to guarantee you don't lose your job if you've got somebody sick in your family.We have put forward comprehensive plans to use technology to generate new jobs, comprehensive plans to help move people from defense jobs into domestic jobs and to make sure that our young people who come out of the service after serving this country are not just left out in the cold because of the cutbacks.And we got a record approval of the outline of a budget that cuts the deficit of this country over $500 billion in the next 5 years with over 200 specific budget cuts and, yes, with some tax increases.Seventy percent of them fall on the upper 5 percent of the American people whose taxes went down and whose incomes went up in the 1980's.I think it's a good plan, and it will restore health to the American economy.You know, we're trying to do something no generation of Americans has ever had to do.I came into office with a record debt.And then after the election I was told the deficit was really about $50 billion higher in 3 of the next 4 years than we'd been told before.And yet, we looked around, and we saw we'd reduced our investment in education and training, reduced our investment in new technologies, had no plan to deal with people who lose their jobs because of defense cutbacks.And so we had to do something nobody had ever done.We had to try to find out how to bring the debt down and invest in our people, their jobs, and their future.I think we have got to do that.If we don't do both, we're going to be in big trouble.Now look at the result.Since the election, since it became absolutely clear that this administration was dead serious about bringing this deficit down.Interest rates in many areas have hit an all-time low, home mortgages are at a 20-year low.I know there are people in this audience who have refinanced a home mortgage in the last 5 months.I know there are people here who have lower credit card rates, lower business loan rates, lower other rates because of interest rates going down.That's going to put $100 billion back into this economy to spur investment and growth and jobs and income if we bring the deficit down.Now, we're going to go into a fight where everybody's going to say cut more spending and raise fewer taxes.And you know, what that really says is cut somebody else's spending and raise somebody else's taxes.I wish it were possible for us all to hide behind a tree and point at somebody else.But let's face it, in the last 12 years we got into this mess not overnight and we're not going to get out of it overnight.We also, whether we like it or not, got into it together.We're all in it together, and we'd better get out of it together.We're going to have to climb out of it together, march out of it together, and walk out of it together.But this plan is fair.This plan has a big increase in the earned-income tax credit to try to relieve families with income of under $30,000 of the burden of the energy tax I proposed, which will raise money and help to clean up the environment.This plan has an increase in this earned-income tax credit so much that if you work 40 hours a week and you've got a child in the home, if you will apply for the tax credit, you will be lifted out of poverty.That is an elemental principle and a fundamental departure in America.We're going to reward work and not welfare for a change.If you work and you've got kids, we're going to lift you out of poverty.This will work.It will bring the deficit down.It will be fairer to working families.It will help us to keep interest rates down.It will help us to grow the economy.And over the next 5 years, we'll have some money to invest in education and training and new technologies and jobs and trying to help all those people in those high-tech jobs that are losing them, because of defense cutbacks&mdash;they can make us strong here at home if we do it fight.But we've got to do it as a package.If everybody goes around saying, What's in it for me? instead of what's in it for us, the thing will come apart.That's what paralyzes America.Every time we've got to make a tough decision, somebody says, Let somebody else do it.There's nobody else to do it but us.We're going to have to lift our country up, and we're going to have to do it together.One of the things that I do want to do is to repeal the tax breaks that lobbyists get.There are 80,000 lobbyists in Washington making sure that I can't take care of your interests.One of the things that we also have to do, I think, is to reform the political system.I told you if you would elect me President, I'd do my best to reduce the influence of lobbyists and special interest groups to increase your influence, to make it possible for all of the Members of Congress, without regard to party, at least to feel freer to follow their conscience and their constituents and to listen to them with an open ear and an open heart.Well, there are two bills moving through the Congress now that will do just that.When I took office the first thing I did was to sign an Executive order saying that people that had top jobs for me couldn't go back into lobbying for 5 years and could never lobby for a foreign government.Then a bill was introduced into the Congress that just passed the United States Senate which, for the first time, requires all the lobbyists to register and requires them to report all the gifts they give to Members of Congress over a small amount, so you'll know.And at the end of last week we announced a new campaign finance reform bill, which will do this: It will reduce the influence of big money; it will reduce the influence of political action committees; it will reduce the influence of lobbyists; it will give political campaigns back to you.It does it by limiting the amount of money that Members of Congress can take from political action committees by reducing the maximum contribution in many areas.It does it by saying that lobbyists cannot give money or raise money for Members of Congress that they personally lobby.And by repealing the tax exemption that lobbyists get, we're going to take that money and give it to Members of Congress as communication vouchers so we can open the airwaves to honest debate, and nobody is denied the opportunity to be on the television or the radio just because they're not an incumbent or just because they're not wired to the lobbyists.It is a good plan.It will give the Government back to you, the middle class of this country, and we ought to pass it.There are some other things that I think you need to know about that we're trying to do.We've introduced our plans for national service and to make college available to all Americans, and here's how it works.But I need your help to pass it, because there are interest groups that are against it.There are interest groups against everything.This plan would say to every American family: You can borrow the money to go to college without fear of going bankrupt because you will not have to pay it back until you go to work.And when you go to work, you can pay it back as a percentage of your income.So that no matter how much you borrow, you can't be required to pay more than a certain percentage of your income; you can't be bankrupted to secure your future.The bill also will give tens of thousands of young Americans the opportunity to pay their college loan, or a portion of it, off through service to our country as teachers, as police officers, working with kids in trouble.They can earn it before they go to college, while they're in college, or after they get out.But I think people ought to be able to work to make Cleveland and Ohio a better place and pay their college loans off.And believe it or not, if we just have the courage to change the way we're financing the college loan program, we can pay for most of this, particularly in the early years.Why? Because the way the college loan programs work now, we are losing billions of dollars a year in huge transaction fees to banks and in loan defaults, because the Government guarantees 90 percent of every one of these loans.So what happens? If somebody wants to default on the loan, what incentive does the bank have to go collect it? It would cost you 10 percent to pay the lawyer.So the taxpayers pay.I say let's make the loans direct.Let's cut out all the fat fees.Let's make people pay them back at tax time so they can't beat the bill, more responsibility and more opportunity for everybody.Let me just make two other points.First of all, while I have proposed over 200 specific budget cuts to take the lead in reducing this deficit by over $500 billion, I want you to know that nothing we can do will reduce this deficit over the long run to zero, which is what we want, until we finally face the fact that the biggest culprit in Government spending today is the exploding cost of health care.If we don't have the courage to try to provide a basic system of health coverage to all Americans, to try to give security to small businesses and working families who have health insurance but are terrified that they're going to lose it&mdash;if we don't do that, then you will never get this deficit down to zero because the cost of Government health care is going up by 12 percent a year.And 100,000 Americans a month are losing their health insurance.Now there is no easy answer to this.If it were easy, somebody else would have done it already.It's hard.Why? Because we're spending too much money on health care, but it's in all the wrong places.And the question is: How are you going to move the money from where it shouldn't be, in administrative costs and extra procedures and duplicated technologies and a lot of other things, to where it should be, covering people who don't have health insurance without bankrupting small business, without imposing undue Financial burdens, without imposing new taxes on people that are already paying too much.Can it be done? You bet it can, but it won't be easy, and it will require people who have been making a killing out of the present system to accept some change.But I'm telling you, the worst thing we can do is to do nothing.When we come out with this plan everybody will say&mdash;well, whatever we say to get the money to people who don't have health insurance now or to provide health security to those who can't change jobs now, they'll call that a tax.But when we lower by millions and millions and millions of dollars a year the health insurance premiums of people who are paying too much or the paperwork burdens of the doctors and hospitals who are spending too much money filling out paper, they don't want to count that-the defenders of the status quotas an offset.We are going to have to change, folks, but most of what we have to do is to move the money from where it shouldn't be to where it should.We're already spending plenty of money, but we've got to move it around.And you ought to be able to see that not only will it cost some people some more money to have health insurance, but a lot of people who are paying too much will save.And that is what we have to do.If we don't have the courage to change, we will not get the Government budget under control.But most important, working-class families in this country and small business people will never have the health security without which it is virtually impossible to have a good life over the long run.We have got to do this.And I am determined to see that we do.Let me just close by saying this: This is a difficult time.I told somebody the other day that I was absolutely convinced after 100 days as President that all the easy decisions had already been made by somebody else.Every day I meet with my staff and I say, send me just one easy one.Let's declare a moratorium.We won't talk about anything hard today.Send me an easy one.I'm still waiting.It is in our power.We can bring the deficit down.We can increase our investment in education and jobs.We can meet the competitive challenges ahead of us.We can face the health care challenge.But we have got to have the courage to change.And we will win if we do that.I wish to goodness I could just say to every one of you, you don't have to do any of this.I'll just go to some other State and make them do it.Everybody will always be able to find some fault with every comprehensive proposal like this.There's no such thing as a perfect proposal.I don't like everything about everything that we have presented in the hope of passing and securing change.But the test for this generation, the test for this whole generation is whether we are going to have the courage to make these changes, to rebuild the middle class, and to lift up the economy of this country and to lift up all these children in this audience today.I believe you have that courage, and together we're going to do it.Thank you, and God bless you all.",clinton
"Thirty-nine years ago the great grandson of a slave became the first African-American to serve on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.In 1961, amidst fierce opposition, President John F.Kennedy appointed Thurgood Marshall as only the second African-American to fill a vacancy on the U.S.Court of Appeals.In doing so, President Kennedy not only ensured that the people of the Second Circuit would be served by an excellent jurist; he also took a big step forward in America's ongoing efforts for equal opportunity in every aspect of our life, including our courts.Judge Marshall went on to become one of our Nation's most distinguished jurists, highlighted by his 1967 appointment by President Johnson as the first African-American Justice of the United States Supreme Court.President Kennedy's action was in the grand tradition of Presidents of both parties, dating all the way back to George Washington, who have used their constitutional authority to bring much-needed balance and excellence to our Nation's courts.Four of the first five African-Americans to ascend to the appellate bench were initially appointed in the same fashion that I employ today.To fill a similar gap in our judicial system, I am honored today to announce my appointment of Roger Gregory, one of Richmond's most respected trial lawyers, to fill an emergency vacancy on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.I will renominate him when Congress returns in January, and I urge the Senate to confirm him.I take this extraordinary step for extraordinary reasons.First, the people of the fourth circuit are not receiving the judicial representation they deserve.The U.S.Judicial Conference has declared this seat a judicial emergency.It has been vacant for more than a decade.In the last 5 years alone, fourth circuit caseloads have increased more than 15 percent; yet one-third of its judgeships are vacant.This has left too many citizens waiting in line for justice.It is a travesty in a nation that prides itself in the fair and expeditious rule of law.Second, it is unconscionable that the fourth circuit, with the largest African-American population of any circuit in our Nation, has never had an African-American appellate judge.As I said when I first nominated Roger Gregory, it is long past time to right that wrong.Justice may be blind, but we all know that diversity in the courts, as in all aspects of society, sharpens our vision and makes us a stronger nation.Time and again, for 5 years now, I have tried and tried to fill these gaps in justice and equality.And time and again, for 5 years now, the Senate majority has stood in the way.Third, and perhaps most important, Roger Gregory is the right man at the right time to fulfill this historic role.His life is a testament to the power and promise of the American dream.The son of factory workers, he's the first in his family to graduate from high school, let alone college and law school.He graduated summa cum laude from Virginia State University and went on to earn his law degree from the University of Michigan Law School.He returned to teach at Virginia State, where his mother had once worked as a dormitory maid.He is now one of Virginia's leading litigators and one of its most civic-minded citizens.He's earned high praise from all quarters, including the American Bar Association, religious leaders, and both of Virginia's Senators, Republican Senator John Warner and Democratic Senator Chuck Robb.I want especially to thank Senator Robb for all he has done to make this day possible, for his tireless leadership in the Senate on this and so many other issues.He worked very hard to get back here today, but the bad weather down in Texas made it impossible.But I do want to thank him.He convinced me, and when I looked into the record I saw that it was absolutely true, that Roger Gregory would make an excellent judge for all the people of the fourth circuit.In closing, let me say I have not come to this decision lightly.I have always respected the Senate's role in the appointment process.Indeed, I have made far fewer recess appointments than President Reagan did in his 8 years, and I believe that the record on that is perfectly clear.On the other hand, I am compelled by the facts and history to do what I can to remedy an injustice that for too long has plagued the fourth circuit, and that I have tried for too long to remedy in the established way.As President, it is my constitutional responsibility to see that justice for all is not just what we promise; it's what we practice.That is the principle behind my appointment of this distinguished American today.Mr. Gregory, congratulations.I'll answer your questions;I can't resist injecting just a little bit of levity here.One of the things you want in a judge is someone who is well-organized and has a good sense of timing.His children are 18, 12, and 6.Based on the months and months of discussion I've had on these final status issues, we have attempted to narrow the range of outstanding matters in a way that meets the essential needs of both sides.The whole question now is whether they agree to continue the negotiation on the basis of these ideas.We've got to bring this to a conclusion if we're going to continue.The issues are extremely difficult, but they are closer than they have ever been before.And I hope and pray they will seize this opportunity.And I think that is all I should say at this time.The less I say, the better.The Palestinian officials have been saying they cannot accept your proposals.Prime Minister Barak has said that he would accept and continue the negotiations if the Palestinians would, and we'll see what happens.There's a lot of things going on now, and will be in the next several days, and I think, as I said, the less I say about them all, the better.And I hope that they will remember that this holiday season&mdash;interestingly enough in this season is not only the Christian season of Christmas, but the great Jewish and Muslim holy days happen to coincide in the same week this year.So I hope that we will remember, amidst our celebration, to pray for all the people involved.President, do you think the issue of minority judgeships should be brought up in the Ashcroft confirmation hearings? And was this appointment in part aimed at highlighting that issue, and could, in fact, those hearings increase Mr.This is unrelated.I have tried for 5 years to put an African-American on the fourth circuit&mdash;for 5 years.Now&mdash; and for all the reasons that I made in my&mdash; stated in my remarks, I think it is most unfortunate that it has not been done, and I just determined to do it.It's just time to do it.On the other question, that is something that the Senate will have to deal with.I'll be&mdash;it's not my appointment, and I won't be President, and I don't think I should say any more about it.The Senate will do what it thinks is proper there.You know I just have a limited number of days here before I leave office, and I'm trying to get as much done as I can, including on that.I may have some more to say in the next few days about it.President, the reimportation-of-drugs law that you signed and which today you received the letter from Secretary Shalala&mdash;some folks are wondering why you would sign a law that contained such supposed flaws as were identified by the Secretary.She is required by law to make a determination that&mdash;two things&mdash;one, that the reimportation would not weaken the safety standards that we have for Americans and their pharmaceuticals.I think she could do that.But the second was, she had to make a determination by law that this would lower prices for American consumers.And the law was so different from the one we proposed and is so full of loopholes that she could not say in good conscience that she believed that the prices for consumers would go down, which is exactly what I warned when I asked them not to do this.So what we'd like to see is a law that protects safety, that will lower consumer prices.I do think that people ought to be able to do this, and&mdash;I did before, but I will again, as soon as the Congress comes back&mdash;I'll send them a statement of the things that I believe would meet the standard of the law.I think that Secretary Shalala did what she thought the law required her to do, and since she couldn't certify that American consumers wouldn't get lower prices, she didn't want to hold out false hope and be involved in something she thought was not legitimate.So I hope we can work this out.I do think there was in the last Congress, and I think there will be in this one, a majority for allowing Americans to reimport drugs under strict safety standards at lower prices.But I think we have to do it in a way where we don't promise something that doesn't materialize.That's all, really, that was at issue here.And I think&mdash;we'll send something up in the way of clarifying language as soon as they come back next week and see what we can do.President, the Bush team has said that they're going through all of your Executive orders and your administration's regulations with a fine-tooth comb, and they may undo them.And when they take office, you have to expect them to do what they think is right.And you have to expect the people who disagree to disagree.And democracy will work its will, and then the citizens of the country will make their judgments.All I can do is to do what I think is right.And these things that we've been doing lately are things that we've been working on for years.For example, the&mdash;let me just use one example&mdash;the medical privacy regulations, which I think are profoundly important, we tried to do that through legislation, and the Congress&mdash;to be fair to the Congress&mdash;adopted a bill which said, okay, we've got to get this work done by a certain date, but if we can't get it done, then the administration can take action.So when it became obvious that because of all the conflicting interest groups that it wouldn't be possible for them to do that, when the date elapsed, passed, we decided that we would take action, as the Congress had explicitly authorized us to do.In terms of Secretary Browner's order regarding the trucks and the fuel, diesel fuel&mdash;which I think is a very, very important part of our clean air efforts, when asthma is the number one health problem among children in our country today&mdash;we've been working on that for years.That's not some sort of eleventh-hour thing.It's just that we didn't&mdash;this is when we finished, and so we did it.And I think we should just do what we think is right, and then when they get in, they'll do what they think is right.That's what democracy is all about.And they'll either&mdash;if they want to undo these things, then they'll either be able to do it or they won't, as the process plays itself out.That's the way the system works.And I have no problem with that.They have to do what they think is right, just like we do.I just expect to do some.I have done&mdash;I haven't seen the final numbers, but before the last batch at least, I had done fewer than any President in almost 30 years.And part of that, frankly, is the way the system works, something I'm not entirely satisfied with.But I think that it is appropriate for the President to do them where circumstances are appropriate.I have always thought that Presidents and Governors, when I was a Governor, should be quite conservative on commutations&mdash;that is, there needs to be a very specific reason if you reduce someone's sentence or let them out&mdash; but more broadminded about pardons because, in so many States in America, pardons are necessary to restore people's rights of citizenship.Particularly if they committed relatively minor offenses, or if some years have elapsed and they've been good citizens and there's no reason to believe they won't be good citizens in the future, I think we ought to give them a chance, having paid the price, to be restored to full citizenship.And in that sense, I think that the word is almost misused, because it's not like you&mdash;you can't erase the fact that someone has been convicted and served his sentence, in the case of those who have.But there are many people, including more people than I get their applications to my desk&mdash;many people don't have lawyers; they don't even know to ask for a pardon&mdash; but they'd like to vote at election time; they'd like to be full citizens.And they're out there working hard and paying taxes, and they have paid the price.So I would like to be in a position to do that.A lot of the folks&mdash;virtually all of them on the first list I released, 58, I think, were people that are unknown to most Americans.They're not people with money or power or influence.And I wish I could do some more of them&mdash;I'm going to try.I'm trying to get it out of the system that exists, that existed before I got here, and I'm doing the best I can.We're looking for a venue, and after the first of the year, I'll probably do at least one more.Thank you all very much.Thank you.",clinton
"Thank you very much.Well, I don't know what you had for lunch, but I wish I'd had some of it.And I hold here in my hand a membership to the City Club given to me by Senator Metzenbaum.Now, I'd rather have his vote on all the issues, but I'll take this.I'm delighted to be here with all of you.I saw in the introduction that you mentioned something I was going to say in my own remarks.I very much enjoyed being here last year and having the opportunity to talk in Cleveland about family values.Two years ago, I came here; the Mayor hosted the Democratic Leadership Council's national convention.And I said at that time that I thought the time had come for us to move beyond the political debate in Washington between one party which seemed to have advocated the politics of abandonment and another which seemed to advocate a politics of entitlement.It seemed to me that time had come for us to face our problems squarely as a country and to try to do something about them, but not to pretend that the Government could give a solution to the American people, solutions to problems that require all of us to give something ourselves and to do more.I feel that even more strongly today.For 110 days, I have lived and worked in Washington, DC.I think that all of us would agree that for too long our great Nation's Capital, which is filled with monuments to men and women who have done so much to bring us to this point in history, has practiced more politics than progress.I'm glad to be back here in a place like Cleveland where it's not possible to produce more politics than progress.Here you have to produce steel or automobiles or biomedical technology, real things with real value.This debate in which we are all engaged about America's future should properly take place here in the Industrial Belt and in the Grain Belt and in the Sun Belt and in the Bible Belt, all across America where people live in a word that is determined by consequences and not by talk.If you're a Mayor in a city like Cleveland, you either provided more houses and people moved into them, or it didn't happen.There either are more economic opportunities, or there aren't.You can measure that.In Washington, we're told that the most important thing to do is not more than one thing at a time.But I would argue to you, my fellow Americans, that the challenges of the moment require both a focus and a discipline on the big problems of our Nation and a determination to face them in a comprehensive way.The challenge of international competition, new technologies, soaring health care costs, defense cuts without an offsetting strategy to invest in America, a global recession, a global inability of wealthy countries to create new jobs in an open and competitive environment, all these things create great new challenges for our country.Here in the heartland, I've seen you stepping up to the challenges.When the Mayor and I rode in from the airport today, he talked to me about how people were moving from the suburbs back into the cities, how more houses were being built.I looked at some of your economic development projects.I see a partnership between the public and private sector here that does not require someone to check his political label in when you roll up your sleeves and go to work.That is the sort of thing we need to do in Washington and the kind of spirit I hope to be able to bring to our Nation's Capital.I believe very strongly that in the last 12 years, our Nation's Government has collectively produced two immense problems.Problem number one, obviously, is the enormous explosion of the national debt and the continuing growth of the annual Federal deficit.In 1980, our debt was $1 trillion.Today, it's $4 trillion and rising to about two-thirds of our annual national product, a much bigger percent of our annual deficit than, for example, the debt in Japan is.Now, how did it happen? It happened partly because we liked it when politicians told us what we wanted to hear.It happened because we had big tax cuts and big spending increases at the same time.First the spending increases were in defense.And then when defense began to be cut, they were totally offset, those cuts, by even bigger increases in health care spending through Medicare and Medicaid, the fact that one-tenth of America is now on food stamps, and by huge increases in interest payments on the national debt.The deficit is also aggravated by the fact that we index both payments to people and income taxes.Now, it's fair to index income taxes.If you get pushed by inflation into a higher bracket, we adjust the brackets upward.For the first time, that's happened in the last few years.No one can doubt that is fair.But consider the impact on that if you offset on the one&mdash;hello, Congressman Brown, I didn't see you out there&mdash;you offset, on the one hand, your income, and at the same time you promise to pay more out.So everybody that gets a salary or a retirement check, their payments go up with inflation even as your intake comes down with inflation.So these are the two things that have created the kind of problem we have in the budget deficit.The second thing that happened, interestingly enough, is that that portion of our Government budget which is in partnership with the private sector, making investments in our future and promoting economic growth, actually shrank as a percentage of the whole and often in absolute terms.So that at a time when we are more dependent than ever before on how skilled our work force is, the Federal commitment to education and training of the work force went down, as other nations were exploding their commitment.At a time when we were cutting high technology in the defense sector, the peace dividend was not automatically reinvested in new technologies in the commercial sector and new partnerships.Why? Because, as any Member of Congress here will tell you, the easiest place to cut spending is in that broad category known as discretionary nondefense spending.That doesn't mean anything.That's a lot of gobbledygook.But when you strip it away, a lot of it is our investment in our future.So we wind up with this unusual difficulty: a huge debt, an increasing deficit, and a diminished commitment to invest in our future.The results have been clear: a limited ability to create new jobs, even when productivity is growing.We're allegedly in an economic recovery of some 17 months in duration, and yet the unemployment rate is higher this month than it was at the depths of the recession.We had a huge increase in productivity in the last 3 months of last year and in the first 3 months of this year, another big increase in output for a person in the manufacturing sector.But that money now is being plowed back into new technologies or kept for profit, not to increase new jobs.As any small business person here knows, it is difficult to increase employment in a small business because of the extra added costs.By the time you pay the Social Security and the worker's comp and all the other costs, you've got more and more small businesses using overtime workers or part-time workers and fewer new jobs being created there.So here we are.What are we to do? I have asked the United States Congress to adopt a plan that I believe over the next 5 years will do something to make real, measurable change in both those areas.It will substantially reduce the Federal deficit in the most disciplined deficit reduction plan ever presented to Congress, and it will permit some very disciplined, targeted increases in those investments which are critical to our future.We do it by a combination of things: cutting spending, raising taxes, and targeting investment.Because this involves a whole lot of change, as you might imagine, it challenges a lot of established interests in Washington who would prefer that things go on as they are.Because while as a whole our country is disadvantaged, I would argue, by what we're doing, certain specific groups benefit from everything that is done.Now, the lobbyists are lining the corridors of Washington as never before.There are about 80,000 of them there.And unless all the American people speak out loud and clear, it's going to be hard for us to hold this program together.There are those fighting for the national interests and those who are properly there to be heard about more narrow interests.There are those who believe we can make things better and those who believe that any change will make things worse for them.There are those who believe we can spend money more productively and less wastefully and others who believe that we ought to just keep on spending it the way we are now, This is the oldest conflict in our history and the eternal battle of any great democracy.The impetus for inertia is always strong, and very often a country does not have the courage to change until it is almost too late.But I believe with all my heart that the voters said last November-not just those who voted for me, either but all the voters said, we know this country has got to take a different course.We know we can't keep drifting.We know we can't wander.We have to have a plan; we have to follow it.We have to try to make some things happen that will lift this country's spirits again, lift this country's prospects again, and yes, that will insist that all of us have the discipline and will and vision to change.Now, I think that there are a lot of, I would call them preachers of pessimism in our Nation's Capital who underestimate the capacity of the American people to know the cost of what is happening to us right now.I readily admit that none of these changes can occur unless a vast majority of us understand the cost of what is happening to us right now: the cost of maintaining this deficit at its present level; the cost of maintaining the present health care system; the cost of maintaining a system which is underinvesting in our future compared to all of our major competitors in a high-wage, highgrowth economy; the cost of maintaining the credit crunch on small business; the cost of having no technology policy; the cost of having no plan to convert from a defense to a domestic economy.I would argue that those costs are very high.The cost of having no strategy to put young people to work in our cities, and instead spending money to pay for the cleanup and the consequences of drag problems, gang problems, gun problems&mdash;the costs of the status quo are very, very high, even when you don't see it directly attributed on the Government's ledger books.I believe we don't see that enough.So I think we can do more than one thing at once.I think we can reduce the deficit and provide the opportunity for all of our young people to go to college.I think we can reduce the deficit and provide decent job training and education for our working people when the average worker will change jobs eight times in a lifetime.I believe we can reduce the deficit and put more police on our streets to protect our communities better.I believe we can reduce the deficit and offer more targeted incentives for real investment to American businesses and to their workers.I believe we can reduce the deficit and change the welfare system so that we move people from welfare to work after a certain amount of time.I believe we can do these things.I believe we're strong enough to provide for a budget that reduces the deficit and invests in the future in a prudent way.And I can't help noting that some of those who say that we can't do that are the very ones that brought the debt from $1 trillion to $4 trillion over the last 12 years.Our greatest Republican President, perhaps our greatest President, Abraham Lincoln, used to tell the story about when he was practicing law in Illinois.It kind of reminds me about some of these folks today talking about the deficit in Washington.He said it reminded him of a man who killed his parents and then threw himself on the mercy of the court because he was an orphan.We have to accept where we are.I don't care about who should bear the blame, but I don't think we should have people pointing fingers who helped to create the current course of events.We should pull together.My whole approach has been to try to say to the American people, we are all in this together.If we ask, what's in this program for me, instead of what's in it for us, we'll all find something we don't like, including me.If the issue is going to be now, what's in it for me, instead of what's in it for us, we are defeated before we begin.But the what's-in-it-for-me decade didn't work out very well for us over the long run, and I think we can do better.Now, shortly after I took office I submitted to Congress a blueprint of a budget that makes now over 200 specific budget cuts, reduces the deficit by over $500 billion over 5 years, and refocuses the priorities of our Government from consumption to investment in our future.Both Houses of the Congress passed that blueprint in record time; the first time in 17 years the budget resolution had passed within the calendar required.Our commitment to cut the deficit clearly boosted confidence on Wall Street, and it's beginning to be felt on Main Street.It is beginning to change lives for the better already.Starting after the November election, when we announced a clear determination to bring the deficit down, interest rates have been going down.The trend line is steady, with only minor interruptions whenever there's some sense that maybe we won't really reduce this deficit after all.The plan that I announced and the outline that Congress adopted clearly played a major role in bringing interest rates down to historic lows, mortgage rates to 20-year lows.There's been a huge wave of refinancing.I'll bet you anything there are lots of people in this room that since November have refinanced their home mortgages.I know that there are people in every city in America who have gotten business loans, whose consumer loans have gone down, whose costs of car financing have gone down.It is estimated that in the aggregate, if we can keep these rates down just a few more months, this will lead to enough refinancing of debt that it will release another $100 billion to be reinvested into this economy.That's one and two-thirds percent of our total gross domestic product in a given year.That is a huge impetus to stay on the track we're on to bring this deficit down.According to a bipartisan survey, a poll recently conducted in these conditions, 74 percent of all Americans now believe that homeownership is within reach for most young people.Do you know that it was a year ago? The reverse, 47 percent.The reason for the change is obvious: lower interest rates.Businesses are paying less to borrow.That means new investments and new jobs.The taxpayers, by the way, are saving billions of dollars in financing the Government debt.We've already brought the deficit down this year because of those interest rates.Along with that, we have launched a real effort to attack the credit crunch in partnership with community banks all across America, and that should mean that farmers, small business people, and homeowners will be able to do even more in the weeks and months ahead.These are things that happen when a people take some responsibility for their financial future.Having passed the budgetary blueprint, the Congress is now about to move into the specifics in what is called the budget reconciliation process.That means they've got to take the targets that were adopted in the budget resolution and specify how we're going to meet those targets: What kind of taxes are going to be raised? What kind of spending is going to be cut? What kinds of investments are going to be made? That is the process now beginning.And that is the kind of thing that will require us all to make tough choices to make good on the results that are being achieved.I've asked Congress to join me in making real spending cuts, and that process is now unfolding.Our budget contains, as I said, over 200 specific cuts.I thought I should start as President by setting an example.In the new fiscal year we'll be operating the White House with a staff that is 25 percent smaller than my predecessor's.I must say, I made that commitment, and we're going to do all that work.I have to say, in parenthesis, I didn't know that I'd receive more letters in the first 100 days than came into the White House in all of 1992.So if you haven't gotten your letter answered, hold on, I'm coming.We are going to reduce just in our office alone $10 million in payroll and perks and costs of Government.In the executive branch, I have ordered over the next 4 years a 14 percent cumulative reduction in the administrative costs of the Federal Government, 100,000 person reduction in the Federal payroll by attrition.That will save well over $9 billion.I have asked the Federal employees to have a pay freeze in this coming year and reduced raises in all the rest of this first term.I just left the Galleria, and right across the street there's a big Federal office building, and a lot of those Federal employees said they weren't looking forward particularly to doing without a raise next year.We have put the clamps on Federal spending, and we have asked Federal employees to make a sacrifice.I didn't see how I could ask people to raise their taxes unless the people who were getting the tax money also made a sacrifice.I come from a rural State where the Rural Electrification Agency, the REA, has been very important to my family and our people.They have brought life and hope to millions of Americans.But now our country is about 100 percent electrified, and I have recommended that we reduce the interest subsidies to the REA, something that is tough to do for Members of Congress from rural areas and for this President who came from that place.I may get shocked instead of light when I go home.It's only been in the Tax Code since 1962.Before that, it didn't exist.You had to pay if you wanted to go lobby.Now the taxpayers actually, at large, bear the burden of people's lobbying costs.Now, again, I'm all for people lobbying, and frankly, it's a good thing if it's in balance.But I don't see why the taxpayers should subsidize someone's costs when they go and try to influence the outcome of legislation in Washington.I've asked to cut urban programs that don't work.While I plead guilty to trying to get more community block grant funds for Mayor White so he could build more houses in Cleveland, I also called for the abolition of a designated project program at the Housing and Urban Development Department because it had no real accountability to the taxpayers and cost over $100 million a year.I also believe that after all these cuts are in place, if you really expect this deficit to be brought down, we have got to raise some more tax money.And I believe that we ought to do it in a progressive way.I can tell you this just to start out, I have proposed more budget cuts and more taxes than I thought I would when I was running, and the reason is simple: After the election the Government said the deficit was going to be $50 billion a year bigger in 3 of the next 4 years than we thought, and $15 billion in the 4th year.The deficit was announced after the election in each year to be much, much bigger than had previously been forecast.So we asked for about 73 percent of the money to be paid for by people with incomes above $100,000; the rest to be paid for, 27 percent, by the 93 percent or so of us that are under $100,000.And then there is an exemption in effect for the energy tax burden for lower middle income working people and middle income working people with children up to the levels of about $29,000 by the increase in the earned-income tax credit, which will offset the impact of the energy tax.I think it is a very fair program, and I hope it will be adopted.We take on the entitlements in this plan.People say, why don't you take on the entitlements? I'll tell you why, because people get mad at you when you do that.We asked Social Security recipients who are in the top 20 percent of income to pay taxes on more of their income than they do today, coming from Social Security.We have done our best to restrain the exploding costs of Medicare.We have taken on these tough issues to cut spending and to raise some money.But I would also argue to you that we must have some disciplined increases in investment.And I'll tell you where my recommendations are.I recommend, first of all, that we focus on rewarding work, strengthening families, and creating more jobs, especially for the middle class.These ideas include the following&mdash;this is where we spend money: First of all, in tax cuts to encourage investments for new jobs.Private enterprise is, after all, the engine of this economy, not the Government, and we need to get it running as close as we can to full throttle.So there are substantial new incentives in this program for both large business and small business to lower their taxes through direct investments.Investments mean lower taxes and more jobs and, therefore, more revenue to the Government by putting people to work if you target it to investment.I think it's very important.Secondly, we focus especially on the depressed areas of the country, both rural and urban, with establishing a new network of community development banks to make loans to people who want to go into business in these areas with special incentives to get others to do the same thing.With special kinds of enterprise zones, especially in the urban and rural areas which are particularly depressed, that will at least give us a chance to see if free enterprise alone can revive these areas if the Government gives them enough incentives.These are things I believe that will make the private sector work for all Americans.The plan also strengthens our schools by providing access to Head Start to all children who need it, by setting higher standards throughout the country and enshrining in the law the national education goals and the standards that they will produce.The plan encourages experimentation with things like public school choice and charter schools in public school.It contains a bold national apprenticeship program where the Federal Government is a partner with the private sector and State and local government in helping to retrain the work force for a lifetime.We are the only advanced country, the only one, that doesn't worry about having a systematic way of training high school graduates who don't go on to college.And yet we now have clear evidence, in the 1990 census, that anybody who graduates from high school but gets no further training or who drops out of high school who goes into the work force is likely to have declining earnings.This is good money, and it will be really shaped by private sector people and public trainers at the local grass roots level, not a national program but a national partnership.And it will really, really increase the productivity of the American work force.This plan also will open the doors of college education to all Americans by changing the nature of the student loan program.And I want to explain this.Today, the way the student loan program works, you can go down to your bank, you borrow the money, you pay it back based on how much you borrow.If you don't pay it back, the Government gives the bank 90 percent of the loan.That's the way it works.The college dropout rate is more than twice the high school dropout rate, in part because of the cost of a college education.The student loan program is very profitable for many banks and for the national mortgage organization that's behind it.They have made a killing out of it.It's terrible for the taxpayers.Why? Because if somebody defaults on the loan, there's no incentive to go get it because there's a 90 percent Government guarantee.And no offense to all of us lawyers in the crowd, but it's going to cost you more than 10 percent of the loan to pay a lawyer to go get it.Not only that, the repayment terms are often too burdensome.Here's what we want to do: Set up a system to make the loans directly.Let people pay back the loans only when they go to work, and then as a percentage of their income.So no one will ever not be able to repay, and no one will be discouraged from taking a lower paying but perhaps more rewarding job as a teacher or a police officer or whatever, but collect the money at tax time so you cannot beat the bill.Don't let people welch on their student loan anymore.And we estimate this system can save you $4.3 billion in the next 5 years.That's a lot of money.Let me tell you what we'd like to do with that money, or some of it, anyway.We'd like to give tens of thousands of our young people the opportunity to earn credit against college or pay off their college loan by doing community service before, during, or after they go to college: working with housing projects, working with environmental projects, working to help keep streets safer, working after they graduate as teachers or police officers in underserved areas.We can have a program of national service that is community based that will help us solve so many of our problems.I got a letter from a friend of mine, with whom I was in grade school, the other day, reminiscing about all kinds of things.And she had a very wise thing in this letter.She said, You know, somebody came up to me the other day and said, 'How are we going to save all these kids that are in trouble? How are we going to get them back?'.And she said, Without even thinking I said, 'We're going to get them back just the way we lost them, one at a time'.Now, you think about that.That's what this national service proposal could do.It could give all kinds of young people a chance to do something meaningful to help earn credit to go to college and to help solve the problems of Cleveland and Cincinnati and Columbus and Dayton and every other community in this country.That's the kind of thing that I think is money well spent.And we can pay for it if we just have the discipline to make the student loan program make sense again.I think we have to do it.Let me say, there are many other issues I could talk about, but I want to mention one other.I have spent a lot of the last 6 years working on the issue of welfare.I have probably spent more time than any elected politician talking to people who live on welfare checks.And I can tell you that nobody likes the system, least of all most people who live on it.But if you want to move people from welfare to work, you have to realize three or four basic things.First of all, you've got to make work pay; welfare can never be a better deal.Secondly, we've got to realize that it's not the welfare check that keeps people on welfare as much as it is the child care and the medical coverage for the children.Most people on welfare have kids.The third thing you've got to realize is that most people, not all but most people on welfare are woefully undereducated and can't claim a very good paycheck in the market that we're in, not all but a lot.So what is the answer? The answer is a comprehensive plan that will empower people to go to work, require them to take jobs when they can, and set a date certain beyond which no check comes without an effort being made either in a public or a private job.That's what I think should be done.We should do away with the system as we know it forever.It is a shackle on the spirit of millions of Americans, and we can change it.Now, here's what we're going to propose.One, in this plan, increase the earned-income tax credit.You can fill out a form on your taxes and get money back if you're eligible for the earned-income tax credit.And let's fix it so that any American who works 40 hours a week and has a child in the house is not in poverty.That is a simple, elemental principle that will reduce the incentive of welfare.Second, strengthen the system of child support enforcement.Don't lose $20 billion a year for people who beat their bills and won't support their kids.Let it cross the State lines.Third, provide a system of education and training so that people are empowered to do what can be done in this economy.Fourth, deal with the health care issue through the national health initiative that I'll say more about in a minute.And then finally, set up a system, it will take us a while to do it and to work out the financing, but set up a system so that after a certain amount of time, if there is no private sector job, to keep drawing a check you must make an effort.I think that will be a very good thing.And most people on welfare, once you take care of these other issues, will applaud the American people for changing that system.Nobody likes the system we've got.We've got to have the courage to change it, and I think we will this year.Finally, let me say a word about the last issue, which incorporates so much of the other.If you want to bring the deficit down to zero, which is what our goal ought to be, over a period of years, we must face the biggest exploder of the deficit and perhaps the biggest human dilemma America faces, and that's the health care crisis.This year we're going to spend 15 percent of our income on health care.The next nearest country will not spend 10 percent.Now, we should be spending more than everybody else for a number of reasons: Number one, we do more on medical research than any other country.Number two, we rely more on new technologies, and we enjoy that when we need it, as opposed to somebody else needing it.Number three, we have a more diverse population with more poor people than most other advanced countries, more cases of AIDS than most other advanced countries, and we are a more violent country than any other advanced country.So we pay more money, keeping emergency rooms open on the weekend for people getting shot and cut up.Anybody comes and paints some miracle picture on health care without telling you the truth is not credible.We cannot get our costs down to the level of other nations unless we make changes dealing with these big structural things.We can do something about this violence if we wanted to, and I'll have more to say about that as we go through this term.I've already tried to do too much at once, according to the experts.But let me tell you, we cannot continue to have health care costs go up at the rate of inflation anymore.We cannot do that here.This deficit, no matter how much we bring it down in the next 5 years, will start to go right up again because health care costs are going up at a projected 12 percent a year for the Government.A hundred thousand Americans a month are now losing their health insurance, coming right onto the Government rolls: people giving up jobs because they have sick children; people giving up health insurance to keep the small business from going broke; people giving up health insurance because they have to change jobs, and they have somebody in their family sick.And there are things that can be done about this.We are spending about 15 percent of every dollar in health insurance on administrative costs and insurance profit.That is exorbitant.It's about a dime a dollar more than any other country in the world is spending.The average doctor in 1980 was taking home 75 percent of all of the money that came into the clinic that he or she brought in, 75 percent.Do you know what it is now? Fifty-two percent; lost 23 cents on the dollar.Why? Because of paperwork.The blizzard of insurance requirements, the blizzard of Government requirements, and a few other things as well.We can do something about this.Now, the trick is going to be not to spend a lot more money but to move the money from where it shouldn't be to where it should.And some people will have to pay some more.But we are going to do the very best we can to make sure that the people who are entitled to a reduction in their insurance bills start to get it right away, and that we phase in the burdens of this so that no small business is bankrupt, so that the providers are relieved of a lot of these paperwork burdens, and so that we can actually both lower the costs to the millions and millions of Americans who are entitled to it and stabilize the rate of increase for everybody else.Now, the nay-sayers can always call any new responsibility that anybody assumes, that they are not assuming now, a tax.Five will get you ten, they'll never want to give any credit for all the cost reductions that will go to the tens of millions of Americans who are paying too much now.We have got to do something about this.We are the only advanced country in the world that has no system for covering everybody, maintaining health security for working families, and trying to keep costs somewhere near inflation.We can do that and preserve everything that is best about the American system, keep spending more than everybody else is, but not run this country into a ditch.And we've got to do it.In order to do it, all of us will have to take a view about the national interests that will not enable us to say, what's in it for me? We'll have to say, what's in it for us? There are a couple of things moving through the Congress that are very hopeful in that regard.One is the Senate passed a bill this week, that I strongly support, that requires all the lobbyists in Washington to register for a change.Did you know they didn't have to register before? A whole bunch of them never even registered.And limit very strictly the gifts that any Member of Congress can receive without reporting them.They're going to have to report the money that all the lobbyists make, and the lawyers.And now, we introduced last Friday a new campaign finance reform bill that will limit the cost of congressional campaigns, limit the influence of political action committees, and open the airwaves to challengers and incumbents alike so that the people get a real race every time, and pays for it by repealing the deduction for lobbyist expenses.I hope that those two things can pass.To get economic reform, you're going to have to have political reform.I'm sure of that.Bring down the deficit; do it with spending cuts and tax increases.No tax increases without the spending cuts.Invest in education and training, new technologies, incentives to business, changing the welfare system.And have political reform; face health care.That is a big agenda, but that is America's agenda.If we're going to bring this country back, that is what we must do.I hope you and every American, without regard to political party, in good faith, will ask the United States Congress to engage these issues this year so that we can move this country in the future.Thank you very much, and God bless you.",clinton
"Thank you very much, Brian.Thank you, Dr.Meredith.And thank you, ladies and gentlemen.I'm glad to be here at this fine high school.I should also note before I begin that one of many reasons that I decided to come here is that this high school is the alma mater of an important member of my White House staff, Kevin O'Keefe, who graduated from Fenton High School.Where are you? Where's Kevin? Stand up.He didn't have that gray hair when he was here.I met, in addition to your principal and your superintendent, I met Charlotte Sonnenfeld on the way in here, who said she was a teacher of Kevin O'Keefe but was not responsible for him in any way.I think they're all here.And I want to thank Richard Dent of the Chicago Bears for coming.Stand up, Richard.I also want to&mdash;is Michael Cruz over there? Is he here? No? Where is he? Here he is.Come here.This young man was on the President's town hall meeting with students.Did any of you see it? Did you see that? And he became a television star because he is a good student.He goes to school in Chicago, and he said he was worried about the safety of the schools and the streets.And he asked the President to try to make all the schools safe for students in every part of America, no matter how tough the neighborhoods were.And I was really proud of him, so I invited him to come here today.I think you ought to give him a hand.Where are you, all the students from the other schools that are here?Audience members.Boo-o-o! Hey, hey.I want to say how very glad I am to be back in Illinois where I met so many people who shaped the thoughts and the feelings that I carried into the Presidential campaign last year.People who asked me to fight for their families and the future of their children, to help to fix our economy, to create more jobs, to bring the terrible budget deficit down, to deal with the health care and education challenges facing America.A lot of what I learned in that campaign last year I learned from talking to people on the streets in the cities and towns of Illinois, and I'm glad to be back.This week, some of the Members of Congress whom I hoped would be here are in Washington working on things of importance to you.Your two United States Senators, Paul Simon and Carol Moseley-Braun, are in the Senate today because they're going to vote on the motor voter bill, which will make it easier for young people to register and vote, an issue that's been a big issue for MTV and all the MTV watchers in the country who want to make young people a bigger part of the political process.And Congressman Rostenkowski and the other members of his committee are back in Washington, working on a plan that will help to bring the budget deficit down by over $500 billion over the next 5 years, so that you can grow up in an America that is not paralyzed by a crushing debt, as we have seen in the last 12 years.But I don't want to talk just about those issues today.I also want to talk about tomorrow, about your tomorrows and about what it will take for you to make the most of the future all of us who have already been in your place and school are trying to make.I've spent a lot of my time in Washington, in fact, most of my time, working on the economy and the health care crisis today, because I know that unless we can bring the deficit down and invest in jobs and technology and building a strong economy, America can't be what it ought to be.And I believe that unless we attack the problems of health care security and coverage and the enormous contribution that health care costs are making to the financial problems of this country, we can never restore real security to the American family or strength to the American economy or reduce the terrible deficit of this Government so that we can bring our budget into balance.So that's what I spend my time doing.But I also know that no matter what we do on these issues, unless each and every one of you is a productive, well-educated, well-trained citizen able to take advantage of the opportunities of the world you will live in but also able to meet the highly competitive challenges of people from all over the world who will be struggling for many of the same opportunities that you want, that nothing I can do will change your individual lives.You have to do that.And that's why the provision of excellence in education and real educational opportunities are so important.Those of you who have been able to go to this school or the other schools here represented can leave your high school with the confidence that you've had the opportunity to get a good education.But you should know that in the world you're living in, the average young American moving into the work force will change work seven or eight times in a lifetime.And more than ever before in the history of the country, what you are able to do in your work life, what you are able to earn, will be directly related not just to what you know today but what you can learn tomorrow.In the last&mdash;yeah, you can clap for that.That's a pretty good idea.Thanks.The clear evidence is that in the world in which you will live, you will need not only to make a personal commitment to learning and relearning throughout your lifetime but to getting at least&mdash;at least 2 years of education beyond high school and hopefully more.Now, more and more people have got this figured out.College enrollments have grown up; explosive enrollment increases at 2-year community colleges and technical schools have been seen.Young people have figured that out.But there are still some problems with it, one of which is purely financial.The college dropout rate is more than twice the high school dropout rate, and one big reason is, a lot of people cannot afford to go or, having gone, cannot afford to stay.How many of you want to go on to some form of further education when you get out of high school? Raise your hand.How many of you think you're going to need to borrow some money or get a scholarship or have some financial help to do it? Raise your hand.You know, last year in Illinois alone, almost 180,000 educational loans were made.Five million educational loans were made in America last year.Higher education is really important.It's important to you economically.It's important for reasons far more important than that, even.It promotes personal growth and gets you in contact with things that have happened in the past and ties you into this great civilization of ours.But it's all academic, to use an appropriate word, if you can't afford to go and stay.Interestingly enough, the cost of a college education is perhaps the only essential in a family's spending patterns that has gone up more rapidly than health care in the last 10 years.And that's one big reason that the college dropout rate has increased.More and more young people have to deal with this.On the average, in the country as a whole, tuition fees and room and board cost $5,240 a year at public institutions of higher education and $13,237 at private schools.The cost of these educations has gone up 126 percent in the last 10 years.That means that a lot of people who try to borrow money drop out and then can't repay the debt; others borrow the money and leave college with massive debts and don't know how to repay them.Still others might prefer when they graduate to be a teacher, for example, but they're afraid they can't meet their loan repayment schedule.They might wish to be a law enforcement officer or a police officer; they're afraid they can't meet their loan repayment schedule.That's a bad case of the tail wagging the dog.People actually deciding what to do with their lives based on the crushing burden of debt they have to get an education, the purpose of which was to be free to choose to do whatever you want to do with your life.We can do better than that.One of the reasons that I ran for President is that I wanted to change that, because I know no economic policy, no health care policy, no reduction in the deficit can change what is in your mind and whether you are able to do well in the world that you will live in.You have to do that.But my generation owes it to you to give you the chance to be able to afford to get a good college education, to go and to stay.A couple of weeks ago I unveiled a plan to do that based on four simple principles: First, we ought to lower the interest rates on the college loans that you borrow from&mdash;that you make.I don't know how many seniors here have already looked into college loans, but if you want a college loan that's guaranteed by the Federal Government, there's a lot of paperwork involved and a lot of hassle.That's because there are a lot of extra costs in there, from middle men, from banks, and from corporations, who profit from the current loan program.Your Senator, Paul Simon, was the first person who ever came to see me well over a year ago to say that we ought to make loans directly to students from the United States Government in a financially secure way so that we could cut out paperwork, cut out all the time it takes to apply for them, and eliminate excess profits from middle men.Every student borrower can enjoy a lower rate if we do this.And if we adopt the plan that I have basically developed in cooperation with Senator Simon and others, we can save the American taxpayers $4 billion over the next 5 years and make loans available to you at cheaper rates.I'd say that's a pretty good idea.The second thing we have to do is make it easier for students to pay the loan back.Today, the loan repayment obligation is directly related to how much you borrow, whether you have a job or whatever your job pays.What I want to do is to give every American young person who borrows money to get a 2-year or a 4-year education after high school the option of paying the money back based on how much you make, so that you can never be saddled with a debt burden greater than a certain percentage of your income.That way, there will never be an incentive not to be a teacher, not to be a police officer, not to work with kids in trouble, not to do whatever you want to do.You will be able to pay your loan back because it will be a percentage of your income.Regardless of how much you borrowed, we'll work it out so that the monthly payment is never too burdensome.That means nobody will be able to say they can't afford a college loan.The third thing we want to do is to give tens of thousands of you the chance to earn credit against these loans before you go to college or while you're in college or to work them off after you get out of college, not by paying them off but by serving your country in a community service program, working with the elderly, working with other kids, working with housing programs, working with things that need to be done in the neighborhood or in nearby neighborhoods, or if you do it after you get out of college, working as teachers or police officers or in other needed areas in underserved communities in America.Just think of it.We could have tens of thousands of people who could pay off their loans entirely by giving a year or two of their lives to make their countries and their communities better.Finally&mdash;this is the one kicker&mdash;I hope you will clap for this, too, because it's important.There is an unbelievable default rate.We lose about $3 billion a year from people who don't pay their loans back.Now, there's a reason for that, and I'll explain it more later.But one of the things we do, if we're going to loan you the money directly, we're going to collect the money directly, too, involving the tax records at tax time so you can't beat the bill.People who borrow money, once you make it possible for them to repay it, should not be able to welsh on the loans.That undermines the ability of children coming along behind you to borrow the money.People ought to have to pay the loans back if we make it possible for them to do it.Everybody ought to have to do that.Now, this will make it possible for millions of young people to borrow money to go to college.I don't propose to weaken the Pell grant programs and the other scholarship programs; we want to keep strengthening them.But this will make it possible for millions of people to borrow money, never have to worry about whether they'll be able to pay it back.You won't have to pay it back until you go to work.When you do go to work, you can pay it back as a small percentage of your income.You will have to pay it back and will do it all at lower cost.This will open the doors of college education to millions of Americans.Now, you might ask yourself, Well, if it's that simple, why is this man here talking to me about it? Why don't you just go do it? Here's why.A lot of people are doing well with the present system.They're making a lot of money out of the present system.There are 7,800 lenders today, people making the student loans.There are 46 different Agencies that guarantee these loans against failure.Then, there are all these people who service the loans and who buy the loans in big packages in ways that you couldn't even begin to understand, probably, but they're all making good money out of the present system.It's confusing and it's costly, and the more money that goes to other things, the less money that's available to provide low-cost loans to the students of America.Typically, the student takes out a loan from a bank, and then the bank takes the note that you sign when you get the loan and sells it to a corporation.The corporation then makes a profit by packaging the loan to someone else.And the loan is ultimately guaranteed by whom? All of us, the American taxpayers.So nobody can lose any money on it.Now, the biggest middle man in the whole thing is called Sallie Mac, the Student Loan Marketing Association.Last year, lenders made a total profit of $1 billion on student loans.Sallie Mac made $394 million.And between 1986 and 1991&mdash;listen to this; this is a group that helps us get student loans, right, which should not be a big profitmaking operation&mdash;the costs of this corporation went down by 21 percent and its profits went up by 172 percent.But you didn't get the benefits of it; someone else did.Interestingly enough, banks make more profits and more guaranteed profits on student loans than on car loans or mortgages, but there's no risk.They don't have to worry if the student doesn't pay back the loan.Why? Because the Government will send them 90 cents on the dollar.And as all of you know if you follow this at all, there's not much incentive for a bank to come recover the loan because it costs more than 10 percent of the loan to hire a lawyer and go through a lawsuit and file all the papers and do all that.So every year, the Government just writes a lot of checks to people for the loans that students don't repay.The taxpayers foot the bill, and that's all money that we can't spend loaning money to you and people like you to go to college.The system is not very good.The lenders do well, but the people who need to borrow the money for a college education are hurt as a result.And the taxpayers get hit coming and going: not enough money made available for student loans, too much money going out to increase the deficit by paying off loans that never get repaid.So, you might say, Why don't we change this? Because in the system we have, the people that are making plenty of money out of the present system will fight it.And they will hire lobbyists who make their money by trying to influence the Congress.No sooner had I even mentioned changing this system than Congress was deluged with lobbyists.The biggest organization, Sallie Mac alone, supposed to be in the business of helping you get money to go to college, has already hired seven of the most powerful lobbyists in Washington to try to stop this process from changing.Now, there are a lot of people in Washington who want to keep the status quo.A lot of people don't want to lower the deficit, either.How did we get such a big national debt? How did the debt go from $1 trillion in 1980 to $4 trillion in 1992? Because we cut&mdash;Audience member.Republicans.No, because we did what was popular.It wasn't just the Republicans; they had The White House, but let's be fair.Because how do you run up a big deficit? How do you run up a big deficit? The President proposes, and the Congress disposes.And it's popular in the short run to cut taxes and increase spending, right? I mean, that's popular.It's easy.I'll cut your taxes and send you a check.That's good, right? The problem is, is that at some point you run up debt after debt after debt after debt.So what am I trying to do? What's not popular? I'm trying to cut spending and increase taxes, mostly on very wealthy Americans but not entirely, because we all have to try to recover our financial future.And I'm trying to do it in a way that preserves some money to invest in your education and new technologies for your jobs.But there are a lot of people who are making money out of a system that cuts taxes and increases spending, and it's not very popular to raise the money and cut the spending.That's the way it is here.There are a lot of people who are doing very well out of this system.Now, why am I telling you this? Because it is your future on the line, and if you would like to have a system in which it is easier to borrow money to go to college, 2 or 4 years, and which it will be easier to pay it back and in which more of your tax money will be spent to benefit you and your education and your future, then you need to tell your Members of Congress, without regard to their political party, that you would like to have a better future, and this is a change that you want made.This country is a very great country.It has been around for more than 200 years because every time we had to make real changes, we did it.Now the challenges we face are very much within our borders.It really bothers me that there are so many kids every year who are lost to the future as well as to themselves because of crime and drugs.It really bothers me that so many people drop out of college and don't get the future that they ought to have just because of the money involved.It bothers me that we spend so much more than any other country in the world on health care, but we don't provide health coverage to all our people, and all the other advanced countries do.And it bothers me that we're not creating jobs for you, but we're piling up debt for your future.I believe we can do better.But we can only do it if we'll tell each other the truth, keep our eyes wide open, and if you will say, hey, it is my future.Look, I've lived most of my life.Unless I beat the odds and live to be 94, I've lived more than half my life&mdash;or 92.I can't even add anymore.I've lived more than half my life unless I live to be 92 years old.It is your life that's on the line.It is your future that's on the line.And our job now is to open it up for you and to face the problems of this time so that you have the same chance to live the American dream that your forebears did.That is our job, and you can help us do it.Again, let me say, I thank you for letting me come here.I look forward to answering your questions.But when I'm gone, if you don't remember anything else I said, just remember this: There's a plan in Washington to provide more student loans at a more affordable rate so that more people can go to college and stay, but we have to have the courage to change to adopt it.Thank you very much.Moderator.Thank you, President Clinton.We understand that you have some time where you could answer some questions from our students.I'm a junior from Fenton High School, and I am wondering what the Government is doing about the families that are defaulting on the student loans? Well, we try to collect it.But the problem now is that very often the people who don't pay are unemployed, or very often the people who don't pay&mdash;there's another problem with this, by the way&mdash;are people who got educations from trade schools that couldn't deliver what they promised.That is, they said, We'll train you, and you'll be able to get a good job, and you'll be able to get a high salary.And a lot of these schools have been able to rip off this system for years because they could charm&mdash;they would get all their kids into these programs through student loans, and then they didn't have to worry about whether they finished the program or got jobs, because they already had the student loan money.So what we're trying to do is, number one, be tougher with the schools.If they're not good schools and they're not really educating the students so the students can repay the loans, we're trying to stop those schools from being eligible for it.Number two, we're looking at ways to toughen up the enforcement.Here's the way I want to change it so we can collect from almost everybody.If I said to you, look, I'll give you a loan and you don't have to repay it until you actually get a job so you're earning the money.And then you may borrow&mdash;let's say you borrow $5,000 and she borrows $10,000 and she borrows $20,000, and you all take jobs earning $30,000 a year, right? The people who borrowed more money would be given the option of paying that loan back as a limited percentage of their income, even though it would take them longer to pay it back.At least they would be able to make the payments, and they wouldn't be defaulting.And then if they didn't pay it back, we would know that they didn't because the Government would have the records, and we would enforce it just like we enforce taxes.In other words, you couldn't beat the bill.If you had a job and you had an income, you would have to pay it back.But right now, we get the worst of all worlds.We let somebody else make the loan, and we tell them if it's not paid back, we'll pay 90 percent of the loan, and then after all the time goes by, we've got to figure out how to collect it.So we're doing better, but we can do much, much better if we clean out a lot of the system that's there and go at it directly.Who had a microphone? Anybody? Yes, in the back.But let me say, I believe we need to increase the emphasis on education, prevention, and rehabilitation because we know that's what works.That is, for several years in the 1980's, drug use went down among most groups of young people, largely because they figured out it would kill them.In other words, people decided to change their behavior from the inside out.Now, that does not&mdash;you can't sacrifice law enforcement to that.I think we should do two other things.Let me just run it out real quickly.The second thing we should do is to adopt law enforcement strategies that will reinforce people taking responsibility for themselves and increase the likelihood that they will move off drugs or out of the drug culture.I'll just give you two examples.One is community policing.Thirty-five years ago there were three policemen on the street in America for every crime committed.Today, there are three crimes for every policeman.It's very hard, therefore, to have enough police to walk the streets, to know the neighbors, to know the kids, and to be a force for preventing crime.Where that has happened, it has worked.The man I named to be the drug czar in our administration, Lee Brown, was the police chief in Atlanta, Houston, and New York City.And when he left New York, in the areas where they had put in community policing, the crime rate was going down.In some of those neighborhoods, for the first time in 30 years, there had been a reversal in the crime rate.So I think you have to do that.And the final thing I want to say is we still have a big stake in working with our friends and allies in other countries to try to stop drugs from coming into this country.And we are in the process now of reexamining whether there's anything else we can do to reduce the flow of drugs into the country.But I'll tell you one thing, if we all decided we'd stop taking them, the flow would dry up because there wouldn't be any demand.So we can't just worry about blaming people from outside.Go ahead.What I'm curious about is, what is being cut back in bases, arms, manpower.My curiosity is because I've enlisted in the U.S.Army.And is it going to effect my future if I decide to use it as a career and go my 20 years or anything like that.Will it affect me? Can you all hear his question? I'll repeat the question.He said he was concerned about military cutbacks.He wants to know what the nature of the cutbacks are, how far they will go.He's enlisted in the Army.Will that undermine his ability to make the Army a career because of the cutbacks.Let me say, first of all, you know why the cutbacks are occurring.The cutbacks are occurring because an enormous percentage of our military force was directed against the Soviet Union, and it no longer exists.A lot of our nuclear arsenal was because they had a big nuclear arsenal, and we were positioned against them, and we had planes and ships supporting that, as well as people on the ground with landbased missiles.A lot of our military forces were positioned against all the troops they used to have in Eastern Europe, which have been withdrawn, and the military positioning they had around the world.So we have been able to-in fact, we've been obligated to reduce defense spending, starting in about '86 or '87 because of the receding nature of the threat.And that's good on the whole.Now, the world is still a pretty dangerous place, and the United States is still the only comprehensive military power.And we have to be careful how we reduce that defense spending and how much we do it.Right now, we're doing it across the board in three areas: We're reducing military personnel with the view toward going down to a base force of about 1.4 million over the next 5 years, down from over 2.5 million just a few years ago.So that's a lot of people that have been mustered out, including all volunteers, people who wanted to serve their country, many of whom would like to have stayed longer.So the answer to your question is, if we have a smaller base force, it will be more competitive to get into and to stay in the Armed Forces.The recruitment has already been scaled back.So if you've been recruited and if you're going in under the new, smaller recruitment quotas, you'll probably have a reasonable chance to stay in a good, long while if you choose to do it.But not so many good young people will.In that way, it's kind of sad, because the military has done a magnificent job of training and educating people, of inculcating them with good values and good work habits as well as good education.So that's one of the&mdash;kind of the down sides.The second thing we're doing is closing bases, and that's very unpopular.But you can't just cut the forces and not close the bases.And the third thing we've had to do is to cut back on a number of weapons procurements, which cost jobs in the defense industry.So, on balance, this has been a good thing, but I want you to understand there are some bad consequences to it.And one of the struggles that I expect to have constantly for the next 4 years is to try to convince people in the Congress that as we cut defense we need to be reinvesting that money in education and technology in America to create jobs to replace those lost in defense.And thank you for being willing to serve your country.President, I think the American people have become increasingly disenchanted with the lack of progress in our Government.How are you going to convince the American people and all the Members of Congress that your programs are good ones, and how are you going to break the filibusters that have been&mdash; Well, we've only had one.We broke them all but one.Keep in mind that I've just been there 100 days, and I had 12 years of a different direction before I took office.It's hard to turn it around in 100 days.I'm actually quite optimistic.The Congress passed the outline of the budget I presented which, as I explained earlier, is a very tough thing, you know, to bring the deficit down in a record time, the first time in 17 years under Democrats and Republican Presidents the Congress had ever passed the budget resolution within the time limit.So I think we're moving fairly rapidly.Just shortly after I took office, Congress passed the Family and Medical Leave Act, guaranteeing people the right to take a little time off from work when they have a sick child or a sick parent or a baby is born, without losing their jobs.That had gone through 8 years of fights and two vetoes.The Congress is trying to pass today this motor voter bill, which would really open up the political process to millions of Americans.So I think we are making progress.Now, let me also tell you that some of this stuff is really hard.I mean the reason that these things have not been done before is that we've done easy things for 12 years.What I'm asking the Congress to do are things that are really hard, and it may take a while to do it.But I'm not prepared to say, at the moment anyway, that we've lost the battle to gridlock.I don't agree with the minority of Senators who filibustered the jobs bill.But that was not just a political battle; that was an idea battle.A lot of them thought that we shouldn't spend any money on anything until we pass the overall budget which reduces the deficit, even though I knew we were going to.My view was: We're going to pass this budget, we're going to reduce the deficit, and we've got to get some jobs in this economy.So that was an issue I didn't win on.I'm not going to win every issue I'm fighting.But I believe that we have a real chance to make this Government work, and I'm basically quite optimistic about it.The one thing I would urge you not to do, any of you, is to put too much faith in just the day-to-day development of the news.You have to take a long-term view of this.And we've had this health care problem for a long time.We've had this economic problem for a long time.And in just a very short time we've been able to put these issues back on the national agenda and move them forward.So I think what you need to do is to remind everybody you can remind&mdash;if you want to know what you can do and what the American people can do, it's to try to make everybody think in a less partisan way, not worry about the fights between Republicans and Democrats, and think more every day about what are the problems of this country.And if you don't like what President Clinton says, what's your alternative? In other words, let's just keep moving the ball forward.What I try to do is to put these problems high on the national agenda and try to ask people to lay down their partisan armor and look at these problems in a new and different way and keep pushing the ball forward.So if you don't like what I want to do about it, then if you're not going to support that, then come up with some alternative so we can do something.The worst thing we can do is stay in paralysis.Let's do something.That, I think, ought to be the message.I'm wondering if you're planning to continue this quota system or will it be based on talent and merit and needs straight across the board? There may be certain minority scholarship programs in certain universities.But the program that I would speak of, both national service and the student loan program, would be available across-the-board.I mean&mdash;and I believe-and the student loan program should be available across-the-board virtually without regard to income once you can guarantee that the repayment is going to be there so you don't have to worry about loaning too much money.That's what I think.I favor broad-based and inclusive programs and national service will also be broad-based and inclusive.I think you have to make efforts to include people from all races and income groups, and I would want to see that done because we have a big stake in making sure that we close the disparity in income and race of people getting an education, because if you come out the other end of the educational system, then the income differences tend to vanish.But I don't think anyone should be excluded, and I don't want to ration this program.I want to open this program to all Americans.Clinton, I'd like to know what your views are on the space program, if you are in favor of cutting anything or improving anything? In general, I support strongly the space program and the NASA budget.I have some problems with the space station itself for a couple of reasons.One, it's a hugely expensive program, and there's a lot of debate within NASA itself about whether the old designs should be continued, whether we need that space station design.Secondly, it's had staggering cost overruns.Every time we turn around they're coming back for hundreds of millions of more dollars.And with the deficit the way it is and all these other problems, we can't afford it.So what NASA is doing now is trying to redesign the space station and come up with a multi-year space program that I hope we can get strong bipartisan support for.I think it would be a big mistake for America to drastically cut back its role in space.Now I've been criticized for cutting back on the space station, but I haven't cut back the NASA budget.We have cut back the rate of increase that they want to cover all the cost overruns for anything that happens.I just don't think we can do that with the old space station design.So we're now looking at three alternatives for the space station to take a new and modified course.But I think it would be a great mistake for America to withdraw from space exploration and from work in space.For one thing, it's one of the ways that we may find answers to a lot of our environmental problems as well as to continue to build our scientific and technological base after we cut defense.So I hope we can continue to support it.President Go ahead.We'll take one more and then I'll take this young man's.Go ahead.President, I was wondering with all the news about Bosnia, do you see any differences in sending troops to Bosnia where you were strongly opposed to civil war in Vietnam in the late sixties? Well, first of all, I do.That's a good question.But I have never advocated the United States unilaterally sending troops to Bosnia to fight on one side or the other of the civil war.Let me just say what's complicated about it.There plainly is a civil war in Bosnia that is, among other things, a fight primarily between the Serbs and the Muslims but also involving the Croatians.It is complicated by the fact that Serbia, a separate country, has intervened in it, and complicated by the fact that the United Nations before Bosnia, the nation of Bosnia was even recognized, imposed an arms embargo in the area.But the practical impact of the arms embargo that the United Nations imposed was to give the entire weaponry of the Yugoslav Army to the Serbian Bosnians and deprive any kind of equal weaponry to the people fighting against them.So the global community had, not on purpose, but inadvertently, has had a huge impact on the outcome of that war in ways that have been very bad.My position has been pretty simple and straightforward from the beginning.I think that without the United States unilaterally getting in, or without even&mdash;I don't think the United Nations should enter the war on one side or the other.But I think there is much more that we can do to induce the parties to stop the fighting, to do what we can to stop this idea of ethnic cleansing: murdering people, raping children, and doing terrible acts of violence solely because of people's religion.Biologically, there is not much difference between the Muslims, the Croatians, and the Serbians there.The ethnic differences are rooted in religious and historical factors.Thirdly, we want to try to confine that conflict so it doesn't spread into other places and involve other countries, like Albania and Greece and Turkey, which could have the impact of undermining the peace in Europe and the growth and stability of democracies there.So I think the United Nations, the world community can do more in that regard.That's quite a different thing than what happened in Vietnam where the United States essentially got involved in what was a civil war on one side or the other.There are some remarkable similarities to it which should give us caution about doing that.There are similarities to that.There are similarities to Lebanon.But that does not mean, just because&mdash;I wouldn't propose doing exactly what the United States did in Vietnam.That does not mean that the United States should not consider doing something more, especially if we can get the Europeans who are after all closer to it, who have a more immediate stake in it, to try to help us to stop the ethnic cleansing, the continued fighting, and minimize dramatically the risk of the war spreading.So that's what we're struggling for an answer to.It's a very, very difficult problem.President, what do you feel we as students can do to better the U.S.educational system? Read more.Read more.I think you can read more.I think you can establish tutoring groups in schools where the students that are doing well help those which aren't.There's a lot of evidence that by the time somebody reaches your age that you all have more influence on one another than I would on any of you.And there's a lot of evidence in schools that are succeeding that when students work with each other either in the same classroom or across grade lines, that the overall performance of the school goes up.Interestingly enough, there are a lot of studies even showing at elementary schools that this is true and certainly true in high schools.So I think one of the things that I have seen work repeatedly over the last dozen years that I've spent countless hours in schools with students and teachers is that kind of working together.The third thing that I think you can do is to speak out in a way for a culture of learning and for good values in the schools.I think that's important.I think if the students want a school to be a place where learning is valued and where everybody counts and where violence or drugs or other bad behavior are not tolerated, the students can have more to do with getting rid of it than anything else if it is a bad thing, if everybody looks down on it.And I think that can make a huge difference.It's so limited what the rest of us can do to help the schools unless there is a right sort of feeling in the hearts of the young people involved.And I think anything we can do to convince all students that they count, that they matter, that we need them all, that they shouldn't drop out, that they can learn, anything we can do in that regard school by school, class by class, year by year, is going to make education in this country a lot better.The last thing I think you can do is to decide what you think is wrong with education and how we can make it better and tell people like me about it.In other words, tell us from your perspective how we can make your schools a lot better, what you need, how we can give you a better future, what we're not doing that we could be doing.Those are the things you can do.Moderator.President Clinton, I understand we have time for one more question.I have a question about women in the military.I heard that they're going to be able to go in combat now.Is it going to become a law that they're going to be drafted also? I'm sorry I didn't hear you.Go ahead.So I'm wondering, are they going to be able to be drafted like men? First of all, men are not drafted.We have an all volunteer service.There are no draftees.Anyone who goes into the service is like this young man.The men or women choose to go.And we have a lot of people who want to go now because of the justifiably high esteem in which our military is held.I can tell you that you can talk to any career service officer, and he or she will tell you that we have the best educated, best trained, best equipped, highest morale military service we have ever had.And it also, by the way, is the most diverse one we've ever had, opening up more opportunities to women and to all members of all races that we've ever had.And yet it's the best educated, best trained, best equipped, best able military service we have ever had although it's under a lot of stress now because of all the downsizing.The Service Chiefs in the Joint Chiefs of Staff have decided that they ought to open up some more combat roles to women, principally on combat ships.The Navy, for example&mdash;I bet a lot of you don't know this&mdash;the Navy now has three noncombat ships under the command of women, the United States Navy does.But Admiral Kelso, the Chief of Naval Operations, had decided that some more combat ship roles should be open to women.And then there was also a decision made that women ought to be eligible to fly combat missions in the face of clear evidence that the airplanes they fly today require not strength so much as response, the capacity for quick and agile response.And there's a lot of evidence that women are at least as good in some of those functions as men, so the Joint Chiefs made that decision.That was a military decision in which I did not intervene at all.I think if the evidence supports it, it's a very good decision.But I want you to know it was made based on the evidence in the case and made by the military, and they deserve the credit.Well, I could do this all day long.You have been terrific and I'm very proud of you, and you've asked wonderful questions, all of them were very good.I wish you well.Have a good day.And don't stop thinking about these educational issues.Thank you very much.",clinton
"Thank you very much, Mr.Vice President, for that wonderful introduction and for being such a great partner in the campaign of 1992 and in this administration.I think it is fair to say that Vice President Gore has already exercised a larger role in this administration than perhaps any Vice President in the history of this country.And I hope he will continue to do so.I'm honored to be here with Ralph Neas and with my longtime friend Benjamin Hooks.Don't you just love to hear Ben talk? I mean, really, I could hear him intone those poems from now until tomorrow morning, reminding me of the rhythms of my childhood and the faith of our parents.I'm proud to be here with all of you tonight not only because of what you have done for the last four decades and more but because of what together we must do now.I'm proud of your commitment to civil rights.I'm proud to be here with our Attorney General, Janet Reno, who is the embodiment of that.I thank you for the vote of the national board of the leadership conference today to support the nomination of Lani Guinier to be Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights.I want to say a special word of support for Lani Guinier.I went to law school with her, and I announced at the Justice Department the other day when we announced all of our Assistant Attorneys General that she had actually sued me once.And I nominated her anyway.So the Senate ought to be able to put up with a little controversy in the cause of civil rights and go on and confirm her so we can get about the business of America.I want to say, too, how honored I am to be here with your honorees.My friend Dorothy Height: From the freedom schools in Mississippi to the Black Family Reunion, what a guiding spirit she has been to all of us.I want to take my hat off to Raul Yzaguirre for his leading voice.Over 20 years ago, I first came in contact with La Raza as a movement and a commitment.And I have watched them over these years help people all across the country with the practical problems of life which give real meaning to the idea of civil rights, when you can actually live in a decent house and have a decent job and know your kids are going to get a decent education and know that you're going to be treated fairly no matter what your race is.I want to say, too, how very much I admire Justin Dart for all the work that he's done as Chair of the President's Commission on Employment of People with Disabilities and leader in making the Americans with Disabilities Act come to life.You know, Justin, every time we went anywhere in the campaign and had a rally, we always had a section for people with disabilities.Today I went to a suburb north of Chicago, in a heavily Republican community, as it turned out, to meet with a bunch of students from the high school that I was visiting and other high schools and people in the community.And we had a big section there for the students with disabilities.And I was thinking as I was coming over here tonight, a lot of those kids are where they are today because of what you did&mdash;and you ought to be proud of that&mdash;sitting in the front of the row so they can ask the President their questions and shake hands with the President; instead of being overlooked, being uplifted.I say that to you to make one introductory point.I've been here for 100 days and a sum, fighting to break the gridlock in Washington.And sometimes I think the biggest gridlock of all is the gridlock in our minds, the hold that foolish notions have on our imaginations.I have been roundly attacked by people on the extreme right trying to make me look like some radical left-winger because I had this crazy notion that I ought to have an administration that would have some diversity and give women as well as men and people of color as well as people who look like me the chance to serve if they could meet high standards of excellence.And there are people who say, well&mdash;and I see these relentless articles in the paper&mdash;oh, that's why no appointments are being made.Well, so in 100 days I show up at the Justice Department, and I ask for the totals: Pass me the envelope, please.Where are they? And I expected to see the shameless right in sackcloth and ashes, saying that we had falsely accused this poor President in promoting gridlock.But they have no shame.And I'm proud that I'm going to serve my country.And I know we've got to cut the military budget, but I want to know if you're going to cut it so much that I can't give my whole career to my country if I want to.And I thought to myself, why doesn't somebody point out to all these people who have attacked us for trying to open the doors of opportunities that the number one, most successful institution in the United States of America for giving opportunities to women and people of color are the United States military branches.They have done it with a commitment to excellence and opportunity.And what we've got to do is to prove that the rest of us can do so as well.And we ought not to make this a partisan issue, and the guardians of gridlock should stop trying to use it to move arguments around that indicate that there's somehow something wrong with the President who believes that everybody who can serve ought to have the chance to do so.This administration is committed to the enforcement of the civil rights laws.This administration is also committed to programs like national service that give everybody the possibility of being part of a new era of civic responsibility.This administration is committed to guaranteeing that every American is entitled to a fair chance at the brass ring but even more important, to empowering people to seize those opportunities, to moving beyond the incredible gridlock in the mind of this town that you either have to give somebody something for nothing or take it all off the table.Why don't we behave in Washington the way people behave in their normal lives? We need opportunity and responsibility.Why don't we stop making these nutty arguments that imply that everything in life is an either-or proposition: We're either going to write somebody a check and bust the Government budget, or we're just going to stick it to them and walk away.That's not the way life works.You know, civil rights should embody a country that works.We don't want to guarantee everybody equal employment opportunities when there are no jobs.Does that mean that we have to sacrifice one and not the other? No, it means you should have a President who will pursue both, walking and chewing gum at the same time.That's what this is about.Is that right? We want to guarantee everybody an equal opportunity to get an education, but wouldn't it be nice if the education you're getting is also better? It's not either-or.We want to guarantee everybody the right to health care and family security through health care, but wouldn't it be nice if you live in a rural area or in the heart of a big city if there happens to be a clinic to visit? I just am amazed after 100 days to find that a lot of the gridlock that has gripped this city for so long is in the imposition of what one writer had called false choices on all of us who are supposed to make policy.It never occurred to me that I should appoint somebody who wasn't qualified to a job.You know, I don't wake up in the morning thinking, you know, I need to find some female Latino who is totally unqualified to put in a job.But that is the kind of rhetoric you see running beneath so much of the characterization when we try to change 12 years of attitudes.The same people that were criticizing the previous administrations for being insensitive to civil rights immediately turned around and say, Oh, there's too much, too much attention being given to ethnicity and gender, and that's why no appointments are being made.So the record comes in, and I'm still waiting for the acknowledgement.I tell you, folks, I refuse to believe that we cannot go forward together, that we cannot set an example, that we cannot make progress.I refuse to believe that you can't be committed to civil rights and to civic responsibility.I refuse to believe that we can't create economic opportunity by empowering people to seize control of their destiny and changing the Government's policies.I think that if this leadership council should have any mission today, it should be to break through those barriers that push us all into one extreme camp or the other and make us mute in the face of reality and common sense.Surely we can bring the experience of our own lives and the lives of our fellow Americans beyond the borders of this city to the policy-making process that will dominate Washington for the next year.That is what we ought to do if we want civil rights to come alive in this country.You know, when I ran for this job I spent a lot of time in African-American churches because I always had, and because I felt at home.When I got this job and I sought to protect the religious and civil liberties of every American, it was because I wanted mine protected and because I have a sharp memory of what it was like to live in a society where half the people I knew, because of their color, were treated as second-class citizens.I also have a sharp memory of those who had the courage to try to change that position.And now that I am President, I want you to know that I'll make my mistakes from time to time, but I'm going to keep trying to move the ball forward.I believe we can make advances.I don't believe that our fights are over.I know that there are still civil rights battles to be fought, but I know that they need to be fought today in the context of making a real difference in real people's lives.And we should not be intimidated, those of us who believe in the cause of civil rights for all Americans, into thinking that somehow that can be separated from the fight for economic justice and economic progress and making our free enterprise system work better.We should not let people who basically don't care whether we make progress in civil rights think that you can separate civil rights from the fight for substantive improvements in education and for meaningful advances in health care or any other area of our national life.Let us resolve tonight that we're going to spend the next 4 years breaking down the gridlock by tearing down the artificial barriers in people's minds to bringing us together, saying we don't have a person to waste and lifting up everybody's God-given potential and doing what we can to see that they achieve it.Thank you very much, and God bless you.",clinton
"Please sit down, ladies and gentlemen.Good morning.It's great to see all of you here in the Rose Garden.I want to thank the Members of Congress who have joined us for this ceremony, and welcome all of you small business people and your families from all across America here to the White House for this important day.This is an extra special day to celebrate the winners of the small business people of the year awards, because today we're also going to have the oath of office for the new Administrator of the Small Business Administration, Erskine Bowles.I chose Erskine for a very simple reason, because he's a business person and not a politician.Too often in the past, the SBA has been the province of politics too much and business too little.This man has devoted his life to helping people start businesses, to helping them grow their businesses, to helping them reach out beyond the borders of their communities, to State and regional and national and international markets.He really understands what it's like to start and to keep going a business enterprise.His plans for the Agency include a plan to improve the management and outreach to determine what we can do to actually create more success stories in the small business community.He's already met, I know, with many of you who are here for this celebration.But that's just the beginning.I think you will see the most energetic, connected, and continuous effort to reach out to small business that the SBA has ever given to the American small business community.Now, I'd like to introduce Erskine and Judge James Dixon Phillips, Jr., of the Court of Appeals of the 4th Circuit in Durham, North Carolina, who will administer the oath of office.Erskine's wife, Grandall Bowles, will hold the Bible, and then they will take it over from there.Mr.Bowles then expressed his gratitude to the President and enumerated his priorities for SBA.I predict that over the next 4 years, small business men and women in every State in America will come to see Erskine Bowles as the best advocate they ever had.And I assure you that he is going to have a real influence on our economic policy.Some evidence of that is the presence here today of the two other Members of my Cabinet, Ron Brown, the Secretary of Commerce, and Mickey Kantor, our U.S.Trade Representative.We are going to have a coordinated policy for small business.We have to have the Commerce Department, we have to have the Trade Office, we have to have the Treasury Department if we're going to attack all these issues.And I'm very, very proud of the team that we've got working on it.Let me just mention one or two other things about the small business economy.We have spent most of our time in the last 3 months or so in meetings in this White House talking about the economy and talking about health care and its impact on the economy.Over and over and over, we come back to a central fact of the American economy in the last 12 years.In every year of the last 12 years, the biggest companies in America have reduced employment in this country, even as they were increasing productivity, even as their profits went up, even as their stock values went through the roof and Wall Street reached all-time highs, in every year.Some of that is because of being involved in other countries in a global economy.A lot of it is just using the technology of new productivity to have machines do more work, or have people do more work, overtime, and more part-time workers.But the bottom line is, in every year employment has been reduced by the biggest businesses in this country.In every year until about 3 years ago, the reduction in employment by big business was more than offset by the increase in employment by small businesses in America and by the startup of new businesses.Then, about 3 years ago, that too came to a halt because of a national and international recession, because of the credit crunch, because of the burgeoning costs of health care on smaller businesses and all the extra additional costs of hiring one more worker, whether it's worker's comp or some other cost or the Social Security costs.The extra added costs to small business of hiring additional workers meant that, over the last 2 or 3 years, small businesses, even when they were growing, have relied more and more on overtime, more and more on temporary workers, and less on adding to the job base of America.We have talked about this endlessly in these walls here, trying to come up with policies that would address that, trying to reward the spirit, the grit, the entrepreneurialism, the creativity of you and millions of Americans like you all over this country.I have seen, I suppose, being a former Governor of a small State, as many small businesses up close as virtually anybody who ever occupied this office.I have more than a healthy respect for the fact that you now employ a majority of America's workers and create a huge majority of America's new jobs.Just a couple of days ago, as I'm sure you all know, I went out to Ohio and to Illinois.And when I finished my speech in downtown Cleveland to the City Club, before we went out to the airport, I told my entourage with no planning that I wanted to go back to a small business that I came across in the primary in Parma, which is a suburb of Cleveland, to visit a woman named Mary Poldruhi, who became a friend of mine in the election.She started a business called Parma's Pierogis.And she did it as a Polish American, and no bank would loan her any money.So she got a telephone book and called hundreds of people in the telephone book with Polish surnames until she found 80 people who agreed to put up $3,000 apiece to start her business, which she rims with her family and a couple of friends and which has done very, very well indeed.That is the sort of spirit and creativity that I'm sure&mdash;I see a lot of you nodding because you identify with that experience in your own lives.I was so impressed with this woman and her family that, literally, I was sitting there in Cleveland we just decided to go back and see her and see how the business was doing and what could be done to try to stabilize this environment and make it better.I want to talk about just two or three of the things we're trying to do.Erskine already mentioned the initiative that Secretary Bentsen organized to have the five major financial Departments of the Federal Government work on trying to simplify regulations and end the credit crunch.A lot of business people tell me that it takes a little time for the orders we issue in Washington to manifest themselves in the bank down the street.And if that's not happening, that is one of the things that Erskine Bowles is here to address.We are determined to change the environment which has led to so much withdrawing of capital when it ought to be out there plentiful now, given the economic conditions, for new loans for good prospects.Secondly, in the proposal that the Congress is now considering to bring the deficit down, there is a sweeping new proposal to provide a huge capital gains cuts for new investments and new enterprises to try to start more small businesses, and I hope it will have your support.We've also asked for an extension of the 25 percent deduction of health care costs for the self-employed, which I think is very important.Finally, we are in intense negotiations at this moment, as we speak, to guarantee that whatever comes out of the House Ways and Means Committee in the tax bill will include a substantial increase in incentives for small business people to reinvest in their own companies.So these are the kinds of things that I hope will help us to generate more jobs and will support your efforts.There is also a community development bank initiative and a big enterprise zone initiative that I think will help to spark more small businesses in distressed areas and rural communities and big cities.But over the long run, we also have to have a healthy financial climate in the country.And that means that we must pass a budget this year that takes a strong step to bring this deficit down.Ever since the election was over when the then-Secretary-designate of the Treasury, Lloyd Bentsen, went on television and said we are going to have a tough deficit reduction plan and outlined some of the elements of it, interest rates have been going down in this country.Mortgage rates are at 20-year lows.The business journals say that if we could keep interest rates down this low for another few months, over $100 billion will be released into this economy through refinancing of home mortgages and business loans and other things for new investment and new opportunities.Now, we know that someday interest rates will go up again, but we want it to happen when the economy starts to boom again.And we want the interest rates to stay down while we refinance and get as much new money as we can at low interest rates back into this economy.A year ago, only 47 percent of the American people thought, for example, that the next generation of Americans would be able to afford a new home.Just a couple of weeks ago a bipartisan poll said 74 percent of the people now think that, because we're making a strong effort to bring the deficit down to hold the interest rates down.I wish there were easy and painless ways to do that, but it requires cuts and tax increases.I'm going up to New York after I leave you today to announce at the Cooper Union that I am going to support, strongly, the proposition that we guarantee the American people two things: number one is, no tax increases without the spending cuts, and number two is, that tax increases will go to reduce the deficit, by creating a legally separate deficit reduction trust fund which will tell you where your money is going.I think that this will do as much as anything else we can do to make your lives healthier over the long run.Let me finally make one last point.We didn't get into our economic difficulties overnight nor at the hand of any particular party.There is enough blame to go around, and there will be enough credit to go around, if we work our way out of it.I want to reiterate what I have tried to say since the day I became President: I do not seek a Democratic or a Republican resolution of America's problems.I would like for us to define an American solution that goes beyond the paralyzing debates of the past.In spite of the fact that we've had a little of that here, there's also a lot of evidence that we are moving beyond it.We've passed a budget resolution in record time.The Congress passed the motor voter bill yesterday which had strong opposition, but it's a great thing, and the young people of this country are very excited because it will make it easier for them to vote.In the last election we had more young people voting than any time in 20 years, and there was a sense that we could give our political system back to the people who are the true owners of it.So I think there is every reason to hope that we can still build a sense of possibility and hope and progress among people of good faith in both parties, and I want to encourage that.And it ought to be rooted in ideas and in action, because that's really the sort of thing that brought all of you here today.I hardly ever have had what you would call a conventional political discussion with a small business person.You know, I mean, if I go in and I talk to somebody about, can you afford health care? What's your coverage? What are the options? What's the matter with the insurance coverage? How big is the pool you're in?-the words Democrat and Republican never come up.Somebody says they went down to the bank, and they couldn't get a loan, and here were the problems, and look at this stack of paper from the Small Business Administration I had to fill out.Nobody ever put a political context on it.And I hope that we can focus our attention here on our problems and ask openly what should be done about them in the same way that you and I would engage if we were just having a personal conversation in your place of business.The triumphs of the people we honor here today it seems to me, are the triumphs of America.The idea that you've got a right to take a chance.You've got a right to fail so that you have the right to succeed.You're given the opportunity in a free-market economy to bring your ideas to bear and see if people respond.I have been terribly impressed&mdash;I've read the life histories of a lot of the award winners that are here today, and not just the three that we come to recognize.And I wish I could say something about all of you who are represented.But as you know, the purpose of this ceremony is to recognize the second runner-up, the first runner-up, and the Small Business Person of the Year.I just want to say to all the rest of you, we honor your achievements, and we know that these people, in a fundamental and profound sense, are reflective of what all of you have done.For David Parker, success has been what you might call an open-and-shut case.His Pelican Products of Torrance, California, began as a scuba supply manufacturer but now is best known as a maker of suitcases and containers that are so hardy they're used in the environmental safety industry.They've even survived on a trip to Mr.Everest, something I'm not sure I could do.Now, that is a real climb to success.I want to ask David to come up here and receive our congratulations as a second runner-tip in the Small Business Person of the Year.Carol Rae was hired as a consultant to the Magnum Diamond Corporation.But in no time, she was asked to run the company.Now, I can tell you, as somebody who has fooled with a lot of consultants, that in itself is an incredible compliment.As president of the business, she's made it a leader in surgical tools for eye surgery.The Rapid City, South Dakota company has grown from 7 employees to 68 in about 4 years.That's a very impressive achievement for Carol Rae, our first runner-up.Would you please come forward and be recognized? Did you hear what she said? 'I'm one of his customers.Kaytee is a case study of making change your friend and not your enemy.The business has been in his family since 1866 when it sold feed and grain, something I know a little about.Kaytee now sells only wild bird and pet food, and it's gone from 64 employees to 365 workers.Sales went up from $10.6 million to more than $70 million.And for his amazing accomplishments, Bill Engler, Jr., has been chosen the Small Business Person of the Year.Let's bring him up with a hand.I want to wish you continued success.I want to pledge you continued access to this administration.I want to ask you now as you leave here to give us the benefit of your ideas, your suggestions, your constructive criticisms and help us to bring to the White House the kind of entrepreneurial spirit that you have brought to your businesses and that we must all bring to the United States.Thank you very much.",clinton
"Thank you very much.It always seems to be a good thing for me when I'm introduced in New York by Governor Cuomo.And President Iselin made his eloquent remarks and then your fine Mayor spoke so forcefully, and the brilliant chairman of the Senate Finance Committee brought us back to Woodrow Wilson.And then Governor Cuomo once again gave me a hard act to follow, and they all left the stage.I thought to myself, pray this is not a metaphor for the battle ahead.This is the second thing I have had in common with President Wilson.I received a fascinating letter the other day from Johnston and Murphy, the shoe manufacturers from Nashville, Tennessee.They have made shoes for every President going back to the 1850's, so they made a pair of shoes for President Lincoln.And they send you a little catalog, and you pick the shoes you want, and they send them to you with your name in them.It says Johnston and Murphy-every President served.And so I ordered these rather simple plain black shoes, and they wrote me this wonderful letter in which they said, We're from Nashville, Tennessee, and we know what's in your heart.So here's an extra pair of shoes.And they sent me a box of blue suede shoes.And they said that in one way my choice was not particularly innovative, that five other Presidents had chosen the same style I did, including Harry Truman, which made me very proud.But they said, You do have the biggest feet of any President since Woodrow Wilson.President Wilson said in an address that Senator Moynihan quoted: I have been dealing with young men most of my life&mdash;he wasn't so gender-sensitive as he should have been-and one of the things I have tried most to impress upon them is not to stay young too long, but to take themselves seriously.Now at one level I want us all to stay young forever, but I do think the time has come for us to take ourselves and our purposes more seriously.This celebrated institution and the community of scholars and activists it embraces is the result, as President Iselin said, of Peter Cooper's determination more than 130 years ago to create an institution intellectually vigorous with free tuition, the first nondiscrimination policy in American history, and a genuine commitment to social justice.He believed you could do more than one thing at a time.Lincoln asked our country to confront the cost of the spread of slavery, to ask hard questions about the conditions that had plagued our Nation since its beginning.Remember it was Thomas Jefferson, not Abraham Lincoln&mdash;Thomas Jefferson the slave owner&mdash;who said, I tremble when I think of slavery to consider that God is just.There were people who knew in their hearts the truth but had denied it a long time.Lincoln said that to continue to do that threatened to tear our country apart.He knew the Nation would be destroyed if slavery spread and that unless the country's drifting stopped, the very drift would carry within it the seeds of our destruction.And so, here at Cooper Union he asked those hard questions and gave strong answers.Soon after, he won the nomination of the fledgling Republican Party and went on to win the Presidency by only 39 percent of the popular vote, receiving virtually no votes south of the Mason-Dixon line.Soon after that, the war came, and Lincoln's fight for the Union grew into a determination to abolish slavery.Several days a week I walk alone into the room in the White House where Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation and try to remember the purposes of the United States of America.The fight for the Union and the fight against slavery cost Abraham Lincoln his life, as well as the lives of hundreds of thousands of his fellow countrymen.But America prevailed in form and spirit.And America has endured in form and spirit because in times of crisis and challenge, leaders have asked the hard questions and given the strong answers.And the American people have rallied.Look at the condition of America today.How can we avoid asking those questions? To be sure, we are still the strongest Nation in the world politically, economically, and militarily.To be sure, more than anyone else in the world we have accommodated the incredible diversity of our land with remarkable harmony.When you look at what is happening, the heartbreak in the former Yugoslavia today, where there are three ethnic groups that genetically have no ethnic differences at all but call themselves ethnically different solely because of the accidents of religion and history, it is an incredible tribute that in this country, in this great city and across the country in Los Angeles and in all places in between, that we live together as well as we do with our diversity.But still we cannot avoid the hard questions.If we're so great, why are most middle class families working longer hours today than they were 20 years ago for wages that in real terms are less than they were a decade ago? Why are one in 10 of our people so impoverished they're on food stamps? Why are over 8 million of us out of work if we're in the 17th month of a recovery? Why are there over 35 million of us without health care and millions more Americans terrified of losing their health coverage, with 100,000 Americans a month losing their health insurance, and millions of others who can never change jobs under the current system because they or someone in their family has been sick and so they have a preexisting condition which makes them unemployable with health insurance elsewhere? Why? Why that half the people on welfare not get off of it as a safety net after just a few months? Why is there a whole class of new poor people, mostly young women and their little children, many of those children never born into an integrated family? Why? Why was&mdash;only 35 years ago, only 35 years ago&mdash;there conditions even in New York City in which there were three police officers on the street for every violent crime, and today there are three crimes for every police officer? Why does the Government fail to deal with the problems that this age has brought to us and engaged the American people in dealing with them? Why have we seen the Government's debt grow from $1 trillion to $4 trillion in the last 12 years, while we reduced our investment in the people of America and their promise and their ability to compete? Why in the world would we reduce all this defense spending, including jobs for engineers and scientists and factory workers, with no plan whatever to put that money back to work to create opportunities for them, cleaning up the environment or exploring the frontiers of technology here at home or helping us to compete with people all around the world? The American economy finds itself in the middle of a global marketplace, challenged on every hand by nations who have made wise investments in their people, their workers, and their technological edge.Yes, there is today a global recession which is making our problem more difficult.But if you take the long view, those who have made the investments in the eighties and those who are doing so now will be rewarded over the long run.For a decade or more, we have both expanded our debt and reduced our investment in areas key to our future.We also have in this country a crisis of belief and hope.When President Kennedy took office, younger than I was when I took office, over 70 percent of the American people fundamentally believed that their leaders would tell them the truth and that their system could succeed.Now it seems as if half the people just stand around waiting to be disappointed, waiting to be told what's wrong and who's failed and how the special interests once again have strangled the national interests and why they should go on about their business without believing things can be different.I believe that the nature of our challenge is this: We must both restore our economy and restore the confidence of our people in our democracy.And I do not believe we can do one without the other.This is a strange and, in a way, wondrous moment in our history when citizens everywhere desperately want things to change but still are wary of it and reluctant to place their faith in anyone's prescription.We must begin with the economy.We must change the way the Government works if we expect the economy to improve.And we must rebuild the confidence of the American people based on the three words which were the watch words of my campaign for President: more opportunity for all, more responsibility from all, and the clear understanding that we are a community and we're all in this together, going up or down together.Whether we like it or not, that is clearly the truth.And we must begin to act as if it were.How can we reduce the deficit? Let's start with the big problem of the debt.Well, the answer is not popular.To reduce the deficit you have to reverse what produced the deficit.What produced it? Tax cuts and spending increases.Doing what people like.The most popular thing in the world is for me to cut your tax and write you a check.And that was what was done by Government for the American people for 12 long years.I'll cut your tax and I'll write you a check&mdash;that's a good deal.It used to be known as a free lunch when I was a kid.We have to begin to reverse this process.And because Government has been at fault, first you should ask Government to change.So I have asked in Washington that we begin with significant spending cuts below the budget that was adopted last year to reduce the deficit and to free up resources for targeted investment in the future of our economy and of the young people here present in this hall.We should look at every program for possible savings, including ones that Democrats have favored for a long time.And there should be no tax increase, not a dollar, without the spending cuts.That is the meaning of the budget resolution that was passed a few weeks ago in record time.It contains the largest deficit reduction proposals in history, over $500 billion in deficit reduction over a 5-year period with more than 200 very specific cuts in programs.Those were tough to make, but necessary in the face of a $4 trillion debt that will continue to grow until the deficit itself is reduced to zero.That deficit is robbing us of our ability to invest in our future.More and more of our money just goes to pay interest on the debt.If we don't change it, by the end of the decade over 20 cents on every dollar you pay in taxes will go just to service the debt.Now, that is also a redistribution of wealth away from middle class taxpayers to the upper income people who hold the debt, instead of to invest in the jobs and the education and the infrastructure of the future of New York and the rest of America.We made cuts in Medicare, a thing that is difficult to do.We asked upper income Social Security recipients to pay tax on more of their incomes, a thing that is difficult to do.In spite of the fact that I value public service greatly and I believe public employees too often have been used as whipping boys for the difficulties and frustrations of the moment, still I asked the public employees of the United States of America to have a pay freeze for a year and to keep their wage increases below inflation and cost of living allowances for each of the next 3 years.I come from a rural State, heavily electrified by the Rural Electrification Agency, but I asked that the subsidies to the REA be reduced.I asked that certain programs that benefit cities but that don't have the accountability of the normal budgeting process also be reduced.All these were not easy.But it seems to me essential, if we're going to ask the American people to sacrifice, that the Government take the lead and show the way.We're also fighting, however, to do something no Government has done before, to both reduce the deficit and increase targeted investments in areas that are designed to secure the future of this country, in the ones Governor Cuomo mentioned: in Head Start; in the program to get children off to a healthier start in life with immunizations and nutrition; in better programs for apprenticeship training for our work force: in opening the doors of college education to all Americans through reforming the student loan process and a program of national service; in new incentives for our industries to develop new technology.These are things which other countries do as a matter of course and take for granted and which lead to huge increases in productivity.The case for them should be plain in America once inessential spending has been cut.The cuts, however, must be credible.And credibility is difficult to come by in Washington today.They must be legally enforceable.They must be plain to the American people.After 12 years of rising deficits and Americans feeling deceived about the issue, I don't blame the people of this country for being distrustful about what they hear from Washington when it comes to bringing down this deficit.That is why I have decided today to propose that we establish a deficit reduction trust fund and put every penny of new taxes and the budget cuts proposed in my budget into the trust fund so the American people know that it has to go to deficit reduction.There are several members of the New York congressional delegation here today.I thank them all for being here, and I thank especially Congressman Schumer for his leadership on this issue.I thank Senator Moynihan for his support of this issue.Senator Moynihan said on the way up here that he thought we ought to do it to win a victory for the clarity of our determination to reduce the deficit.Senator Bradley had an op-ed piece in the paper today endorsing the idea.The time has come to prove that when we say we're going to do something with the people's money, we actually do it.Let me repeat what this means.We will create a trust fund in which every dollar that is raised will go to deficit reduction and in which all the net budget cuts which have been approved will do so also.This is very important.This seriousness, however, should not relieve us of our obligation to recognize that over the long run we must also bring down the investment deficit in this country.I am as dedicated to that as I ever have been.I know that long-term economic growth depends on high-quality and comprehensive education and training, converting the workers and the investments from defense that is being cut to new technologies which must be increased, establishing new and innovative partnerships with the private sector and, as I said earlier, opening the doors of college education to all Americans.But bringing the deficit down will give us the freedom to do that.This budget saves, as I said, about $500 billion.And the trust fund will ensure that we do just that.It will be a change in the way Washington does business.It has broad support.But I also want to emphasize that it will only confirm the direction on which we have embarked.The financial markets here in New York have already understood the seriousness of this administration.Look what's happened to long-term interest rates just since the election, just since the election: mortgage rates at a 20-year low, many other interest rates at record lows.All the analysts say that if this can continue a few more months in this period, we will see about $100 billion freed up for investment in America through people refinancing their home loans and business loans and taking out car loans and consumer loans at lower interest rates.This is a job stimulus program that is big and important.And bringing the deficit down so that the huge overhang of private and public debt of the 1980's can be refinanced is a great strategy to begin the economic renewal of America, and we must stick with it.More can be done.But to do more we have to actually rethink the whole way the Federal Government operates: How does it operate on its own terms? How does it relate to the States and the private sector? I asked the Congress to give me some more money for technology so I could run the White House with many fewer people than my predecessors had.I asked that we have a 14-percent across-the-board cut in the administrative costs of the Federal Government over the next few years: 100,000 reduction in the payroll by attrition, over $9 billion in savings simply by administrative changes alone.But that is just the beginning.I have also asked Vice President Gore to head a task force which will reexamine every agency of the Federal Government, every program of the Federal Government, and the whole way it is organized.Every major company in America had to go through a wrenching reexamination process in the 1980's.The Federal Government had many of its Departments cut, but the way it operated continued to be largely unexamined.It is time that we impose the same sort of reexamination process on the National Government.When we do it, we will find more savings, and more importantly, we will increase the quality of service to the American people.Finally, I want to compliment the House of Representatives last week on passing a bill with the mind-boggling title of enhanced rescission.But when you strip it away, what it amounts to is a modified line-item veto, which is enjoyed by most Governors and which will enable the President to strike out spending items that he believes are unnecessary but will give the Congress the freedom to put them back in after voting on them individually so, that the people can make their own judgment and so can the Members of Congress.These things will make the Federal Government more efficient and will set us on the path to long-term reform.We ought to also think about our partnership with the private sector and our partnership with State and local government.Mayor Dinkins mentioned it.I was gratified to see a couple of mentions in the press recently about the fact that our administration had tried to give cities more relief from unnecessary regulations and States more leeway in promoting various kinds of reform in health care.I just told Governor Cuomo that I was very excited about the health care reform package that he put forward in New York, and Hillary's task force has been very much influenced by the New York reforms.We believe that a lot of the problems of America can be solved by cities and States if the National Government will have targeted investment and then will give people their head to do what they know needs to be done.You'd be amazed how many programs have quite a bit of money in them, but most of the money, or a great deal of the money, never reaches the ultimate beneficiaries at the State or the city level because of all the layers in between.You'd be amazed.I was in Chicago a couple of days ago, and the Mayor of Chicago told me that there are one or two programs that his staff wouldn't even let him try to get for Chicago because the administrative hassle of securing the funds was so great.We're going to change that.We're going to have a new and different and vibrant process that trusts the people of New York and their elected leaders, and the State of New York and their elected leaders, and people throughout the country to have real innovation in the same way that I think we want in the private sector in the United States.We also have proposed to change the relationship between the Government and the private sector in a tax reform package that Senator Moynihan will soon take up if it passes the House, and I hope it does.There will be significant incentives for businesses, large and small, to increase their investment in this country and to be rewarded for it.We will have initiatives that will empower neighborhoods and give people significant incentives to go into neighborhoods in small towns and rural areas and in big cities to put real investment there to create real jobs.We'll provide people real incentives to end welfare as we know it and require them to move forward with that.We will do things that are different from what either party has done before to try to empower people to live up to their God-given potential in a new and different partnership between the United States and people in the private sector.When you strip it all away, there's still one more tough question that has to be answered.If you want the deficit brought down, we have to face the fact that in 1981, taxes were cut by 6 percent of the national income of this country, twice what President Reagan originally recommended when he was elected President.And that gap has never been made up.David Stockman, President Reagan's Budget Director, has an interview in a magazine called the New Politics Quarterly this month in which he says, I don't agree with all of President Clinton's spending plan, but at least he's telling the truth.You cannot fix the deficit without a tax program, because we cut taxes more than twice as much as we proposed to do it when we came in.We got into a bidding war.We got carried away.What we did was irresponsible.And then all the politicians since then never had the stomach to tell the American people the truth.And it was just more fun to cut taxes and pass out money than to do the reverse.Now, that is the hard truth.I really believed in the campaign that we could raise revenues modestly on upper income people, close some corporate tax loopholes, and do some other things, do the spending cuts, and bring the deficit down.After I was elected, the Government announced that the annual deficit was going to be $50 billion a year bigger in 3 of the 4 years that I would serve as President, $50 billion a year bigger, and $15 billion bigger in the fourth year.And it became clear to me that under those circumstances we could not begin by cutting anyone's taxes; that we ought to have a responsible, balanced energy tax and that most of the tax burden should be borne by those who had their taxes lowered in the eighties while their incomes went up, people in higher income groups; but that we ought to have a balanced and fair package, not to soak the rich but to share the burden, to try to say this is our job.And so I say to you, yes, I will put this money in a trust fund, but that does not mean the money does not have to be paid.If you want the interest rates to stay down, if you want the profits of lower interest rates, you must undergo the pain of the spending cuts and the tax increases, because that's the only way to really bring the deficit down.Now, the question is, are we going to do this, or not? Are we going to do this, or not?Audience members.Yes, we are.I think we are.There are some who say no.Today in Washington there are 80,000 lobbyists.It's a growth industry.I'll guarantee you one thing, I created some jobs since I got to be President.But the Congress is now dealing with two bills which will help to reform the way our politics work.They just passed the motor voter bill, something young people of America really wanted and which I'm very proud of, which I hope and pray will continue the trend of increased voter participation.But now Congress is dealing with two tough other issues.The United States Senate passed last week a bill&mdash;finally, believe it or not, in the year 1993&mdash;finally requiring everybody who actually lobbies them to register as a lobbyist and requiring that the gifts that they give to Members of Congress or the expenditures they make on trips or whatever all be reported.Believe it or not, they weren't done before now.The Congress passed that with only two dissenting votes&mdash;the Senate did.The bill is now going to the House.In addition to that, last Friday I proposed a comprehensive campaign finance reform law which will lower the cost of congressional campaigns, reduce the influence of political action committees, and open the airwaves to challengers as well as incumbents for more honest debate.It is a tough, good bill.If we can pass these bills, they will help to open the system too.People are full of hope now.We've received in 3 1/2 months more letters than the White House got in all of 1992.If you haven't gotten yours answered, I hope you'll be patient.We've got over 200 volunteers coming in just to open the mail and trying to sort it and read it.But it is a wonderful reaffirmation, the critical and the complimentary and support letters alike, that Americans really want their system to respond to them again.And we must do that.If the first issue is the economy&mdash;or in the vernacular of my old campaign sign, It's the economy, stupid&mdash;that means deficit reduction, investment for jobs and technology, and education.It means controlling health care costs and dealing with that crisis.I should tell you that no matter how much we reduce the deficit in the next 5 years, it will go fight back up again if we don't address health care costs, because that's the fastest growing part of the Federal budget deficit.It must include all these things, as well as political reform and changing the way Government works.And change is hard.It doesn't happen overnight.You have to do what Lincoln did: Ask hard questions, give strong answers, and hope the American people rally.We can move forward.We can have a whole new partnership in this country, one that goes beyond the things that normally divide us, beyond the dividing lines of party, of race, of gender, of region, of income.We can do that.Ideas and energy can replace drift and delay.We can grow in wealth and wisdom and liberty.But this requires more than good ideas and more than political energy.If I may say, if you don't remember anything else I say, I hope you'll remember this: The human condition in the end changes by faith.And faith cannot be held in your hand.The Scripture that I carry to my place of worship every Sunday says, Faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things unseen.But make no mistake about it, it is by far the most powerful force that can ever be mustered in the cause of change.Today we are seeing too much cynicism and too little faith, an obsession with the moment, an obsession with the politicians and their wins and their losses, an obsession with blame and division, an obsession with paralysis, an obsession with always pointing out the pain of change and never embracing its promise.Without faith, in the end we always wind up resorting to the easy and the immediate: Tax the other guy; cut that other program, not mine; wait for somebody to deliver the goods to me, or wait for it not to happen till I can blame somebody else for what didn't.But faith changes all that.Lincoln's cause in 1860 was to keep our house from dividing.Our cause today is to put our house in order.If a house divided against itself cannot stand, surely a house in disarray will not provide shelter and a home.Surely a house where problems are denied or blamed on someone else in the next room can never be a home for America.To preserve the American dream in our time and for your future, yes, our leaders must ask tough questions and give strong answers.But people must rally to the cause of change with faith.We have to believe again, believe through the frustrations and the difficulties of the moment, as Martin Luther King characterized them, believe through the inevitable rocks in the road to the ends of the journey.We must believe through the smallness and the spite that conflict always brings out in all of us.We must believe through that, to the spirit and generosity and courage that is America at its essence.Mr.Lincoln closed his Cooper Union speech with the following words: Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith, let us to the end dare to do our duty as we understand it.My fellow Americans, our clear duty is to revive the American dream and restore the American economy.And for as long as it takes, with energy and joy and humility, let us dare to do that duty.Thank you very much.",clinton
"Thank you very much.To Bruce and to Lew, and to all of you, I've had a wonderful time tonight.These lights are so bright.I only know half the people I've shaken hands with.It has been a wonderful time.I want to thank all the people who made this dinner possible, and I want to thank the wonderful entertainment.The choir was terrific.The group doing all the wonderful old songs from Dionne Warwick in the sixties were magnificent.I was delighted to see Barry Manilow again in such wonderful voice, and grateful for his many contributions to our common efforts.I appreciated Phil Hartman saying he voted for me, but it's not quite enough for all the abuse I've put up with in advance.Thank you, Roy Furman.Thank you, David Wilhelm.A lot of you were here with me a long time ago.I remember once, more than a year ago, when I came to New York and there were hundreds of people here in a hotel for a fund-raiser for me.I was dropping like a rock in New Hampshire.All those experts said I was dead.I hear their call again.And I just couldn't believe all these folks were even showing up for a dinner in New York.It was so dark in the campaign, I thought, well, people will go ahead and send their checks and then stay home.I imagined going into this vast ballroom and making a speech to eight people.And I was feeling pretty sorry for myself, frankly.And I told this story many times, but a man stopped me in the hall who was working at the hotel and said that he was a Greek immigrant and he was going to vote for me because his son asked him to&mdash;was only 10 years old-that if I got elected, he wanted me to do something for his son.He said, Where I come from, we were poor but we were free.Here, I make more money, but my boy's not free.He can't go across the street and play in the park without accompaniment from me.He can't even go to his school safely without my going with him.And I want you to work to help make my boy free.And it made me remember what politics was all about.I don't even remember what I said that night, but I know all of a sudden I had forgotten about me and started thinking about the rest of America.And I think that is what we ought to think about tonight.When we talk about a program, it only counts if there are people behind it.New York City, for all of the problems you may think you have, has registered the first decline in the crime rate in 36 years, because you did something about community policing.So we know now that there is a strategy which can make people freer.That's what personal safety is.And there is no excuse for not doing something about it.And that's what politics is about: focusing on the dreams and hopes and fears and needs of people.Sometimes I think that when we have these wonderful dinners, which are delightful to me, I've gotten to see some of you that I haven't even seen since the election, just to say a simple thank you to you.Remember, we all did it so that we can make a difference in people's lives.I want to say a special word of tribute here with all the people from New York and New Jersey and Connecticut, and my friend Mayor Rendell and others here from Pennsylvania, and there's even a handful of folks here from my home State.They were the ones who were clapping when Lew Katz gave his Arkansas pander, which I appreciate.I want to say a special word about one person who is here.I want to congratulate my friend Jim Florio on winning the John F.Kennedy Profiles in Courage Award, for facing the financial problems of his State, for facing the educational problems of his State and, yes, for being willing to stand up for the police officers and the people of his cities and State who wanted to be safe from crime, standing up to the gun lobby, and being for safe streets.That's why he got the award, doing real things, even if they weren't so hot in the polls at the time.Now our country is being called upon together to try to do the things that we just talked about in the campaign.Governor Mario Cuomo said again today when he introduced me at the Cooper Union that we campaign in poetry, but we must govern in prose.It's another way of saying, and a more eloquent way of saying, it's a lot easier to talk about change than it is to do it.I was overwhelmed today to have the opportunity to speak on the same spot where Abraham Lincoln spoke at the Cooper Union in 1860.And I went back and read large portions of Mr.Lincoln's speech.He came to the Cooper Union and catapulted himself into the nomination of the Republican Party, into the Presidency, and into the history and hearts of America.He did it by saying this is a difficult time, we have to ask hard questions and give strong answers.He said that we could not allow slavery to continue to expand; and that if we did, it would destroy the United States.He said in many other places that if the house is divided against itself, it could not stand.Lincoln went on to become President, and he expanded his vision, and he eventually signed the Emancipation Proclamation abolishing slavery.In the White House we have a painting called Waiting for the Hour, of black slaves watching a clock at 5 minutes to 12, waiting for the stroke of midnight, January 1st, 1863, for the Emancipation Proclamation to become effective.Several times a week, often late at night, I go alone into the room where Lincoln signed that proclamation, and I remembered what the Presidency is really for: to help the American people move forward.It is for us now to put this house in order.And the beginning is to stop denying our problems and to accept some common responsibility for solving them.The first thing we have to do is to prove that the Government can be trusted with your money by passing a budget that will bring the deficit down.Look what has happened.Look what has happened just since the election, because finally the country has an administration trying to do that: long-term interest rates going down very low, 20-year low; billions of dollars, tens of billions being recycled into this economy, giving people the opportunity to make new starts.We have got to do that.We also have to deal with this health care crisis.You know, so many of you said nice things about Hillary tonight, and I want to say I appreciate it, because about every third day she stops speaking to me because I asked her to run the health care project.But it is also perhaps the most urgent.If we cannot give working families the security of knowing they're not going to lose their health care, if we can't give businesses the security of knowing that health care doesn't have to go up at 2 or 3 times the rate of inflation, if we can't provide coverage to the 35 million Americans which don't have it, if we can't face the crises of AIDS and the lack of health care in rural areas and big cities, and if we can't invest in research in those things that we have not come to grips with in health care, what can we do as a country? Every other nation has done a better job of many of these things than we do, and so we must.They say, well, you should only do one thing at a time.You can't walk and chew gum at the same time in Washington, that's what they say.But I say we will do one thing at a time, but we have to honestly put it all out there.If you want to bring the deficit down, you have to do health care.The only purpose of bringing the deficit down is to make the economy healthy.You have to invest in new technologies and give people incentives to create opportunity for others.It is not so simple as to say, well, just think about this and let another idea cross your mind a year or two from now.We have got to be about the business of rebuilding America.And we can do that if we keep our eyes on the whole picture: bring the debt down, invest in our future, deal with the health care crisis, deal with the special problems of special people in special areas that have been left out and left behind.I believe we can do these things.I also have to tell you here at this magnificent fund-raiser tonight that I am so humbled that so many of you have helped me for so long and asked for nothing in return, and others have done it in spite of the fact that many of the changes that I have advocated are not in your personal, immediate, short-term interest.You ought to be proud of that, because I'm proud of you.One of the problems that has just killed this country is that all of us have had our blinders on and we've been able to see about 6 inches in front of our eyes.And all of Washington for too long has been dominated by that: 80,000 lobbyists, because of the absence of a compelling national public vision, each picking apart the public interest.Now I think we have to follow through also on our commitment to political reform, to campaign finance reform, to lower the cost of campaigns, reduce the influence of PAC's, and open the airwaves to challengers.It'll also be nicer for you if you could only go to one dinner a year instead of four or five.It's a good thing.We should do it.I also believe that we have to continue on this whole reform track.We passed a modified line-item veto in the House of Representatives.The Senate ought to pass it and let the President take the heat for controlling unnecessary spending.We ought to continue to work to open up the political process.Hallelujah, the gridlock was broken yesterday, and the United States Congress passed the motor voter bill to open up the political process to young people all across the country.These are things that can make a difference.We have to begin to think about America in terms of what's in it for all of us together so that we can move forward together.Let me just mention one or two things tonight.A couple of days ago I was in Cleveland, and on the way out of town, I went by a little pierogi place started by a wonderful young woman who wanted to start her own restaurant, couldn't get a bank loan.She came from a big Polish family, so she just took the Cleveland phone book and called hundreds of people with Polish surnames and asked them to invest in her business until she got 80 folks who'd give her $3,000 apiece, and she's doing real well now.They're the kind of people that we ought to be fighting for.When I got to another one of my meetings, I saw a woman who had six children and was supporting these children all by herself, making a handsome salary that she had to give up because one of her children was so desperately ill the only way she could afford the child's health care was to become eligible for Government assistance, because we don't have a health care system.And she was there in my speech with her beloved child and their $100,000-amonth medical bills.They're the people who are worth fighting for.I received a letter yesterday from a wonderful young man and his wife who became friends of mine in New Hampshire and had a desperately ill child who had troubles at birth.And he lost his health insurance and he had to choose between working and not working to get on public assistance, and he struggled on.And the letter says that he just had to file for bankruptcy, but he hasn't given up on himself or his family or his country, and he wants me to keep fighting to make the economy better.That's what this whole effort is all about.There are real people and lives and dramas worthy of the greatest admiration behind so many stories in this room, so many stories in this country.I ask you for your continued support.I ask you to support the suggestion I made today that we're going to put all this money we're trying to raise into a deficit-reduction trust and say to the American people, every dollar of the tax will go to reduce the debt, and none of the taxes will be raised without the spending cuts.Tell the Congress that we ought to do it, instead of just fooling around with it and talking about it.But I ask you, finally, to remember that the atmosphere in which we labor, you and I, is still heavily laden with cynicism and skepticism.People have been disappointed on and off for 20 years.I was looking the other night at a little bit of history, an account of the Kennedy administration, reminding me that when President Kennedy was elected, the same sort of time, the same sort of moment, except that over 70 percent of the American people, when he went in, believed that leaders told the truth to the American people and believed they could trust their leaders to do the right thing.We don't have that today.One of the things that those of you who had some personal contact and personal involvement in this administration can do is to help to restore the sense of faith that the American people used to take for granted.We simply can never succeed, ever, if every step along the way is burdened with people who are denying their own responsibility, waiting for someone to deliver them while making no effort, waiting for someone else to blame, letting the spite that comes out of every conflict overcome the larger vision and purposes that we are about.I am telling you, if we could do one thing tonight that would guarantee the success of everything else we're going to do, it would be all of us in our own way to walk out of here and say, let's try to put aside all of our differences and think about how we can lift up the people of this country.Let us, for a few months, suspend all of our cynicism and instead put our faith in the process that took us to the polls last November.Let us try to bring out the best in one another even in the most heated debates in the Congress.I worry from time to time only about one thing, and that is that the people who have to make these decisions will not feel the energy of the American people desperately saying, Change, have the courage to change.Challenge me, bring out the best in me.Do not give in to the pressures and the temptations of the moment but go forward to a better life.I ask all of you, too, to remember that I'm going to get up every day and go to work and work hard.Some days I work smarter than other days, but every day I'll work hard.I ask you to remember that one of the great challenges of being President is to try to devote enough time and attention to the job to get the job done and save enough time to stay among the people, selling what you've done and listening and making the proper adjustment when there is something more you need to learn.I asked so many of you back during the election not to take the election as the end but the beginning of this enterprise.And so I invite you again to be a part of this great enterprise, with your ideas as well as your spirit.We've got 4 years of work to do.We can move this country forward in great ways and in profound ways that will benefit millions, indeed all, of the people of this country.But it's going to take every last good idea, and every last ounce of will and vision, and every ounce of courage and faith.You have to be a part of that.I want you to leave here tonight knowing that I still want that just as badly as I did in the election.I did not run for this job to move into The White House, as great an honor as that is.I did not run for this job even to have the enormous privilege of standing on Harry Truman's balcony and looking at the statue of Thomas Jefferson every night.I ran for it to be faithful to the tradition they established by making your life better, and you have to help me do that.Thank you and God bless you all.",clinton
"Thank you very much.Thank you very much, Governor Romer, ladies and gentlemen.I felt pretty good sitting at that table although that's my real place over there.And then we also got to discuss the deficit crisis and the budget problems a little bit.I wanted to come here today, as you prepare to leave, to once again reaffirm my commitment to working in partnership with the Governors.You deal with real people in a more immediate way than, unfortunately, the President often gets to do.When I was a Governor, every day I would hear directly from people or see people who had suffered from layoffs or had their businesses closed down or who were afraid of losing their health coverage or who desperately wanted to improve their schools.As you and I learned from last year's elections, the only pattern was not a partisan one.It was a pattern of determination on the part of the American people to have their political system and their Government address their real concerns.They don't want our process divided by partisanship or dominated by special interest or driven by short-term advantage.They know things that have too often been forgotten here over the last dozen years.The values that are central to our country's character must be central to our Government: work, family, faith, opportunity, responsibility, and community.What I appreciated about this meeting is that no matter what our region or our party, we've always gotten together and tried to pay serious attention to our problems.I think the Governors have exemplified for the last dozen years the bold, persistent experimentation that President Roosevelt called for at the beginning of the Great Depression when he took office.And I'm here to tell you that I'm going to do everything I can to work with you in partnership to share ideas and resources and energy to try to do what we can to move this country forward.As we discussed health care, economic policy, and the deficit yesterday, I'd like to spend just a few moments today talking about something that many of us have been working on since the middle 1980's, the issue of welfare reform.I've often spoken with many of you about the need to end welfare as we know it, to make it a program that supports people who have fallen on hard times or who have difficulties that can be overcome, but eventually and ultimately a program that helps people to get on their feet through health care, child care, job training, and ultimately a productive job.The taxpayers, the social service employees themselves don't think much of it either.Most people on welfare are yearning for another alternative, aching for the chance to move from dependence to dignity.And we owe it to them to give them that chance.With the support of people in the House and the Senate, with the particular help of Senator Moynihan, now the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and with the support of The White House, the Governors had an unprecedented role in writing the Family Support Act of 1988, which President Reagan signed into law shortly before he left office and which Senator Moynihan said was the most significant piece of social reform in this area in the last generation.The Family Support Act embodies a principle which I believe is the basis of an emerging consensus among people without regard to party or without regard to their traditional political philosophies.We must provide people on welfare with more opportunities for job training, with the assurance that they will receive the health care and child care they need when they go to work, and with all the opportunities they need to become self-sufficient.But then we have to ask them to make the most of these opportunities and to take a job.As all of you know, the States never had the chance to fully implement the Welfare Reform Act of 1988 for two reasons: first, because over the last 4 years the welfare rolls have exploded everywhere and health care costs have gone up as the job market has declined and the economy has grown at the slowest rate in half a century; secondly, because of the economic problems, Government revenues have been down and the Congress and the administration were never able to fully fund the education and training portion of the act.This was clearly manifested not only in the growth of welfare rolls but in the fact that last year, for the first time since the program began, 1 in 10 Americans were on food stamps.So as the weak economy left millions of more in poverty, and the welfare rolls increased 5 times greater during the last 4 years than under the previous two administrations combined, it made it more difficult to make welfare reform work.In spite of that, I think it would be a great mistake to conclude that that act was of no significance or that nothing good has occurred.Bipartisan efforts in State after State from New Jersey to Georgia, to Wisconsin, and many others all across the country, have resulted in innovative approaches to help move people off welfare rolls and onto payrolls.In our State, through the program we call Project Success, more than 17,000 people moved from welfare to work.And more importantly, at a time when the rolls were exploding, our rolls grew much more slowly than the national average.Many of you have your own successes to report, and I had the opportunity to visit, in many of the States here represented, projects that were terribly impressive to me.I say this to make the following point: The bill that is on the books will work, given the right economy and the right kind of support systems, but we need to do more than fully implement it; we need to do that and go beyond.I salute you for forming a State officials advisory group on welfare reform with Governors and legislators and health and welfare directors from 10 States.I want to tell you today that within the next 10 days I will announce a welfare reform group to work with you.I will ask top officials from The White House, the Health and Human Services, and other agencies involved to sit down with Governors and congressional leaders and develop a welfare reform plan that will work.I have asked the best people in the Nation on this subject to come and help me do this.The day I took office I promised the American people I would fight for more opportunity for all and demand more responsibility from all.And that is a commitment I am determined to keep, with your help, by putting an end to welfare as we know it.Our working group will learn from and work with State officials, business and labor folks, and leaders from every walk of life who care about this issue.On welfare reform, as on health care reform, there are no top-down, made-in-Washington solutions that will work for everyone.The problems and the progress are to be found in the communities of this country.But I do want to tell you the principles this morning that will guide my administration as we work with you to reform welfare.First, welfare should be a second chance, not a way of life.I want to give people on welfare the education and training and the opportunities they need to become self-sufficient.To make sure they can do it after they go to work, they must still have access to health care and to child care.So many people stay on welfare not because of the checks; the benefit levels, as many of you know, in real dollar terms are lower than they were 20 years ago.They do it solely because they do not want to put their children at risk of losing health care or because they do not have the money to pay for child care out of the meager wages they can earn coming from a low education base.We have got to deal with that.I believe 2 years after a training program is completed, you have to ask people to take a job ultimately, either in the private sector or in public service.There must be, in addition to the full implementation of the welfare reform act of 1988, in my opinion, a time-certain beyond which people don't draw a check for doing nothing when they can do something.And there is a lot of work out there to be done.Senator Boren and Senator Wofford have offered a bill to try to recreate on a very limited basis a pilot project that would take the best of what was done with the work programs of the thirties and try to throw them into the context of the nineties.We must begin now to plan for a time when people will ultimately be able to work for the check they get, whether the check comes from a private employer or from the United States taxpayers.Today, about half the people on welfare are just the people welfare was meant to help.They fall on hard times, and they have to have public assistance.They're eager to move on with their lives.And after 5 or 6 months or 8 months they're right back at work again, struggling to make their way in the American way.About half the people on welfare stay on for over 2 years.But one in four persons, the people that we really need to try to help to break the cycle that is gripping their children and grandchildren, about one in four stays a recipient for 8 years or longer.Those are the folks that Governor Wilder I know is now working on, that many of you have tried to address the problems of, and I want to help you with that.Second, we need to make work pay.We have to make sure that every American who works full-time, with a child in the home, does not live in poverty.If there is dignity in all work, there must be dignity for every worker.Therefore, I will propose an expansion in the earned-income tax credit which supplements the income of the working poor.We can do that.We ought to be able to lift people who work 40 hours a week, with kids in their home, out of poverty.And we will remove the incentive for staying in poverty.It will be much less expensive than to have Government direct supplements to pay people to remain idle.And it will reinforce the work ethic.If we can do that and at the same time do what we discussed yesterday, control health care costs and expand coverage so that no one has to stay on welfare just to take care of their children's medical needs, I think you will see a dramatic breakthrough in our efforts to liberate people from their dependency.Third, we need tougher child support enforcement.An estimated 15 million children have parents who could pay child support but don't.We need to make sure that they do.Parents owe billions of dollars in child support that is unpaid, money that could go a long way toward cutting the welfare rolls and lifting single parents out of poverty and money that could go a long way toward helping us control Government expenditures and reducing that debt.We're going to toughen child support enforcement by creating a national databank to track down deadbeat parents, by having the States go as far as they possibly can to establish paternity at the hospital when children are born, and if I can prevail up here, by using the IRS to collect unpaid support in seriously delinquent cases.I've said it before because it's the simple truth: Governments don't raise children, people do.And even people who aren't around ought to do their part to raise the children they bring into this world.Fourth, we need to encourage experimentation in the States.I will say again what you know so well: There are many promising initiatives right now at the State and local level, and we will work with you to encourage that kind of experimentation.I do not want the Federal Government, in pushing welfare reforms based on these general principles, to rob you of the ability to do more, to do different things.And I want to try to flesh out a little bit of the idea we discussed yesterday about the waivers.My view is that we ought to give you more elbow room to experiment.I know I was perplexed during the recent campaign when I tried to make a statement that some people in the press said reflected waffling, and it seemed to me to express the real genius of the federal system.I said that if I were President I would approve waivers of experiments that I did not necessarily agree with.And they said, You're trying to have it both ways.I said, No, I'm not.I'm trying to honor the Founding Fathers.If we didn't disagree on anything, what would be the need for experiments? That is the nature of the experiment, is that one person has an idea different from another person.So I will encourage all of us to work together to try things that are different.And the only thing I want to ask you in return is, let us measure these experiments and let us measure them honestly, so that if they work, we can make them the rule, we can all adopt things that work.And if they don't, we can stop and try something else.That's the only thing I ask of you.If we say, okay, we're going to have more waivers and you're going to be able to experiment in projects that use Federal dollars, let's measure the experiment, let's be honest about it.And if it works, let's tell everybody it works so we can all do it.And if it doesn't, let's have the courage to quit and admit it didn't.I think all of us want what most people on welfare want, a country that gives you a hand up, not a handout.We don't have a person to waste.We need the talent, the energy, the skills of every man and woman, every boy and girl in this country.Of all the problems we have with competitiveness, whether it is the deficit or the level of investment or anything else, I think all of us know in our heart of hearts America's biggest problem today is that too many of our people never get a shot at the American dream and that if all of our people were living up to the fullest of their potential, we would surely have a much easier path in solving all the issues that we constantly debate about at these meetings.Of all my moments as Governor, one I remember with the most pride occurred here at a National Governors' Association meeting during that 2-year period when we were working on welfare reform.Governor Castle and I sponsored a panel, and I think 40 Governors attended.And we had welfare recipients from all over the country come in and talk to the Governors about what it was like to be on welfare.A woman from Arkansas who was there, whom I knew but had not vetted for this conversation, started talking about her program and how she'd gone into a training program and she had gotten a job, all of that.And I did something lawyers are told never to do: I asked a question without knowing the answer.I said, Do you think this program ought to be mandatory? Should everybody have to participate in this? She said, I sure do.And I said, Why? And she said, Well, because if it wasn't, there would be a lot of people like me home watching the soaps because we don't believe we can make anything of ourselves anymore.So you've got to make it mandatory.And I said, What's the best thing about having a job? She said, When my boy goes to school, and they say, 'What does your mama do for a living?', he can give an answer.I think that moment says more than I will ever be able to say about why this is important, not just important for the poor but important for the rest of us.We must end poverty for Americans who want to work.And we must do it on terms that dignify all of the rest of us, as well as help our country to work better.I need your help, and I think we can do it.Thank you very much.",clinton
"Thank you very much, Mr.Vice President.Mr.Panetta, Ms.Rivlin, ladies and gentlemen.I'm really sorry to know that the Vice President has a lavish office in this building.If it gets any hotter over at the White House he may want to occupy it.Nobody in this country is working any harder than you are to give the promises I made to the American people a chance to take life.And I just wanted to come by here today and say a simple thank you.For years politicians have run for President and Governor and other offices by running against the Government.And to be sure, there is a lot to run against; there is a lot which needs to be changed.There are people here in this room today that know more specifically about what needs to be changed than those of us who give speeches about it.But I think it is terribly important, in the midst of all that rhetoric, not to forget that behind that Government that needs to be changed there are people who have decided to give their lives to the interest of the United States and its citizens.And they deserve to be honored.And I do appreciate that.I wanted to tell you today a little bit about why I think I got elected to this job and what I hope, together, we can do, and most importantly, what's behind the enormous and increasingly complex challenges facing this country.Let me begin by relating a simple experience I had a few months ago which affected me deeply, involving a man named Benjamin Edwards, a 52-year-old man who lived in Philadelphia.The night of the first Presidential debate, he had a viewing party at his house, but it was a highly unusual viewing party.He was out of work, and his electricity had been turned off because he couldn't pay the bills.So his neighbors brought over television sets and lamps and ran extension cords from a nearby apartment because that's the only way they could watch it.About 100 of them did.And the next day Benjamin Edwards took a bus 15 miles to attend one of our campaign rallies.As I came down the line, he grabbed my hand and told me to win the election because he had to have a job.I told him that if I won the election I'd try to get him a job.Well, he's got a job now because he became somewhat famous as a result of this incident.I read an article yesterday in the paper about another unemployed person who had voted for me who had only gotten a form response from the White House.And I told somebody today to pick up the phone and call him and talk to him and try to make him feel connected to his Government again.I say this to reiterate something that I think most of you already know, but it's easy to forget here working in the splendid isolation of the Capital City.Budgets are not about numbers; they're about people.They mean jobs and health care, education or training.We can't ever afford to let our people get lost in a blizzard of statistics.Since the election we've learned even more about the difficulty of the budgets and the difficulty of putting together an economic program that puts people to work in the short run and deals with the long-term problems of this economy.Just today we got the news about the economic indicators for the month of December being the best in 10 years and yet the disturbing prospect that a lot of new jobs are not being created.How could this be so? Well, partly because there's been no inflation in the economy and interest rates have been down for some while; people are now beginning to refinance their home, debts, or buy and sell new homes, so that generates a lot of economic activity.And partly because we have an inordinate number of companies in our free enterprise system who have gotten more and more productive and therefore earning more money.The problem is that a lot of them are doing what we need to do, which is to gradually downsize.A lot of them are not hiring new people, even though their incomes are going way up.Now, during the eighties that happened to the Fortune 500 companies, which reduced employment by over a couple hundred thousand a year all during the eighties.But all those jobs were made up for in the eighties by small businesses hiring new people.And yet, now small business hiring is dropping, too, as small businesses are loathe to hire new people because they can't afford to pay for health care or because they can't get credit from their local banks.So we have this anomalous situation where the economy seems to be growing but employment is not, and where more and more middle-income workers are working harder and harder every year but their wages aren't keeping up with inflation, and the costs of health care and education are outstripping inflation.So we have this perplexing dilemma.How can we build on what the free enterprise system is doing that is good, get small business growth going again, and increase investment so that we generate more high-wage jobs, so that the economy can grow, not just in the overall statistics but in the real lives of real people? That's important to you, not only because of your mission at OMB but because how you do is a reflection of how the taxpayers do, since they pay your bill.So you have an immediate as well as a long-range interest in the success of what is our economic commitment: to do something which the American people have never before had to do, to increase investment and bring down the deficit at the same time.That is our challenge.And on February 17 we're going to start anew in an effort to meet that challenge.We've got to turn this country around to build a long-term stable growth of jobs and income.We cannot go 10 more years with insufficient jobs and insufficient income growth for people who are working hard, playing by the rules, willing to become educated and trained in ever-new skills, meeting ever-new challenges.That is our challenge.And we are doing our best to meet it.Since no one has ever tried to do both these things at once, to get the job base going, which we want to do with a modest stimulus program in the beginning, increase permanently investment in people and jobs and growth, and reduce the deficit, it is not always clear exactly what specific decisions we must make.But the general path we have to follow is clear, because if we don't do something about investment, we won't have the kind of high-wage jobs that will shape a good future for ourselves and our children.If we don't do something about the deficit, it will eventually overwhelm our ability to borrow money at affordable rates and to have any money left in the public purse to take care of people in need and to invest in our future.So we have no choice but to embark on this course, but it is an uncharted course.No one has ever tried to do both things at the same time before.President Roosevelt elected to pursue investments in putting the American people back to work; deflation was so bad he didn't have to worry about the deficit.And before he had to deal with it, we were in a world war with full production and a massive deficit that then dropped dramatically as a percentage of our income for the next 35 years for the simple reason that we were growing so fast we didn't have to worry about it.Now we need a new commitment to investment, but we cannot ignore our debt.We have to remember a few basic things, I think, in putting this program together.The first is that while every American is willing to make a contribution, the contribution we ask of every American must be viewed against what happened to them in the 1980's.In the 1980's, the middle class paid the bill while the wealthiest Americans enjoyed the fruits of their labors.Taxes went up on middle class Americans while their real incomes went down.Taxes went down on upper income Americans while their real incomes went up.The expansion of Government services, the expansion of all the public programs was basically done on the backs of the people who weren't having any income growth.That means before we ask them to do more, we have to demand that Government do everything it can to do with less.Before I ask working Americans to work harder and pay more, I will ask the economic elite, who made more money and paid less in taxes, to pay their fair share.We have to literally be about the business, as Vice President Gore said first, of reinventing Government.I have been very careful, I will say again, to honor the contribution of public employees.I know that to a major degree, I cannot succeed as President unless you and the people who work in all these other departments believe in our common mission.I know that for every subject I could bring up that I want do do something about, there are 10 employees in this city of the Federal Government who know more about the details of what ought to be done than I do.I need your ideas and your energy.When I say we're going to reinvent Government, we're going to downsize some things; we're going to stop doing other things.We're going to do it in a way that lifts up the influence, the energy, and values the ideas of our best employees, not that grinds them down or uses them as political footballs.I have no interest in doing that to you or to anybody else.I think the American people know you want a change, too.But let me just give you two or three examples.When I took office, the Labor Department had a nice executive dining room for its Secretary but not enough money to train unemployed workers.I'm going to propose a stimulus package that has some more money to train unemployed workers, and the Secretary of Labor is now eating in the dining room with the employees.When I took office, the White House had a telephone system that had been there since President Carter and a switchboard that has been there since the 1960's.They talk about jamming the White House switchboards&mdash;you can do it tomorrow if you want to; it's not hard.I could not have a conference call in my office on my telephone, except an unwanted one.Anybody in the central office could punch a lighted button and listen to what I had to say.It is not right for us to spend taxpayers' money on antiquated communications systems, on unjustifiable perks, and on a system that cannot be, cannot be justified to the American people, given the times that they're having and the sacrifices we're going to ask of them.In the next several days, I will be finalizing and announcing plans which will demonstrate a substantial reduction in spending at The White House, reversing many years of growth in services and personnel provided to the President.We're going to rely more on help from people in the departments to run the Government and on a new partnership to move the country forward.And we're going to set an example by saving money for the taxpayers, which will then have to be followed by everybody else in the executive branch and I hope in the legislative branch as well.Second, I'm going to ask, as I said, those who made more money in the eighties and paid fewer taxes to pay their fair share before I ask anyone in the working middle class to pay more.But we have to recognize that together we have to find a way to change the mix of Government spending away from so much consumption toward more investment and, at the same time, to reduce the deficit so we can bring interest rates down and bring up long-term living standards.We have no right, frankly, to continue to finance a Government budget that is 20 percent debt-financed, and will be more debt-financed in the years ahead, and leave it to our children to figure out how to live with lower incomes than they otherwise would have.And believe me, it isn't just our children.We're going to be living with the consequences in the very near future.And I might add something that all of you who work on budgets know, which is that one of the huge dilemmas we face&mdash;and that can't be resolved today in this speech, but I just want to lay it out there&mdash;is one that all of you know.And that is we are spending 14 percent of our income on health care.No other country except Canada spends more than 9, and they're just a little above 9.And every day we read in the paper another expert, just like there's one today, saying, well, you certainly can't save any money on health care costs in this country.God forbid that you should put any of that in there; you can't do that.If we can't do that, we can't fix the deficit; we can't fix the economy; we can't turn America around.And if we could lower the rate of health care spending increase, we would save more than twice as much money in the private sector and in the public sector, unleashing more money for investment than anything we can do in terms of tax cuts, spending increases, or anything else to turn this economy around.So there's plenty for us to do.What I want you to know is that I do not believe our problems are insoluble.And one of my major goals is to leave the next President with a new set of things to worry about.I want people to have to deal with new problems.I am asking you today to do two things: First of all, to personally invest yourself in this great mission.It is our job in this generation to deal with these problems so that the American dream can endure.Ultimately, that is why everybody should come to work for the Federal Government and why everyone's job counts.And I am asking you to remember how terribly difficult life is for many people who pay our bills and pay your salary and mine.I got an incredibly moving call the other day from a friend of mine, shortly before I took office, in which he said he had just talked to a person who worked in his office who said that&mdash;in bad grammar but compelling truth-he said, This woman came up to me and said, 'You know, it's scary to be a little people.' And it really is.I want to send a signal to this country that I may not do everything right, and I can't do everything that's just popular in the short run, but every day in every way we're trying to set an example for the people that sent us here.We don't want the people to sacrifice their income before the Government sacrifices everything it can.We don't want the people who bore the burden in the eighties to make any contributions before people who reaped the benefits of the eighties do their fair share, and that together we really believe we can make a difference.If you help me and we work together, I'm confident that we can.Thank you, and bless you all.",clinton
"Thank you very much.Congressman Emerson and distinguished guests at the head table; to my friend Reverend Billy Graham and Ruth; and to all those who have given such moving presentations.This has been a wonderful morning, I think, for all of us.When I heard Wentley Phipps recounting our first, rather awkward meeting, I thought that I would admit to being Governor of Alabama just to hear him sing.I helped to start the first Governor's prayer breakfast in my State; it became a very important part of our life there.And every year I had the pleasure of delegating two Arkansans, one a clergyman or -woman and one a citizen, to come to this wonderful event.I thought about the first time I ever saw Billy Graham&mdash;appropriate to mention now.He came in the 1950's, in the heat of all our racial trouble, to Arkansas to have a crusade.And the white citizens council tried to get him, because of the tensions of the moment, to agree to segregate his crusade in the fifties in the South.And he said, If I have to do that, I'm not coming.And I remember I got a Sunday school teacher in my church&mdash;and I was about 11 years old&mdash;to take me 50 miles to Little Rock so I could hear a man preach who was trying to live by what he said.And then I remember, for a good while thereafter, trying to send a little bit of my allowance to the Billy Graham crusade because of the impression he made on me then.I am honored that all of you are here not for a political purpose.We come here to seek the help and guidance of our Lord, putting aside our differences, as men and women who freely acknowledge that we don't have all the answers.And we come here seeking to restore and renew and strengthen our faith.In this town, as much as any place on the face of the Earth, we need that.We need faith as a source of strength.The assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things unseen, the Scripture says.What it means to me is that here, if we have enough faith, in spite of all the pressures to the contrary, we can define ourselves from the inside out, in a town where everybody tries to define you from the outside in.We need our faith as a source of hope because it teaches us that each of us is capable of redemption and, therefore, that progress is possible&mdash;not perfection, for all the reasons Reverend Graham said, but progress.We need our faith as a source of challenge because if we read the Scriptures carefully, it teaches us that all of us must try to live by what we believe or, in more conventional terms, to live out the admonition of President Kennedy that here on Earth God's work must truly be our own.But perhaps most important of all for me, we need our faith, each of us, President, Vice President, Senator, Congressman, General, Justice, as a source of humility, to remember that, as Bishop Sheen said, we are all sinners.St.Paul once said in an incredibly moving Scripture in the Bible, The very thing which I would not do, that I do, and that which I would, that I do not.And even more, not only because we do wrong but because we don't always know what is right.In funerals and weddings and other important ceremonies, you often hear that wonderful verse from Corinthians cited: Now abideth faith, hope, and love, but the greatest of these is love.But the important thing is often left out, which is the verse above.Why is the greatest of these love? Because now I see through a glass, darkly ...now I know only in part.None of us know all that we need to know to do what we need to do.I have always been touched by the living example of Jesus Christ and moved particularly by all the religious leaders of His day who were suspicious of Him and always trying to trap Him because He was so at ease with the hurting and the hungry and the lonely and, yes, the sinners.And in one of those marvelous attempts to trick Christ, He was asked, What is the greatest Commandment? And He answered, quoting Moses, You shall love the Lord, your God, with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.And then He added, as we should add, This is the great and foremost Commandment.And the second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.Just 2 weeks and a day ago, I took the oath of office as President.You know the last four words, for those who choose to say it in this way, are so help me God.And the Chief Justice was giving me the oath, and I was trying to remember the words.And I said, you know, when I get to the end I'm going to think of the ringing voice of Washington and Jefferson and Lincoln and the Roosevelts and Kennedy and all the other great Presidents through the ages, and I will say so help me God with all the strength at my command.And I did.But deep down inside I wanted to say it the way I was thinking it, which was, So, help me, God.",clinton
"Good evening.Thank you.I know we're not really, but it feels like it's nice to be back in New Jersey.And I'm glad to have you here in the Nation's Capital.You may or may not be able to see this, but on the way in tonight, Bill Faherty gave me a New Jersey tie, which I have proudly donned.They even had a mirror outside for me to be able to tie it in a straight and appropriate fashion.I've just been here as President 2 weeks and a day, and I'm already hoping we can keep an infusion of people from the heartland coming in to keep us in touch with reality.I'm glad to see all the Members of the House here.Senator Bradley and Senator Lautenberg are voting tonight as the United States Senate attempts to work out the family leave bill.I do want to say a special word of appreciation to both of them in front of their constituents for not only the support they have given me but for the genuinely good advice across a whole wide range of issues.I have the sort of relationship with them which I really respect and which I hope the Members of Congress here will take to heart.Either one of them is liable to call me at any time of the day or night from places unknown.And I'm very, very grateful to both of them not only for their support in the recent election but for their involvement in the great issues of this time.I've been working hard for the last 2 weeks to try to be worthy of the trust of the voters of this country who gave me a chance to become President, including the people of New Jersey who voted for a Democrat for the first time in 28 years.I know you haven't always been able to tell it from the news, but I spent virtually all of my time working on the economy, the jobs issues, the deficit, meeting in long periods with my staff, with people from around the country who know about these matters, with Members of the United States Congress, working with people in both parties to try to end the gridlock and to reach agreement so that we can move forward.We've had, as all of you know now, an economic upturn in the last few months, and we hope that we are coming out firmly of the longest recession we've had in a good long while.There is much to be encouraged about in two or three areas.First of all, interest rates have been down for a good long while now, and millions of Americans have refinanced their homes or been able to buy new homes in ways that have generated significant economic activity.Second, and even more encouraging over the long run, there has been a big increase in the productivity of American businesses and workplaces.That is, after all, the key to our economic future.And finally, beginning in December with a little bit in November, but a big increase in December in consumer confidence, which has strengthened the consumer market in our country, something we hope will carry through for the next few months.Still, there are clear challenges before us.With all these good numbers coming in, very few new jobs have been created in America yet in this recovery.Most big businesses that are doing better are still downsizing; it's a part of their productivity.That happened all during the 1980's, when in every year of the 1980's the Fortune 500 companies reduced employment in total by more than a quarter of a million in the United States.But throughout much of the eighties, that reduction was more than offset by the creation of jobs in the small business sector.In the last couple of years and regrettably even in the last few months, small business is not taking up the slack because of the crushing burden of health care costs and because of the credit crunch, which is much more severe in some States and regions than others but which is a very serious problem for our economy.We also have a deficit that next year is projected to be $50 billion bigger as of December than we were told in August and is growing exponentially, even though the Congressmen who are here can tell you that they made a good faith effort in 1990 to rein the deficit in with spending cuts and tax increases they thought would do it.It didn't happen because the taxes didn't bring in as much money as they thought, but even more importantly because health care costs have continued unabated, rising at breathtaking rates.So that at the end of this year&mdash;those of you who pay health insurance will know this&mdash;but we now, alone of all the advanced countries in the world, are spending 14 percent of our income on health care.No other country except Canada is over 9.That is a terrific competitive disadvantage.It is costing you a great deal of money not only as taxpayers, for what you pay for Government health care, but in the private sector.And the hemorrhage is such that about 100,000 Americans a month are now losing their health insurance, many of them finding their way onto the public rolls and leading to explosive increases in the Governments health care burden.So as we look ahead to our challenges and as I look ahead to this speech I have to give on February 17th to the joint session of Congress, I still believe in the fundamental themes on which I ran for President: We have to increase job growth and income growth without increasing inflation.We have to face the serious problems of our urban areas and the serious problems of the underclass in ways that liberate the ability of all people to perform at high levels in this economy if we want to continue the increase in productivity.That means that we have to shift away in the money that you give us to spend, away from consumption, more toward investment.We have to increase investment in new technologies and education and training, in infrastructure and the things that will grow this economy.It also means that we have to provide more incentives in our Tax Code for investment in the private sector.And it means we have to act at long last to bring health care costs in line with inflation.If we did that, it would do more to free up private sector dollars to invest in economic growth than any tax cut I could sign into law or any spending increase that Congress and I together can enact.So we will begin in earnest as soon as this break is over to do those things that your National Government has never had to do simultaneously before: We will attempt to increase investment and reduce the deficit at the same time.It will require an enormous amount of discipline and a willingness to try some new things and to cut some things in ways that we have not done before.I hope you will all wish us well, and I hope you will tell every Member of your congressional delegation up here, without regard to party, that you know they're going to have to cast some difficult votes in order for this country to face its problems, and if they do it in good conscience and explain to you why you did it, you will not hold it against them.That's what they were hired to do, and you'll stick with them if they can do it.You know, when I was Governor&mdash;and I did that job for a dozen years, and I had a good time doing it&mdash;there were many times when I had to cut spending five or six times in a given year.And people would be a little disconcerted at first, but we never got in debt.And I was always proud of the fact that my State had such a disciplined system.We paid a terrible price for it during the eighties when times were tough.But because we rode them out, last year we ranked first or second in job growth in virtually every month when I was off running for President, not because of anything that happened last year but because of the foundations that were laid in investments, in being competitive, and in fiscal integrity, in keeping those books balanced.Those are the kind of difficult decisions we're going to have to make now.Not so long ago, you elected a Governor who had to make some of those decisions.And let me say that, again without attempting to be too partisan, the truth is that if you live in a State, you don't get to print your own money.You can't get in the mess that your National Government is in because you can't run that long without having the brakes come on, without throwing people through the collective windshield that keeps us all in the same boat.And I have to tell you that for all the pain that the decisions made by Governor Florio and the legislature then caused him and them, the truth is that your house is in order now.New Jersey is going to have a balanced budget without a tax increase, and you even have a rainy day fund at a time when many States are going bankrupt.Sooner or later, we all have to face the music.And when we do, we are normally rewarded.So New Jersey is being rewarded.Look at your credit rating.Look at the overall health of the economy.Look at the trends in the State.I hope that together with the Senate and the House, with the Republicans and the Democrats in this great Capital of yours, we can come to grips with our problems in ways that the American people will understand and embrace, perhaps with less political fallout, but I hope in the end with the same sort of stability and success that you have achieved with Governor Florio.And I hope you're proud of it, because I am.Let me just mention one other thing.I happened to think of this&mdash;it really hadn't occurred to me, but I think I ought to mention it.I asked Governor Florio, through the Trade Ambassador, Mickey Kantor, to serve on our intergovernmental advisory committee, because there's so much relationship now between our national trade policies and the policies followed at the State and local level for growth.I think he'll do a good job on that, but I wanted to emphasize it because a big part of our economic strength is in our capacity to export.While our administration has found it necessary to take some pretty tough positions on trade issues in the last 2 weeks, I want to emphasize to you I do not take those positions in the hope of provoking a trade war or raising trade barriers in this country but only so that we can have expanded trade on fair terms for ourselves and for all nations.We cannot grow this economy, and no wealthy nation can grow, unless there is global economic growth.And I want to pledge to you that I will do my best to help all the world-class companies headquartered in New Jersey have an environment in which they can grow and flourish in the international economy, with a trade system that is constantly expanding, but expanding on terms that are genuinely fair not only to ourselves but to our trading partners as well.I ask you all without regard to your party to wish us well.And I ask you one more time to give the Members of Congress here a pat on the back at the end of the dinner tonight.We're going to have a very challenging few months ahead of us.But it is an exciting time, and it is a fabulous opportunity for us to put our house in order and to deal with these problems and to move this country ahead.We are now positioned better than we have been in more than a decade to reassert the leadership of the United States economically and politically in the world in a way that is very positive if we will ensure future growth, get job growth along with economic growth, and put our financial house in order.I think we can do it if all the American people, again without regard to party, agree generally on the goal.We will disagree on the details, but in the end we will come to the people's business with a resolution.That's what you need, and most importantly, it's what your children need.We cannot afford to permit the Government to go on out of control, leaving our children with a legacy of debt and diminished living standards, when we can do so much better now.I want to thank you for what you have done, all of you in the private sector, to restore America's productivity to the breathtaking rates we've seen in this last quarter.We're going to try to give you that kind of productivity in your National Government.Thank you very much.He said, This is a Parker pen; it's for your wife.It's the nicest one they make.And then he said, And this other one's for you.But this is a gift for The White House, for the American people.And I hope a lot of you from New Jersey will see this when you come in and know that it is yours.We'll leave it there for all time from the people of New Jersey.Thank you.",clinton
"Today I am directing my administration to release $156 million to help low-income households throughout the Nation cope with substantial increases in home heating fuel costs.The significant and sustained rise in energy costs has posed a special burden on low-income families, in many cases forcing them to choose between food and other essentials or a bare minimum of heat in these winter months.Releasing these heating funds today will ease the burden on the Nation's low-income families by helping cover their higher home heating costs in the cold weeks and months to come.",clinton
"Mrs. Yandle, I never had a better introduction.Before we thank anyone else, I think all of us should acknowledge that it was America's families who have beaten the gridlock in Washington to pass family leave, people like this fine woman all over America who talked to Members of Congress, both Democrat and Republican, who laid their plight out, who asked that their voices be heard.When Senator Gore and I ran in the election last year, we published a book called Putting People First.I'm very proud that the first bill I am to sign as President truly puts people first.I do want to thank the United States Congress for moving expeditiously on this matter and for doing it before their first recess so that every Member of Congress who voted for this bill can go home and say, We are up there working on your problems and your promise, trying to make a better future for you.This sends a clearer signal than any words any of us could utter, that we have tried to give this Government back to the American people.And I am very appreciative that the Congress has moved so rapidly on this bill.There are many, many Members of Congress here and many others who are not here who played a major role in this legislation.Time does not permit me to mention them all, but I do want to thank the Senate majority leader for his heroic efforts in the 11th hour to make sure we passed this bill; Senator Kennedy and Senator Dodd for their passionate and years-long commitment to this effort.I want to thank the Speaker, Speaker Foley, and Congressman Ford, the chairman of the committee that had jurisdiction over this bill, and Congresswoman Pat Schroeder and all the other Democrats who worked on this bill.But I want to acknowledge, too, consistent with the promise I made in my Inaugural to reach out to members of both parties who would try to push for progress, that this bill also had passionate support among Republicans.My old colleague in the Governors' Association, Senator Kit Bond from Missouri, I thank you for your leadership.Senator Jeffords and Senator Coats I don't believe are here, but they supported this bill strongly; and Congresswoman Marge Roukema from New Jersey, her commitment on this was unwavering; Congresswoman Susan Molinari from New York and many other Republicans voted for, spoke for, and worked for this bill.I thank them, the subcommittee chairs who are here, and all the others who worked so hard to make this bill a real live promise kept for the Congress to the people of the United States.Family medical leave has always had the support of a majority of Americans, from every part of the country, from every walk of life, from both political parties.But some people opposed it.And they were powerful, and it took 8 years and two vetoes to make this legislation the law of the land.Now millions of our people will no longer have to choose between their jobs and their families.The law guarantees the right of up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave per year when it's urgently needed at home to care for a newborn child or an ill family member.This bill will strengthen our families, and I believe it will strengthen our businesses and our economy as well.I have spent an enormous amount of time in the last 12 years in the factories and businesses of this country talking to employers and employees, watching the way people work, often working with them.And I know that men and women are more productive when they are sure they won't lose their jobs because they're trying to be good parents, good children.Our businesses should not lose the services of these dedicated Americans.And over the long run, the lessons of the most productive companies in the world, here at home and around the world, are that those who put their people first are those who will triumph in the global economy.The business leaders who have already instituted family and medical leave understand this, and I'm very proud of some of the business leaders who are here today who represent not only themselves but others all across America who were ahead of all of us who make laws in doing what is right by our families.Family and medical leave is a matter of pure common sense and a matter of common decency.It will provide Americans what they need most: peace of mind.Never again will parents have to fear losing their jobs because of their families.Just a week ago, I spoke to 10 people in families who had experienced the kinds of problems Mrs.Yandle has talked about today.Vice President Gore and I talked to people all across America who moved us deeply.We were saddened to hear their stories, but today all of us can be happy to think of their future.Now that we have won this difficult battle, let me ask all of you to think about what we must do ahead to put the public interest ahead of special interest, to pass a budget which will grow this economy and shrink our deficit, and to go on about the business of putting families first.There's a lot more we need to do to help people trapped in welfare move to work and independence; to strengthen child support enforcement; to reward those who work 40 hours a week and have children at home with an increase in the earned-income tax credit so we can really say we're rewarding work instead of dependence; to immunize all the children of this country so more parents won't have to take advantage of family leave because their children will be well and strong and healthy.Let all of us who care about our families, our people, the strength of our economy, and the future of our Nation put our partisan and other interests aside and be inspired by this great victory today to have others when Congress returns to this city and we go on about the people's business.Thank you very much.",clinton
"Canada-U.S. Relations Good afternoon.I'm delighted that my first meeting as President with a foreign leader is with the Prime Minister of Canada, Brian Mulroney.On the day after I was elected, I spoke of the essential continuity of our country's foreign policy.Our steadfast relationship with Canada is an indispensable element of that continuity.Prime Minister Mulroney and the people of Canada should know that the United States is still their friend and their partner.It is worth noting that the United States and Canada share the world's longest undefended border and that we haven't had a battle between us since the War of 1812.Now having said that, Mr.Prime Minister, I will tell you that I look forward to winning back the World Series.Today Canada is demonstrating her international leadership for peace and freedom through her commitment of troops in peacekeeping efforts around the world, in Somalia, in Bosnia, and elsewhere.Canada is our largest trading partner.Both our nations benefit enormously from the immense river of goods and services flowing across our border, with an increase of $30 billion just since the free trade agreement went into effect.It is remarkable how relatively few disputes have attended the vigorous trading between us.Yet it is inevitable that there will be some disagreements even among close partners.And we agreed today to maintain high-level attention to that trading relationship, to ensure that the problems are addressed before they become crises.The Prime Minister and I discussed the North American Free Trade Agreement.I assured him that my administration intends to move forward with NAFTA while establishing a process to provide adequate protection to workers, to farmers, and to the environment.Canada was our partner in working with Mexico to negotiate NAFTA, and Canada will be our partner as we move forward to put it and its related agreements into effect.We've made a good start here today in setting the stage for working together.We also discussed the GATT agreement, and I reassured the Prime Minister that the United States will do what it can to secure an agreement at GATT that all the world can be proud of and can be a prosperous part of.We reviewed a broad range of global issues, including the developments in Russia and elsewhere in the former Soviet Union, the crisis in the Balkans, the situation in Somalia and Haiti.We also discussed our participation in the Group of Seven and what the United States and Canada might hope to achieve this year, and especially this summer when the G-7 meets in Tokyo, to help move the global economy out of recession and into a strong recovery.This was a very good beginning.I want to thank Prime Minister Mulroney for coming down from Canada and tell him that he'll always be welcome here.And I look forward to visiting you on your home turf soon.Prime Minister Mulroney.Thank you, Mr.President.I'll simply say that, as the President indicated, we had a very full review of quite a large number of items in the few hours we spent together and a very productive working lunch.I thought it was a very good meeting and a very good beginning of the relationship of Canada with the new administration.The President has indicated the complex issues that we've touched on, tried to deal with, principally, of course, and I think you'll understand, the relationship between Canada and the United States itself.The relationship is by far the most important one the United States has in the world.This is the biggest trading relationship ever between two nations.And at the end of the year the important thing is it tends to be in rough balance, which indicates that you can have free trade and prosper.And so we're very concerned about the GATT, and we're very concerned about trading currents generally and very reassured by the President's strong commitments and strong positions in respect of the manner in which you bring back and reenergize prosperity around the world.So we covered our bilateral arrangements, and we covered a lot of the hot spots around the world.And I'm sure that the President and I would be happy to take a few questions.President.Prime Minister, what do you think of the changes the President wants to make in the NAFTA agreement? Prime Minister Mulroney.That may change.If it does, I'm sure we'll hear from the President.But our information is that, by and large, that the NAFTA agreement with those supplemental accords is something that he could promote and defend very vigorously.I think, Mr.President, that's the position.That's right.And I might add that the Prime Minister's administration in Canada has had a strong record on the environment, something that we want to try to beef up in a supplemental agreement, and that Canada would be, I think, more or less in line with the United States in terms of its impact on any supplemental labor accord we might reach.So we certainly intend to work with them.After all, this is a three-way agreement, not a two-way agreement.But I still believe, as I said many weeks ago, that we can negotiate these agreements without reopening the NAFTA itself.plan? And how long do you think that negotiations can be relied on before stronger action is taken? Perhaps the best way to answer your question would be to let the Prime Minister communicate his views, which he communicated to me, and then let me tell you what my response is.Shall we do that? Prime Minister Mulroney.We believe that the elements of an agreement, impacted by the concern of the United States and Canada in the area of human rights, in the area of war crimes, for example, can be&mdash;these amendments can be of significant substance without altering a lot of the hard and constructive work that has taken place so far by Cy Vance and David Owen.But it would be important that in this process at the Security Council there be greater involvement by Russia and by President Yeltsin.And I took the liberty of making some recommendations along those lines to the President, and he'll reflect upon them and probably have something to say.Let me answer now to just reaffirm what our present posture is.We have given the Bosnian situation urgent consideration.We have reviewed a wide range of options.We certainly will take into account what the Prime Minister has said.Our reluctance on the Vance-Owen proposals, while I applaud the effort both personally and as President, is that the United States at the present time is reluctant to impose an agreement on the parties to which they do not agree, especially when the Bosnian Muslims might be left at a severe disadvantage if the agreement is not undertaken in good faith by the other parties and cannot be enforced externally.So we are looking at that.I think one of the things the Prime Minister said is absolutely right: If there is to be a diplomatic political solution to this over the long run, we very much need President Yeltsin involved and the support of Russia.He reaffirmed to me just a few days ago in our telephone conversation his general support for the policy that we have outlined.But I'm sure you can understand why with a problem this difficult, we would like a few days longer just to seriously review this to come up with what our policy is going to be.Then we'll announce it as clearly and forcefully and follow it as strongly as we possibly can.President, the same question, please.As the Prime Minister has said, our Secretary of State met today with President Aristide and discussed a wide range of issues with him as well as what our efforts have been, the progress and the lack of progress of Mr.Caputo's efforts.We talked about where we're going with this relationship in the figure.Let me say that I am committed to restoring democracy to Haiti.I am doing my best to work through the U.N.and the OAS with Mr.Caputo.I am, frankly, disappointed that the Prime Minister in Haiti has apparently backed off a little bit of his original willingness to let us send in some third-party observers, not just to protect the petitions for refugee status but also to try to stabilize conditions leading toward a restoration of democracy there.And we're going to talk to Mr.Caputo, see where he thinks things are, and then reassess our position.But I share the Prime Minister's determination.The United States and Canada should be and are one in our commitment to restoring democracy to Haiti.And we will continue to push ahead either on the course we're now on, or if that fails, on a more vigorous course toward that end.We touched peripherally on the Middle East because the Secretary of State is going to, I gather, to the Middle East at an early moment.The position of Canada, my own view is that we tend not to try and give Israel lessons in regard to the determinations it has to make about its own national security.Israel's entitled to make some important value judgments about itself.That being said, I congratulated the President and the Secretary of State for their leadership in bringing about the first step of the return of the hundred deportees, which I think was an excellent example of diplomacy and international leadership by the President.It's the first step.It's not the whole answer.And it's a complicated matter which I think will be resolved&mdash;where the resolution of which will be clearer after Secretary of State Christopher has had an opportunity to visit the region.But I think that we're supportive of the U.N.resolutions, but I'm always very concerned when people start to lecture Israel on the manner in which it has to look after its own internal security, because for very important historical reasons, Israel, of course, is better qualified than most to make determinations about its own well-being.President, on Bosnia, do you expect that there would be an American diplomatic initiative to replace what you see as the flaws in the Vance-Owen initiative? I can't say that at this time.As I say, I applaud the efforts that have been made by Lord Owen and by Secretary Vance.I think that they have done the very best they could.And I don't criticize the details so much as&mdash;it's not a criticism so much as a reluctance on the part of the United States to impose on parties an agreement which they do not freely accept themselves, particularly one that might work to the immediate and to the long-term further disadvantage of the Bosnian Muslims.But I would not rule out any option at this time.We have a wide range of options under consideration.We are working very hard on this.We will settle on a course and then do our best to consult with our allies and win broad support for it.You heard the Prime Minister say that over the long run we need President Yeltsin's involvement in this, and I agree.You heard me say that we hardly ever do anything in foreign policy that we don't have Canada's support in, and we'll need that.So we've got a lot of work to do on this.We've been working very hard and we'll try to bring it to a quick closure.I hope we can revive them.Our biggest problem in this country is the expiration of fast track authority.But we have begun a lot of talks in earnest within the administration about that.I've done my best to send a signal to our trading partners and to the parties to GATT that we very much want a successful agreement.And I'll have more to say about that in the days ahead.Thank you.I take it by what I believe was your French, of what then was a good translation I got, that you mean by complexity of the situation in Haiti the fact that Father Aristide was plainly elected by an overwhelming majority and is plainly still&mdash;has the support of an overwhelming majority of the people; but while, in the brief period when he was in authority, made some statements which caused people in the military and others to have fear for their security, their personal security, in ways that are inconsistent with running a democracy, which has to recognize human rights&mdash;does that present the complexity? Yes, that is the nub of the issue.We have to be able to restore democracy in a way that convinces everybody that their human rights will be respected and, for an interim period, protected.And obviously, that's what the Caputo mission is designed to do.But the complexity of the issue cannot deter us from the fundamental mission, which is to restore a democratically elected government that will not abuse the human rights of ordinary Haitians.And I agree with the Prime Minister, we certainly ought to be able to do that here in our backyard, and we're going to work hard on it.Thank you very much.Prime Minister Mulroney.Thank you very much.",clinton
"Let me say, first of all, welcome to the White House.Mayor Jackson, I saw your brother earlier today at the signing of the Family and Medical Leave Act, and he was bragging on you, said you're now as thin as he is.I assured him I would still be able to recognize you when I saw you.We had a great signing this morning.It was a great bipartisan effort; about a third of the Republicans in the Senate voted for it.And it was a really good, good way to start the day.I'm glad you're here.I know you've been meeting with Secretary Cisneros, who's one of your own.Most of you in this room I know well.I've spent a lot of time in your communities, and you have played a major role in my political education.I assure you that I think every day about many of the places we've been and the things we've seen and the things that I have learned from you.I think that the time I spent in our country's cities in this last election, that was in many ways the most instructive time that I spent.And one of the things that impressed me so much is that so many things, against all the odds, are being done that work.And I want you to help me now figure out how to make those things that work the rule rather than the exception in American life.I told the Governors when they came in here and spent some time with me earlier this week on the subject of health care that if somebody asked me to name my greatest failing as a Governor after 12 years, it was that I never could quite figure out a way to make the exception the rule, to take those things that worked and make them work everywhere.In that connection, I have been working with Secretary Cisneros and have sent, after working it out with him, a directive to him today to deal with a number of specific things that I know are important to all of you: First, to establish a weekly mechanism for communication with the State and local leaders of our country on issues of housing and urban development.And I hope we'll have a chance to talk about both of them because they are related, but they aren't the same.Second, to try to expedite the programs that are already there now, to unclog some $6 billion that have been inexplicably tied up in the pipeline of the Federal Government that have already been appropriated; to speed up by 3 to 4 months the processing of the over $3 billion in public housing funds that are available and to try to accelerate the real implementation of the HOME Program where there's $2.5 billion in largely unmoved funds because the administrative system of this Department has been largely paralyzed.I told Henry when I asked him to take this position that there was some risk because of the pall which had been cast over HUD and the problems of past years and because there had been a lot of rhetoric but not enough action out of the Department in recent years.We're going to do what we can to marry rhetoric and action.We don't promise to shut up, but we promise to try to do some things.I also want to tell you that I'm going to do the best I can in this upcoming stimulus and economic package to do what I said I would do: to bring down the deficit but to increase investment at the same time in ways that will make available more funds for the cities.I remember, Mayor White, when we were in Cleveland with Congressman Stokes, you said you thought we ought to increase the community development block grant funds because you could move those more quickly to create jobs.And there will be a fairly sizable increase in that in the proposed stimulus package to try to help you create jobs.Let me just make a couple of general remarks about where we are on this whole economic approach, and then I'd like to hear from you, and I'd like to just be as informal and conversational as possible.The economic news is good but mixed and incomplete.That is, starting in the last quarter we have begun to have two pieces of good economic news.One is that productivity is increasing, and that's good.Companies are making more money.They're figuring out how to compete in a tough international environment.Two is that there's a lot more economic activity around housing as low interest rates finally are letting millions of Americans refinance their home mortgages, others get into buying homes, and that's all been good.Then since the election, there have been two good pieces of economic news that I think the election can fairly claim some credit for.One is that consumer confidence started going up in November and exploded in December, and it's going to be strong in January.The second is that the financial markets generally are upbeat about the direction that our administration has outlined, which means they take us seriously that we're going to try to do what many say is impossible, which is to increase investment and reduce the debt at the same time.So, that's the good news.The bad news is that in this economy, the downsizing of big firms is continuing apace.It started in the 1980's, when every year of the 1980's the Fortune 500 together reduced employment in the United States by about 400,000 people per year, big, big reductions in employment.In most years, that was offset by job increases in small and medium-sized companies.Now that is not happening, even though this recovery is in place.So you have this strange thing where the economic indicators are going up in the last quarter like crazy, but the unemployment rate is higher than it was at the depth of the recession.And for 14 months we've had a national unemployment rate over 7 percent.Why is that? I think there are several reasons, but let me just say there are plainly three.One is that small business cannot afford to hire new workers and make up the slack from big business cuts because of the exploding costs of health care.Two is that the small businesses that want to hire workers can't get credit because of the credit crunch, which is more heavily concentrated in some places than others and particularly in California and southern Florida-Mayor Lanier, still in Texas&mdash;but generally across the country.The third is that the defense cutbacks have accelerated the loss of high-wage manufacturing jobs without any offsetting industrial strategy or conversion strategy in America, which has been particularly devastating for southern California, for Connecticut, and for one or two other places, but has been generally felt across the country.So the first thing I've got to try to figure out how to do is how to keep this economic recovery with all these big numbers going but to actually help real people out of it.How are we going to generate some more jobs? One way is to put some more money into basic construction, which would affect you.We're going to try to accelerate the funding of ISTEA, which would help you.We're going to try to put some money into this stimulus package.It will be modest because we don't want to be accused of ignoring the economic indicators, but it will be substantial to several areas.And the other is to outline a 5-year investment plan which will increase our investment in infrastructure, which will have a defense conversion plan, and which will attempt to address these very serious problems that are killing small business, namely controlling health costs and providing basic health care to all Americans and trying to break open the credit crunch.If you think about it, two best things I could do for you are both indirect.If we could bring health costs in line with inflation and get banks to lending again, economic activity would pick up among people who would then pay taxes to your local government, and you could take that money and do what you need to do.The best thing I could do for the private sector, if we could bring health costs in line with inflation between now and the year 2000, we would save the private sector 2 1/2 times as much as the public purse, freeing hundreds of billions of dollars a year to be reinvested in the economies of this country.So, what I'm going to try to do is just that.It's never been done before in this country, having to bring down the deficit and increase investment at the same time.It's going to require some very tough choices.I spent 2 hours yesterday trying to cut the budget in areas that I thought were inessential in order to free up monies that would be invested.And obviously most of our investment money goes directly back to State and local government.I'm sure that a lot of you will wish we were spending more.But let me say that it is critical, I'm convinced, that we show some discipline in bringing down this deficit, because every point we drop long-term interest rates frees up $50 billion for new investment in this economy.So I'm going to try to spend more in terms of investment and reduce the deficit, which means I'm going to have to cut consumption even more.And we're working on it.And I hope that we can work together closely, and we can do a very good job together.One of the things that I've been impressed with&mdash;Secretary Cisneros' work over at the Department-is he came back saying what a lot of our Secretaries have said.He said, This thing's not working very well when we've got all this money out there that's not even being spent.We've got $6 billion in the pipeline.We got $3.1 billion that's been approved that's going to take 4 months too long to get out there.We've got this HOME Program; nobody can access the money because of the administrative problems.So, we can keep you busy for a year or so if we just run the Department right.And we're going to do our best to do that.I think the floor is now yours.Thank you.",clinton
"Dear Mr. Chairman: In accordance with section 490(h) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (FAA), I am submitting a list of countries which, as of January 1, 1993, have been determined to be major illicit drug producing and drug transit countries.These countries have been selected on the basis of information from the March 1, 1992, International Narcotics Control Strategy Report (INCSR) and from other U.S.Government sources.The list of countries is identical to the one submitted by the Secretary of State on October 1, 1992, pursuant to the provisions of section 481(k)(3) (now repealed) of the FAA and using the definition of a major illicit drug producing country and a major drug transit country given in sections 481(i) (2) and (5) of the same law.The International Narcotics Control Act of 1992 (INCA) amended the FAA on November 2, 1992, by changing the reporting date to January 1, 1993, and by suspending the sections 481(i) (2) and (5) definitions for fiscal years 1993 and 1994.In fiscal year 1995 the section 481(i) definitions will again apply.Since the section 481(i) definitions, however, have provided a generally sound and' consistent basis for classifying major drug producing and transit countries, we will continue to use them with some practical adjustments to take into account more accurate measurement techniques and the effect on the illicit U.S.drug market.We will not add or remove countries to or from the major drug producers list until we have our own confirmation that conditions in the country so warrant.We expect to revise the list during 1993 based on information in the next International Narcotics Control Strategy Report and survey information.At this time, there are reports that there may be significant illicit cultivation of opium poppies in Vietnam and in the former Soviet Central Asian republics.When we complete the relevant surveys of these countries, we will decide whether the data justify their inclusion on the list.The following countries are subject to certification on narcotics cooperation: The Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Jamaica, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Venezuela, Afghanistan, India, Iran, Lebanon, Morocco, Nigeria, Pakistan, Syria, Burma, China, Hong Kong, Laos, Malaysia, and Thailand.",clinton
"Good morning.I want to make a statement this morning and then turn the microphone over to the Vice President to discuss the environmental issues.And then he will take questions on the matter.Today I am announcing the creation of a White House Office on Environmental Policy, keeping a commitment that both the Vice President and I made to the American people to bring new leadership and new energy to these issues.And I am today reinforcing my intention to work with the Congress for legislation that will make the Environmental Protection Agency a part of my Cabinet.We face urgent environmental and economic challenges that demand a new way of thinking and a new way of organizing our efforts here in the White House and in the National Government.This Office represents in action our commitment to confront these challenges in a new, more effective way, recognizing the connection between environmental protection and economic growth and our responsibility to provide real leadership on global environmental issues.We must move in a new direction to recognize that protecting the environment means strengthening the economy and creating new jobs for Americans.And we must be ready to take advantage of the absolutely enormous business opportunities that exist both here and around the world for new environmental technologies that protect the environment and increase business profits and jobs.The days of photo-op environmentalism are over.The Competitiveness Council is closed and so is the back door the polluters used to be able to use to get out from under our laws.This Office represents our commitment to the environment and to a new, more efficient and effective way to craft policies that work, policies that recognize that protecting the environment, strengthening the economy, promoting the global environment, and dealing with global environmental problems have all too often been relegated to the bottom of the agenda.These are policies that will renew for the American people a genuine commitment to their health, their safety, and their jobs.This Office will be responsible for coordinating environmental policy.The Director of the Office will participate in the National Security Council, the National Economic Council, and the Domestic Policy Council and will work with all the relevant agencies.I am pleased to announce today that Kathleen McGinty will lead this Office and its efforts.We are today changing the way Government works, replacing the Council on Environmental Quality with a new office that will have broader influence and a more effective and focused mandate to coordinate environmental policy.The American people look to us to make Government work better and more efficiently and more effectively for them.We are taking an important step in that direction today.The American people, our economy, and our environment will benefit as a result of this.And I'd like to say a special word of thanks to Vice President Gore for the work that he has done on this since the election.We have been working hard now for more than 2 months to determine exactly how we ought to reorganize our environmental efforts and how we could integrate the environment, for the first time really, into national security policy, national economic policy, and other domestic policies.I think we've taken a long step in that direction.I thank the Vice President for his leadership, and I turn the microphone over to him.",clinton
"Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to sign these Executive orders, and then I will go over to the microphone and make a statement about each one.The first order requires by attrition a reduction in Federal positions of 100,000.The second order is a reduction in the administrative costs of the present Federal Government by 3 percent per year on average leading up to 5 percent in the 4th year of this 4-year term and abolishing several boards and commissions.The third order deals with the commissions.These are memoranda to the Department heads.One deals with perks; one deals with Government vehicles; one deals with aircraft.The people demand and deserve an active Government on their side.But they don't want a Government that wastes money, a Government that costs more and does less.They voted for change.They wanted a literal revolution in the way Government operates, and now you and I must deliver.Yesterday I announced the reorganization of the White House staff that will reduce our staff by 25 percent and cut costs by $10 million per year.Today I have called you, the Members of the Cabinet, together to take the next step, to begin the overhaul of Government as a whole.The steps we're taking today will save the American taxpayer $9 billion.They won't be easy, but they will make a difference.We have an obligation and an opportunity to change the way Government works and to show that Government can do more with less.Our Government needs change.For the last dozen years I've heard our leaders call loudly for less Government while giving people more Government and, perhaps more importantly, while giving almost no attention to better or different Government, to new ways in which partnerships could be made with people in the private sector and in State and local governments.Too often in the last decade people have rushed to defend the power of the few at the top and privileges of the elite, not just in the private sector but also in Government.Too often when economic security of ordinary Americans has been threatened, Government has sat still, refused to lead; not even follow, just get in the way.That era has come to an end with our coming to office.Today the Cabinet and I are taking several steps to show that we intend to change the way that Government works.But I want to make it clear this is only a beginning, not the end of the process.First, I am ordering a reduction of the Federal bureaucracy by at least 100,000 positions over the next 4 years.At least 10 percent of these cuts must come from senior management.The cuts can come from attrition; I see no need for layoffs.These cuts will make our Government more efficient and more effective.The Government is full of dedicated people whose hard work is being choked off by our own bureaucracy.Second, I'm ordering each Federal department and agency to reduce its administrative, as opposed to its program, costs by 12 percent over the next 4 years.With better planning and innovation we can make better use of the money we already have.In many agencies overhead is too high, red tape is too thick, and the day-to-day operations of the agencies have not been reexamined in a very long time.I believe Government can both care about people and be careful with their money.Third, I am today ordering the elimination of hundreds of unproductive and duplicative advisory commissions that have spread across this Government like kudzu.I'm asking the Office of Management and Budget to eliminate at least one-third of the 700 advisory boards and commissions that were not created by Congress.From now on agencies and departments will not be allowed to create new commissions without permission from OMB.We simply cannot allow the Federal bureaucracy to beget more bureaucracy.Finally, we have to shrink the gulf between Government and the average citizen.Too often success in Washington is measured not by results but by perks.Today I've issued three directives that will begin to limit perks and privileges that have driven a wedge between Washington and the public: First, an end to widespread use of home-to-office limousines by top officials and a reduction in the limousine fleets overall by half.Second, I'm tightening the rules for using Government airplanes and ordering an inventory of the airplane fleet with an eye toward eliminating unnecessary planes.Many people believe that there are substantial savings here.Finally, I'm ordering the elimination of such perks as below-cost executive dining rooms and free membership in private health clubs.However, I do want to say to you, as I just told the Cabinet before we came in, this administration was also elected to provide a health care plan for the American people, including setting a good example.And one of the ways I want to do that is to keep people healthier.So, I will also encourage every Government agency to provide health facilities in any building of any size, as long as they are provided on equal terms to all employees from the building maintenance people to the Secretary of the Department.These Executive orders are just a beginning, but they're a good beginning.We will now move on to really try to find ways to reinvent the way Government works and relates to people: how we can empower people more and entitle them less, how we can have more effective partnerships with the private sector and with State and local government, how we can find some of the dramatic productivity innovations that have characterized our finest companies over the last few years.I'd like to now call upon a few of our Cabinet Secretaries to discuss some of the things that they have been doing in their agencies, beginning with the Labor Secretary, Secretary Reich.Thank you.Secretary Cisneros.One of us has had a big problem to deal with in the last few days, and my impression is that he's done quite well.I'd like to ask Secretary Espy just to give a report about the crisis he's been dealing with and what his recommendation has been.President, changing the subject, since Secretary Christopher is going to talk about Bosnia this afternoon, could you at least tell us are U.S.troops a part of the initiative that will be unveiled this afternoon? I think I should let Secretary Christopher give his speech first.We have all worked very hard on this Bosnia policy ever since we took office and even before, trying to find a way to do more but do it with the support of our allies and through the United Nations.I think I'll let him give his speech, and then I'll be glad to answer questions about the policies after he does.I think they will want us to do more and want us to do it in a prudent way.And I think that they will support this policy.",clinton
"Thank you very, very much.Thank you for coming out on this cold day to make me feel warmly welcome to Michigan.I want to say how grateful I am to be back here again.This is my first trip out of the Nation's Capital as your President.The first time I've ever been on Air Force One, I flew here to Michigan.I want to say a word of thanks to Chairman Dingell and your wonderful Congressman from this district, David Bonior, and all the Members of Congress who are here, and Senator Levin and Senator Riegle.I want to thank my good friend Governor Blanchard, who flew here with me from Washington.I want to thank all of you who are here, and I'd like to say a special word of thanks to the men and women in uniform who are here in this crowd who serve our Nation every day.I know you're grateful to them.I want to thank the people of Michigan, without whom I might well not be here as President today, for your support in November and your support in March, and, more importantly, maybe, for all the things that I learned here in Michigan.When I was a boy, the first thing I ever knew about Michigan, growing up in Arkansas, was it was sort of the land of opportunity for our people who couldn't make a living on the farm anymore.They came here and became middle class citizens by working in the auto plants or by other industries that were successful.When I came here as a candidate for President, I didn't know whether I could do very well.And after I came home the first time, I called my wife.I said, Every other person I met was from Arkansas; we're going to do all right up here.When I came back to Michigan in this Presidential campaign I found a different picture, not all bad by any means but much more mixed.I saw in Michigan people who were developing new industries and new technologies and new hope for the future.I saw people working together across racial lines.But I also saw industries dying on the vine and people who had worked all their lives losing jobs and losing their health care.And I saw people divided by race, too.I saw everything about America writ large here in this State: all that is best, all that is most troubling.But I saw an awful lot of hope, too.Today when I left the White House to come here, we had a crowd of folks come out on the lawn to say goodbye, and when I knew that we'd bring in some folks just from the public who were there and some people who work in The White House, many of whom had never met the President before.And I had so many people who work in correspondence who were telling me that the letters are coming in at record rates here, massive numbers of letters for me, for my wife, for my daughter, people writing us about their hopes, their dreams, their new ideas.I'm going to do a town hall meeting tonight, a televised meeting connecting four cities, not just Detroit but three others, too, and all across the country.You know, between June and November I did nine of those.But I started a year ago in New Hampshire doing them, because I believe that people like me shouldn't hide from the people who elected them.I think we ought to be accountable.There will be many difficult and challenging days ahead.But if you'll stay in touch with me, if you'll let me hear the truth of your feelings and your ideas, when you agree and when you disagree, I think we can change this country.And if you will give courage to your elected officials and tell them that that's what you voted for, for a change, that as difficult as it may be to change, staying where we are is the most expensive course of all, we can do it.You know, shortly after you elected me to President, I was given my first piece of good news and my first piece of bad news.The good news was that consumer confidence was up and people were feeling better and people thought we could change the economy; that American companies, in a tough global environment, were becoming more productive; that interest rates had come down some and people were financing their home loans.The bad news was that no new jobs were being created in our economy and that incomes were not going up and that after the election it was announced that the Government deficit was going to be $50 billion higher next year and just about that high every year thereafter during my term of office.And so I had to go back to the drawing board and figure out how we were going to put the American people first, take on the special interests, invest in jobs and incomes and deal with the health care crisis and still bring the deficit down, as I promised to do, and to do it in a way that is fair to the middle class, people who've worked hard and paid the bills for 12 years.It isn't easy, I'll tell you that.But I'm doing my best.We have spent literally hours and hours and hours, the administration people and I, and I've met with large numbers of people in Congress, many people many times, since I became President just 3 weeks ago, doing almost nothing but focusing on this economy.And I am telling you I am confident that if we'll make some challenging decisions now and put this country on the right path, we can lift this economy up, we can create jobs, we can deal with the health care crisis and have a bright future.But remember: Everywhere I went in this election I said, Do not vote for me if you're going to quit on election day.Do not come to the Inaugural and celebrate the victory unless you're going to help us make the victory good.I need your help.I didn't see a single soul all those thousands of miles I traveled on those buses, stopping on the country roads and going to the big cities, I never did see a person holding up a sign saying, Everything's just fine.Leave well enough alone.Not the first sign.Even the people who honestly disagreed with me on a whole range of issues never said they believed that we didn't have to have the courage to change.And so tonight I ask you, watch what we do closely.If you think I'm wrong, call or write and tell me.But continue to support me with your prayers and your voice and your conviction, and give the Members of Congress the courage to change.That is what the election was all about.And we are going to try to make good on it.Thank you, and God bless you all.",clinton
"Thank you, thank you very much.Let me, first of all, thank all of you for being here in Michigan, and thank our audiences in Washington and Georgia and Florida for joining us, and all the people across this country who are watching this event.I started doing these televised town meetings a year ago in New Hampshire.Between June and November I did nine that were televised alone, including one here at this station.And I wanted to come out of the White House 3 weeks to the day after I became President because I can see now, after only 3 weeks, how easy it is for a President to get out of touch, to be caught up in the trappings of Washington, and basically to be told by people that nothing needs to be changed or you can't change things.Let me just briefly say, I want to take as much time as possible for questions, but I want to say one or two things real quickly.I believe I got elected on a commitment to change America, to create jobs, try to raise incomes, to face the health care crisis, to try to liberate the Government from special interests and turn it back to the people, and to try to reduce the deficit and put America on a path to long-term health and recovery, bringing the American people together.There's been some good news and bad news since I won the election.The good news is that productivity of American firms is up.People are buying houses because interest rates are down.Consumer confidence is up since the election.I like that.People think things are going to be better.There's been some bad news.With all these economic improvements, we aren't generating new jobs.And the deficit of this country is about $50 billion a year bigger than I was told it was going to be before the election.So we have to put together a plan that keeps my commitments to you, invest in you, in your jobs, in your education, your health care, and your future; that brings that debt down; that deals with the health care crisis; and that does it in a way that's fair to all Americans.I've been working almost exclusively on the economic issues of the country since I became President.I've got another week to put it together.And I wanted to come up here tonight and just listen to your questions, answer them as candidly as I could, and share with you as much as I can my feelings about where we're going to go.But I'll say this: All the hundreds of thousands and maybe a million miles that I've traveled, I never saw one person along the highway with a sign that said, Things are just fine the way they are.Don't change anything.So I'm going to keep trying to change, and I'm going to try to stay in touch with you this whole 4 years so that you can honestly tell me what you think.I'm really proud of the fact that the voter turnout was not only up, we not only had the biggest crowd for the Inauguration in history, but the mail and the phone calls in the White House are running at record levels, some good, some critical.But that's good.That's democracy.And it proves that people really feel, at least so far, that I'm going to listen and try to move forward.And that's what we're here to do tonight.So let's begin.Bill Bonds.Thank you very much, Mr.President.You know, in reality there are several town meetings tonight besides our audience here at WXYZ.The President is going to be taking questions from people in three other major American cities.From the far northwest, we welcome the people at station KOMO in Seattle, Washington.Ken Schramm will be the moderator, bringing us questions from the people of that Evergreen State; Ann Bishop, our moderator from station WPLG in Miami, Florida; from our station in Atlanta, Georgia, Bill Nigut taking questions from the people visiting him at station WSB.The response from the people in these American cities has been overwhelming.And we'll begin right now by taking a question from a member of the audience here at WXYZ in Detroit and see if this bird's going to fly tonight.Our first question is from Susan Esser.Susan Esser was the political coordinator for the Ross Perot campaign for the Presidency in the State of Michigan.I suspect this is going to be about&mdash;well, it's the economy, stupid, as we heard&mdash;the economy.President, feel that Congress does not have the political will to balance the budget.If this is true, and as you say, if the economy is your priority, will you support a strong balanced budget amendment, one that is not watered down, and with us send a signal to Congress that we need them to face the issue? And when can we expect Washington to start to solve this enormous problem of ours? I think you can&mdash;first of all, I'm not for any version of the balanced budget amendment that I have seen because I think it is basically a gimmick and a way of putting the decision off that would give us 5 years to deal with it.Secondly, if we balanced the budget tomorrow, we'd drive unemployment up because it would require such terrible sacrifices.I hate to say this again, but if you look at what the Japanese did, they had a huge deficit in the 1970's, about as big, even a little bigger than ours is now.And they brought it down over about a 10-year period until, in 1990, they were the only major industrial country with a balanced budget; one reason, they had low unemployment and high growth.Let me just tell you what I'm going to do, and I wouldn't rule out other measures later.I'm going to try to get the Congress to pass the modified line-item veto bill that the House passed the last time and the Senate didn't.I strongly support it.I'm going to try to pass a strong campaign finance reform law and a lobby reform law to free the Congress of undue influence of special interests.I'm going to ask them to cut spending, and dramatically, across a broad range of areas, and to raise some more money to try to bring this deficit down in a dramatic way that will send a signal that we're in control of our own house again.And we're going to lower interest rates as a result of it and get this economy going again.I think that's what we want.The important thing is not to balance the budget overnight but to put it on a steady and decided downward tack.If we don't do it-let me just say, there's no virtue in any of this unless it helps you.Let me just answer this.A lot of people say to me, Why do you want to balance the budget? It's no fun cutting spending or raising more money to balance the budget or reduce the deficit.If you reduce the deficit, the United States doesn't borrow so much money.We have more of your tax money to spend on the education of your children or on developing new jobs or on health care.We keep interest rates down, and it's easier for you to borrow money in the private sector.So you create more jobs.If the deficit gets bigger and bigger and bigger every year, it weakens the economy.So we have to do two things at once that no Government in your country's history has ever done.We've got to increase investment in jobs and reduce the deficit, and we're going to do it.And I think we can start next week.Look at my plan.See how you like it and see if the Congress responds.I predict to you that they will respond in a bipartisan fashion and reduce the debt for the first time in a long time.Mr.Bonds.Mr.President, we've kicked it off with that first question.Thank you, Susan.We're going to keep this moving right along.Let me throw it now and link up with Ann Bishop from station WPLG in Miami.Ann Bishop.Thank you very much, Bill.And with me is Kelly Kaprin, an attorney, and she has a question for the President.Kelly.Let me answer the question separately.I chose to deal with the family leave bill because I knew there was a majority support in both Houses for it and because I thought it was a pro-family bill.I thought it was a bill that would be helpful to strengthen the American family with so many people forcibly in the work force.It contained an exemption for small business.It had been passed twice by the Congress before and vetoed.I thought it would help families and illustrate we had ended gridlock.I tried to put off the gays in the military issue for 6 months.Senators in the other party wanted it dealt with now.They saw it as a way to delay family leave and to throw the whole Federal Government into debating that.I actually spent very little time on the issue myself.I met with the Joint Chiefs on a number of issues, including that; met with the Senate Democrats on the Armed Services Committee.But I was, frankly, appalled that we spent so much time the first week talking about that instead of how to get the economy going again.It wasn't my idea.My agreement with the Joint Chiefs was to study the issue for 6 months, so we could focus immediately on the economy.Thank goodness that's what we're now doing.Mr.Bonds.Some people say you probably would have been better off if you had sat down with Sam Nunn and maybe somebody like Admiral Crowe, a couple of the heavyweights in the U.S.Senate and say, Look, how do I approach this thing with the Joint Chiefs of Staff? and not get the mess that we got into.That's just what we did do.The Joint Chiefs wanted to meet with me on that and other issues.I met with them.Senator Nunn got into this because I asked him to.I hate that it was written, particularly in Georgia, that there was some conflict between us.I asked him to help me craft a resolution to do what the Joint Chiefs asked, which was to review it for 6 months and to put it off.We did our best, but there were others in the Senate, mostly Republicans, who just wanted to debate it to death because they thought it was hurting the other efforts we were making.And now we're on the economy, and that's where we ought to stay.Mr.Bonds.Mr.President, we're going to switch now to Atlanta, a little bit closer to your hometown part of the country.Bill Nigut, WSB.Bill.Tax Increases Bill Nigut.Mr.President, we're glad that you could join us by satellite from Detroit.We're going to start with Katie Rapkin, who works here for the Atlanta Symphony and who is a bit concerned about at least one of the campaign promises that she believes you made and yet she feels&mdash;you're not quite sure he's going to follow through on it.Mr.Nigut.Nigut.Well, first of all, I did put out a plan which didn't contain a middle class tax increase, but I also repeatedly said, and I said in the debates in front of 100 million people, I refuse to say read my lips.That's not responsible.Now, what's happened since the election? We have been told since the election that the Federal debt every year is going to be $50 billion bigger than we were told it was before the election.I wish I could promise you that I won't ask you to pay any more.But I can tell you this: Look what I'm doing.I'm doing my best to keep my campaign commitments.I have, first of all, started by cutting the Government.I cut the White House staff by 25 percent yesterday.I bet that's never happened in the lifetime of anybody in this audience.And it's real cuts.Today I announce $9 billion in cuts in the central administration of the Federal Government, $9 billion.I have also said that before I ask the middle class to pay, I'm going to ask the wealthiest Americans and companies who made money in the eighties and had their taxes cut to pay their fair share.And I'm going to cut more Government spending.But I cannot tell you that I won't ask you to make any contribution to the changes we have to make.We have got to do two things at the same time.We've got to bring the debt down for the reasons that the first questioner so clearly articulated.And secondly, we've got to invest more in creating new jobs, in educating people, and providing health care for all Americans and controlling cost.I'm doing my best to do that in a way that is fairest to middle class America.But I have to be honest with you: The debt is $50 billion a year bigger than we were told it was before the election.I'm doing my best.I have done nothing almost for 3 weeks but wrestle with this budget, try to cut costs, and find ways to finance what we have to do.But we've got to change what we're doing.Let me say I do have an alternative.I could play the same kind of games with you that have been played for the last 10 or 12 years.And this is not a partisan comment.This happened out of Washington.I could give you a bunch of smoke and mirrors and pretend the deficit is not there, and then 3 or 4 years from now we'd be spending 20 cents of every tax dollar paying off the debt.And it's not right.So I'm going to do the best I can.Listen to what I say next week.Decide whether you think it's fair, and tell me and your Senators and Congressmen whether you think I'm right or wrong.Crime and Gun Control Mr.Bonds.Mr.President, there are a lot of people who are convinced that the Federal Government doesn't spend enough money battling crime.I don't have to tell you about the mean streets of America.This man is John Marbury.His son was killed in the city of Detroit for a leather jacket.Right, Mr.I would like to ask Mr.Clinton what advice would he give to the administrations of these large urban areas of how to get rid of these illegal handguns and curbing the violence with an immediate impact? I wish I knew how to have an immediate impact.And I thank you for having the courage to come here tonight, with all the pain you must feel.Let me tell you where I think we ought to begin.We ought to begin by passing the crime bill that nearly passed last year, which does two things: It gives the urban areas of this country more police officers for the streets.I have been in areas that were dominated by drugs, by weapons, and by murders, which are now virtually crime-free because they have enough policemen.They have neighborhood policemen walking the streets on every block, working with their neighbors.That's the first thing.The second thing that bill has is the Brady bill that would require a waiting period before people could buy handguns.And the third thing we probably ought to do is do what Governor Wilder in Virginia is trying to do.It takes a lot of guts to do that, but he's trying to pass a law which says that you can't buy a handgun more than once a month.Try to stop all these people that go to legal gun stores and buy guns and then turn around and just give them to kids like they're going out of style.So those are three places that I think we ought to start.And if you've got any other ideas, I'd like to have them.I think the problem of violence among young people, particularly in our inner cities and not all big cities, is maybe the biggest problem we've got today in terms of their future and the future of our cities.I'm now preparing a jobs package for the Congress that I want to try to boost the job-creating capacity of the economy for the next year or so while we bring the deficit down, because I don't want unemployment to go up.And one of the things I want to do is give extra incentives for companies to invest in inner cities.But they're not going to do it if they think it's not safe.You can't have a job in a place where people can't walk to work safely.Mr.Bonds.The most powerful lobby perhaps in the U.S.Congress is the NRA, and they don't want gun control.How are you going to overcome that? We're going to fight to change.All I can tell you is, that's what I hired on to do.I may not win every battle I fight, but that's one of the changes we ought to make.And let me say, I live in a State where more than half the people have a hunting or fishing license or both.I believe in the right to keep and bear arms.I believe in the right to hunt.I believe in all this.I do not believe that we're well served by having a bunch of 14- or 15-year-old kids out there with handguns shooting each other because of blood battles between gangs or because they're mad or because they're high on drugs.It's wrong.We've got to do something about it.Mr.Bonds.We've had some difficulty linking up with our station out in Seattle.We switch there now to Ken Schramm, KOMO.Aerospace Industry Ken Schramm.Thanks, Bill.I'd like to introduce Larry Brown, who is a machinist with the Boeing Company.I'm going to go out on a limb here and suggest that perhaps you have a question concerning the economy.Good evening, Mr.President.Good evening, Larry.Recently, Pratt Whitney announced 10,000 layoffs, and over 200,000 aerospace workers have lost their jobs in southern California.At last report, the governments in Europe involved with the airbus consortium have subsidized their industry to a tune of $26 billion.My question is, how can America meet the challenge of maintaining our leadership in the very important aerospace industry? The answer, I think, is twofold: First, a lot of those aerospace workers who lost their jobs, lost their jobs because of cutbacks in defense which had to come at the end of the cold war.That is, we couldn't keep spending so much more than all of our competitors in these high-wage countries on defense without paying an economic price for it.But we shouldn't have cut defense as much as we did in terms of high-tech, high-wage employment without a plan to reinvest in other industries, in other technologies, to put those people to work.So the first thing we have to do is to invest more in converting these high-wage jobs to other technologies.The second thing we need to do, frankly, is to take a serious look at the aerospace industry itself.The Congress passed a bill last year that was never enacted that we're now trying to get up and going, where I will appoint someone and they will appoint some people to a commission to focus on how to rebuild the aviation industry in our country in two ways: Number one, people who work for Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, and other subsidiary companies&mdash;how can we get more jobs in making these planes and selling them at home and around the world.And number two, how can we do something about the commercial airlines themselves to avoid further bankruptcies and massive layoffs like&mdash;we've got a Florida station here with us tonight.Miami has been devastated by layoffs at Eastern and Pan Am.So we are going to work on that.And I assure you that I'm going to have a strategy to try to invest in commercial aviation.And we're also going to either have to&mdash;either the Europeans are going to have to quit subsidizing airbus and trying to deny us access to those contracts, which is something else that's going on now, or we're going to have to meet the competition.I am not going to roll over and play dead.Seven, seven technologies are going to shape the high-wage jobs of the future.And one of the biggest is commercial aviation.The United States has a lead there.We are losing it because we have not fought to maintain it.And I assure you, as soon as I get this budget and this investment plan, this jobs program sent up to the Congress, we're going to start working on defense conversion and aerospace.Mr.Bonds.We're going to switch now to Ann Bishop, WPLG, Miami.Florida Disaster Assistance and Military Base Closings Ms.Bishop.Thank you very much, Bill.And of course, we've not only had the devastation of the air industry but also Hurricane Andrew.And I want you to meet now the Reverend Walter Richardson, who certainly lives in the area that was hardest hit.President.On August 24th, many of the things that we had in the south Florida area were gone.One of the things that was gone because of Hurricane Andrew was Homestead Air Force Base.What plans do you have for the restoration of Homestead Air Force Base? Well, First of all, let me talk generally about the hurricane.There is a lot of aid left to go to south Florida which has been approved but not spent, that's tied up in various Government pipelines.Some of it was not pushed through under the previous administration.But I have to say, frankly, some of it was slowed down because of the transition, the change of governments.That happens.And I'm going to put someone on that next week because of something Governor Chiles said to me.I want to put one person in charge of making sure that all the assistance that's supposed to go to south Florida for Hurricane Andrew actually goes there as quickly as possible.We'll run through all those Departments and try to push it out.On Homestead Air Force Base: In the campaign, President Bush said that he would just rebuild it while we were closing a lot of other air force bases.The Congress voted against that and said Homestead had to be considered along with all other bases.I agree with that; I think we have to consider Homestead along with all other air bases.There's a base commission, and they will evaluate the needs for it.But let me say what I believe, based on having spent an enormous amount of time in south Florida and having talked to your congressional delegation about it and others.I think that is an invaluable asset.I think it is important to rebuild enough support systems so that all the retired military personnel, around the air base at least, don't lose the dependence they had on it and turn around and leave your community, which would be bad for you.I think it's important to find a mission for Homestead.And I believe that there are a number of multiple use missions which are potential.We may even have joint use between military and commercial uses.I've given a good deal of thought to it, and it's one of the things that I want to talk to you folks about.Now, if it clears the base closing commission, it will just be rebuilt with its mission.If it doesn't, then I think we need to look at whether there is a mixed use for it as both a military and commercial mission.It's an incredible resource for south Florida, and it has to be used as a part of the rebuilding process.So if the base is not rebuilt because the base closing commission doesn't recommend it, then I'll help you do something else with it to generate an equal amount of jobs.President.Ms.Bishop.Thank you, Mr.President.We'll throw it back to you, Bill, now in Detroit.Mr.Bonds.Okay, thank you very much Ann.We switch now to Bill Nigut, WSB, in Atlanta, Georgia.Bill.Homosexuals in the Military Mr.Nigut.Bill Bonds, as you know, the issue of lifting the ban on gays in the military has been a particularly heated one here in the South.Roger Turner wants to ask you, Mr.President, why you want to do it.Tell the President why you don't want him to lift the ban and see if he can respond to that.And I want to know, why do you want to lift the ban, and what impact do you see the ban having on the military? Mr.Bonds.Mr.President, does it surprise you to hear a minister&mdash;we also have a minister standing here who very much wants the ban lifted.Does it surprise you to hear a minister say we should keep the ban in place or continue a discriminatory pattern? Absolutely not, because a lot of ministers of the gospel believe that homosexuality is morally wrong and, therefore, that ground alone is enough to justify the ban.Let me tell you why I favor lifting it very briefly.We have now and everyone concedes we have always had homosexual men and women in the military service.I received a letter from a retired officer, a woman, the other day who told me she left the service because she could not be honest about her sexual orientation, even though she was a distinguished officer with a remarkable service record, one of many such letters I have received.Your Government spent $500 million to get rid of about 16,300 homosexuals from the service in the 1980's.Now, here's my position.If there are homosexual men and women in the service anyway, if we know they have served with distinction and they have always been there, the issue is should you be able to say what you are and not be kicked out.This is not about conduct.This is about status.I believe there ought to be the strictest code of behavioral conduct applicable here.I also believe there ought to be an even stricter code applicable to sexual harassment, whether homosexual or heterosexual.The biggest sexual problem in the armed services, according to the men and women who talked to me, involves heterosexual harassment.I think there ought to be a tough code of conduct.If people do wrong, they ought to be gotten out.But I think people should not be asked to lie if they're going to be allowed to serve, because the question is not whether they should be there or not.They are there.So the narrow question of this debate is should you be able to stay and admit it.The military itself has admitted they should stop asking people when they join.That's the position of the Joint Chiefs.So the only question here is should you be able to say that you're a homosexual if you do nothing wrong.I say yes.Others say no.The military is studying the practical problems about duty assignments and other things, and we'll revisit this in about 6 months.Mr.Bonds.I want to advise my stations along the link-up that it's time for us to take a break here.They'll be taking a break.Speaking about the military, we have military forces in the Persian Gulf.We have military forces still in the Kuwait area.Are we going over to Bosnia-Herzegovina? And we'll be back with that question for you, Mr.President, in just a moment.Bonds.I appreciate your enthusiasm.I think we'd save a little time if we'd hold the applause to the end so that you could get more questions in, the President of the United States could get more answers in.So you do what you want to do, but we feel it would be better that way.We have troops in the Middle East; we have troops in Somalia.Are we going to go into Yugoslavia? That's this young lady's question.President.Serbian death camps and rape camps have shocked the world.And today we have heard Mr.Warren Christopher stating that he supports negotiated settlement in Bosnia.How does one negotiate with war criminals without a clear enforcement to let them know that they have to stop with the atrocity? And how does one ensure that the Serbs will not continue with their atrocities and that they will negotiate in good faith and that they will lay down the arms? Will you ask NATO for their enforcement of the terms of agreement and give them the authority to use force in this case? And will you also help Croatia regain its sovereignty on the territories it's lost so that 700,000 people can return to their homes? Thank you.I'm glad you asked the question in the way you did.I was afraid you were going to ask me why we agreed to get involved in this process today.Just for the benefit of the people who don't know as much about it as you, let me tell you what happened today.Today the Secretary of State announced a new policy by our Government that we would agree to become more involved in what is going on in Bosnia, not in committing our ground troops now or anything like that but in trying to get involved in these negotiations to protect the rights and the integrity of the Bosnians, the Croatians, and others who have been basically subject to the assaults of the Serbs; that we would be in a position to say we're not going to enforce a peace agreement on the Croatians or the Bosnians that they don't believe in, but that if we could get an agreement, then the United States would participate, not alone but with the United Nations and with Europe, in guaranteeing that the agreement would protect the basic human rights of the people involved and the terms of the agreement.Now, people say, So we are not committing today to make war in the former Yugoslavia.We are committing to try to help get a peace and then to enforce it.Why is that? Because if we don't, number one, the terrible principle of ethnic cleansing will be validated, that one ethnic group can butcher another if they're strong enough to do it, at the end of the cold war; number two, that problem could spread to other republics and nations near there.Never forget, it's no accident that World War I started in this area.There are ancient ethnic hatreds that have consumed people and led to horrible abuses.You know about it, the rapes of the women, the murders of the children, all these things you have read about.We've got to try to contain it.And I think we have to be very much stronger standing up to aggression.We've got to get the heavy weapons out of utilization; you implied that.We've got to toughen the embargo against the Serbs.We ought to open a United Nations war crimes inquiry, and we ought to enforce the no-fly zone against Serbian aircraft, strongly.Those are the things that I think we should do.I do not believe that the military of the United States should get involved unilaterally there now.We have to work with these other countries.And I might say that that's the position that General Powell and our foreign policy folks have taken.But this is a much more aggressive position than the United States has taken.But I can tell you, folks: We're not going to make peace over there in a way that's fair to the minorities that are being abused unless we get involved.And if we don't get involved and the thing spreads all over creation over there, then we'll be pulled into it in horrible ways that could be very dangerous to our people.So we ought to do what is right now.It's also what is safest for the United States.Mr.Bonds.But isn't it a reality, Mr.President, that if the United States doesn't get involved and doesn't lead, nothing is going to change? I think that it is reality that if we don't get involved, either nothing will change or the Bosnians will be wrecked and the Croatians will be hurt badly.Mr.Bonds.And it could still spread after that.And it could go into Kosovo, which is next door; it could go into Macedonia.You could involve the Turks.You could involve the Greeks.We could have a serious problem.Mr.Bonds.Then you've got a major policy decision to make.I just did it.Mr.Bonds.I don't think she thinks you did make it.Let me just say, the United States has learned one thing: When we operate-look at the Gulf War.If we operate with the support of the United Nations and with the support of Europe and with the support of our allies, we can do a lot of things at an acceptably low cost of life, and get something done.If we go off on our own and everybody else is over here, we can't get it done.I have to deal with the fact that Europe believes today that negotiations are possible, that Russia wants negotiations from a different point of view.And even though they've been historically sympathetic to the Serbs, they have supported our position that we ought to toughen the embargo and stand up to aggression.And if I go in there, the United States now takes a leadership role, I think there's a real chance we can stop some of the killing, stop the ethnic cleansing, and get a peace agreement.And then we'll have to help enforce it.She's absolutely right.If we don't have an enforcement mechanism, you won't be able to do it.But I believe this is the best thing to do for the Croatians and for the Bosnians and for humanity at large in the former Yugoslavia.I think it's the right thing to do.Health Care Reform and Meat Inspection Mr.Bonds.Thank you, Mr.President.Ken Schramm, KOMO in Seattle.Mr.Schramm.Thank you.Mr.President, my understanding is that while you were en route to tonight's program, while aboard Air Force One you called an area hospital because you were concerned and wanted to speak to some parents and some children who have been affected by the E.coli bacteria contamination in this area.I'd like to introduce Vicky and Darrin Detweiler, whose 16-month-old son remains in critical condition at Tacoma's Mary Bridge Hospital.And they have a question concerning health care.President, actually our child is at Children's Hospital in Seattle, but he is in intensive care, in critical condition.And only 2 days prior to him going in there with E.coli poisoning from tainted meat, my husband lost his job, and we were left without medical coverage.I'm Canadian originally and always took comfort in the medical system there and in knowing that my children would be taken care off My question to you now is: What are you prepared to do in regards to the tainted meat problem, and is there any hope in the near future of seeing universal health care so no one else has to go through what we've gone through? Let me, first of all, say I thank you for being on the program, and I hope your child will be well.I did call two other sets of parents who are in the hospital with their children, on the way out here, just to inquire about that and to get their ideas about what we should do.Let me answer your second question first.As I'm sure you know, I've asked my wife to head a task force to come up with a bill within 100 days which will bring a new system of health care to America which offers us the chance to provide basic health coverage to everybody, to stop people from losing their health coverage when they lose a job, to stop people from their inability to change jobs because they've had someone in their family sick, and to bring the cost of health care in line with inflation.I think we can do that.And if we don't do it, we'll never balance the budget, and we'll never restore health to this economy.Fifty percent of the projected deficit growth between now and the year 2000 is all in health care costs.So it is a terrific human issue, but it's a big economic issue for Americans.And the answer to your question is: Within 100 days of my becoming President, we're going to have a bill to the Congress to do just what you've said.Now, the second thing, this E.coli thing-have you all been following it up in Washington? I asked the Secretary of Agriculture, Mike Espy, who is responsible for the regulation of the slaughterhouses and the meat before it comes to a restaurant, to go up there and look into the situation.And we think there are two things that have to be done.First of all, we've got to make it clear to people who are providing the fast food that they've got to do everything they can to comply with our cooking regulations.Some of these viruses would have clearly died had the heat been observed.On the other hand, we've got to find ways to do more inspections and to try to do them in a more effective way.And so we are reviewing now the possibility of not only hiring more inspectors, which I've already agreed to do, but secondly, seeing if there is some way we can do a better job of actually inspecting the meat, empowering the inspectors to do some more things.We have got to do that.And I can tell you, if you have any more ideas, I'd like to have them.The parents that I talked to today had some, actually, some quite good ideas that we're going to pursue.And I want to invite you and any others who are listening who have other ideas to let me know.But you can look forward to more inspectors, and we're looking for ways to inspect better as well.Mr.Bonds.In that case, you're increasing Government.We are there.But that's a direct service to people.That's not a waste of bureaucracy.I think the American people want us to make sure they're safe if we can.President, I'm a former Pan American Airline employee, and I'm still unemployed at this time.And I would like to know if you have any new provisions for people who suffer from big industries' traumas.Let me tell you, we're going to try to do two things.One is to provide a much more comprehensive program of retraining and job placement; and secondly is to try to have a strategy available when we know that major, major industries are going to shut down, to try to do conversion, to try to provide investment opportunities for new kinds of economic activities.I said earlier something that I probably should have broadened.This is not just a problem in defense industries.It's also a problem in other big employers.As we're in Michigan tonight, as the people in Michigan know, the biggest companies in America did nothing but basically lay off people in the 1980's and the early nineties.Even when they were making more money, they restructured.For the last 10 years, until 2 or 3 years ago, a lot of the jobs that were lost by big companies were made up by jobs that were created by small companies.About 2 or 3 years ago, that process slowed to a halt because of the cost of health care to small business, because of the general recession, because of the credit crunch.So my answer to your question is: We're going to be much more aggressive than American governments have been in the past in trying to find ways to deal with these problems when we know in advance they're coming, and go in and give people the chance to restructure their lives, to rebuild them, and try to create other kinds of economic activities with new partnerships in the private sector.We're also going to try to change the tax system to favor investment more.That is, we want to raise the corporate tax rate some.But then we want to say, if you want to lower your taxes, invest more.And you can lower your taxes if you invest to create jobs.And I think that will help a lot.We're going to try to do that.We obviously have plenty of space down here to have it done.But what kind of training are you going to give someone who's middle-aged or even older but who still needs to work? Well, I think that is both the burden and the excitement of the time in which we live.That is, there is nothing I or any public official can do about the fact that the average 18-year-old American today will change jobs about eight times in a lifetime.Even if you keep working for the same company, if you're lucky enough never to be laid off, in order to keep a job, an 18-year-old today will have to be retrained to do eight different jobs.So whether we like it or not, middle-aged people will have to keep learning new things, developing new skills.Now, that will be very exciting and interesting for people in their middle and later years if we can spare them of the gnawing insecurity of thinking they're going to be thrown onto the scrap heap of history, they're going to lose their job and never get another one, or they're going to lose their job and then getting another one making one-third of what they used to make.That's our great challenge.And we are working on it.That is something that I think America ought to be able to lead the world in, and now we're behind some of our other countries.President, is it possible to pay them and give them benefits as well, like health benefits, while they're learning? Oh, I think so.What we're going to try to do with this health care plan is to make sure that everybody, whether employed or unemployed, has access to a basic package of comprehensive benefits.Every other country in the world, advanced country, does this.Every industrialized country but South Africa does this, everybody.And yet we spend 30 percent more of our income on health care than anybody else.Now, if you have access to health care in America it's the best in the world&mdash;and a lot of good things about it.But there are ways to give people a choice of doctors, high quality care, and do it for lower cost if we're willing to take on the insurance cost, if we're willing to take on a lot of the other waste in this system, the phenomenal waste.The paperwork in the American health care system alone is enough to cover virtually everybody without health insurance.Let me just give you an example.In most hospitals in America today for the last 5 years have hired clerical workers at 4 times the rate of health caregivers like nurses, even though there's been a national nursing shortage.Why? Because we're the only country in the world with 1,500 separate health insurance companies writing thousands of different policies, covering small, small groups with a blizzard of rules that would choke a horse.Plus the Government makes it worse by the way we run Medicare and Medicaid.And we're going to try to fix it.It's the most complicated problem I've ever messed with.But if we don't fix it, we can't control the deficit, we can't restore health to the economy, and most important, we can't restore security to the lives of people like those who've asked these questions tonight.Child Care Mr.Bonds.Child care and the terrible dilemma that so many working parents have had finding competent child care has obviously been in the news a great deal recently, Mr.President.Hattie Henry lives in a community just north of Atlanta.She is a first-time mother with a 6-week-old baby.And you want to go back to your job as a nurse.You're struggling with that dilemma.I'm obviously going to be a working mother, and I'm very concerned about the child care crisis, which has finally been thrown into the spotlight with Nannygate.And I would like to know what your first thing is that you're going to do to address the child care issue, to make it affordable and reasonable.President.Bill, I'd like to ask your questioner a question first.The quality of what I can get for the affordability of what I can get; if it is even worth it to go back to work with what we have available.And what about working mothers who don't have any choice about going back to work? Where can they take their children and have it be affordable and quality care, where they're sure their children are safe and getting good care? Well, I think there are two or three things we can do that we're working on now.First is to work in partnerships with States to help them to develop high standards for child care but also quality care at affordable prices.And one of the things that we did in my State when I was Governor is to spend a good deal bit of our training money.For example, training people who are on welfare but who were quite intelligent and capable of&mdash;for taking care of their own children&mdash;to work in child care facilities and moving them from welfare to work in ways that took maximum advantage of money the taxpayers are spending already and lower the cost of child care.And we often put these child care facilities in and around job training facilities to help working mothers and working parents that were going back to school.Sometimes they were going to school and working at the same time.I think we can do that.The second thing we can do is to increase the earned-income tax credit for working Americans, especially middle to lower middle income working Americans, so that they will have more disposable income to pay their child care expenses.The third thing we can do is simply to increase the child care credit itself.We basically have got to make the economics of this work.And I think there are lots of other things that can be done, but they won't affect the population as a whole.The population as a whole needs to be helped by making sure you've got a steady stream of trained quality child care workers and then more income for middle-class people, either through the child care tax credit or through the general earned-income tax credit, which basically says if you work 40 hours a week and you've got kids in the house, you shouldn't be put into poverty because of your other expenses, including child care.The Government ought to reduce your tax burden, if necessary even give you money back, as long as you're working hard and playing by the rules and you need to take care of your kids.Kimba Wood Mr.Bonds.Mr.President, as long as we're on the subject, let me come in the back door on it and ask you the same question that many Americans apparently have felt, and that is, Judge Kimba Wood certainly did everything she could legally to attain child care.Why was she penalized, punished by being eliminated as a candidate for Attorney General if, in fact, she dealt with this rather difficult problem in a perfectly legal way? Well, first of all, I never selected her to be Attorney General.There was a press report that she was, and I regret&mdash;I think she was treated quite unfairly in this whole thing.I have high regard for her, but she was one of three or four people I was considering.Secondly, the facts of her case was that she did not violate the law, because in 1986 the law was changed to say if you knowingly hire an illegal alien, you're violating the law, but if you did it before the law became into effect, you're not violating the law.So a few months before the law was passed, she knowingly hired an illegal alien.Now, I think&mdash;and she did not do anything illegal.She knew the person providing child care was doing something illegal, but she didn't.But the question there that you can ask or answer, that I would have had to answer had I decided to put her up for Attorney General, is whether the Attorney General, who runs the Immigration and Naturalization Service, has a special standard to meet in this area that other Cabinet members might not have to meet.And that's a question that I would have had to resolve, had I decided to nominate her.One of the things that I think has been very good in this whole business is that we've now taken a lot of these issues out.They're now the subject of public debate, and I hope that we will be able to resolve some of them, including-you would be amazed how many people who come to my attention as potential candidates for various positions in Government honestly did not know that they had to take out withholding on anybody who worked for them if they spent more than $50 on them every 3 months.They just didn't know.And that's something that I think has really been raised on the public agenda.I think people are so much more aware of that than they were.You know, some people don't think that ought to be the law, but that's what the law is.Health Care Reform Mr.Bonds.Mr.President, a lot of people wonder if when your wife speaks on health care reform she is speaking directly for you and if that is the message that you're sending to the American people.Here's a young woman by the name of Marcie Hoffmaster; she's 17.She's going to be graduating soon.And you've got a tough future in front of you.I suffer from a chronic illness called systemic lupus, and I've already discovered that it will be almost impossible for me to get health care.I'd like to know what you're going to do ensure that people with a preexisting condition can get health care.And also, if the Government decides to regulate health insurance and prioritize illnesses, where will long-term, incurable illnesses, such as lupus and cancer and AIDS, stand on that list of priorities? Let me answer your first question first.The reason so many people with preexisting conditions can't get health insurance is because people are so often insured in very small pools.Like, look around here, suppose there are about 60 people in this room.Suppose all of us belong to a group health insurance, and suppose we have the standard array of illnesses and problems.And a couple of us have cancer, and you have lupus, and maybe one person has HIV, and all the rest of us are healthy as can be, right? It only takes one or two people in a group that small to bankrupt the pool.But in most countries, and in a few States in America, insurance companies are required to rate people for insurance according to huge community pools with hundreds of thousands of people in them, so that the risk of your care is spread across large numbers of people.And insurance companies make money the way grocery stores do, a little bit of money on a lot of people, instead of a lot of money on a few people.So the short answer to your question is, the way to keep preexisting conditions from barring people from getting health insurance is, number one, to make it illegal and, number two, to make it possible for the insurance pools to be big enough so that they don't go broke taking people like you.The second answer is, I believe, if you look at how much money we're spending on health care, if we can redirect a lot of the money that would be saved from administrative costs and from insurance overcharges per person, because of the system we have, if we could do more preventive and primary health care, if we can, in short, maximize the money we're now spending and keep people like you in big pools, I believe there would be enough money to cover your care.If that is not true, what the Government will have to do is to develop a Government long-term care program, because you cannot abandon people who have AIDS or who have prolonged bouts with cancer.In fact, a lot of cancer survivors, as you know, are living now for 10, 15, 20 years and during most of that time, even when there's a recurrence, are serving quite productively.So I think we have to do that.I just approved, by the way, a strategy to fully fund the Ryan White Act for the care of AIDS patients over the next couple of years, because I think that's an important issue.But we'll never do it, you won't be treated right until we have a national program that covers everybody.Mr.Bonds.Mr.President, we're going to move into kind of a round-robin here.We're going to throw it now to Seattle.Ken Schramm, KOMO.Antidrug Program Mr.Schramm.Thank you.I've got two quick questions for you here, Mr.President.The first one is from Rochelle Pinrod, who is 9 years old, has never spoken to a President before, but she has written you a letter.President, how will you help make a drug-free America so I can feel safe walking out on the streets, so that no one's going to come up and ask me, Would you like to buy some drugs? Good for yoy.There's no easy answer to your question.One thing I can do is to speak out.Another thing I can do is to hire a person to be our national drug czar, the developer of, the leader of our drug policy, who understands that you have to have a combination of things.You have to have a strong education program in the schools.You have to have a strong program in the communities to keep the streets safe and to protect the children and to give them something to do.And you have to have a strong enforcement program designed to break those people who are bringing drugs into our country in large quantities.I went to college with a person who's done a lot of very serious prosecution of people involved in and around drug transactions.And he tells me one big mistake we've made, for example, over the years, is not to go after people who make big money at it by chasing the money instead of the drugs.So all I can tell you is that drugs have affected my family.I hate what they are doing to America and to children's future.And I'm going to do what I can to fight it through education, through treatment, through opportunities for safety on the streets, and through trying to go after the people who are really causing the problems.Who's next, Bill? Mr.Bonds.Well, I have a young man here in the studio, but I think we're going to throw it to Miami.Ann Bishop, WPLG.Ms.Bishop.Thank you very much, Bill.We have with us Marlene Bashin, who has a question for you.Marlene.How do you explain these actions, especially at a time when the situation in Haiti is as bad as possible? Well, for one thing, the situation in Haiti is getting better.But let me tell you, I explain the action in the following ways: My policy is not the same as President Bush's policy because I'm trying to bring democracy back, because I am committed to putting more resources there to process people who want to be political refugees and can meet the standards and bringing them safely to the United States.And let me tell you why I did what I did.I did what I did because of the evidence that people in Haiti were taking the wood off the roofs of their houses to make boats that were of questionable safety, to pour in thousands of numbers to come to this country, when we knew for sure hundreds of them would die on the high seas coming here in a human tragedy of monumental proportions; and that if they came here, they would all come to south Florida, where the unemployment rate is high, the government is strapped, they don't have any money.And the Federal Government has constantly broken their commitment to the people of south Florida to help them deal with the immigrant problem.I decided that the better course was to launch an aggressive effort to restore democracy to Haiti and to launch an aggressive effort to protect people who want to apply to be political refugees in this country, in Haiti, and to process their applications all over the island, which is what we are doing now.And I might say, the ultimate proof that my policy is different is that President Aristide himself asked the Haitians to stay home and work with him to restore democracy.And if you noticed, just in the last day, the present rump government in Haiti has agreed to let us send observers there.And I look forward to fully changing the policy and in restoring democracy in Haiti.But I could not, in good conscience, let hundreds of people die on the high seas and create an enormous problem simply because the United States has not used its muscle to restore democracy to Haiti.That's the problem, and that's the one I'm trying to tackle.Mr.Bonds.But Mr.President, if you place or slap an embargo on Haiti, you don't hurt the people at the top, you hurt even more severely the people at the bottom.The embargo was there all along, and I support it.Mr.Bonds.Yes, but I mean, it gets worse.Look, if we lift the embargo, then what incentive does the government have to change? That is an unelected government there.The man who was elected President, everybody down there concedes, if he were on the ballot again today would win overwhelmingly.And we have got to try to restore democracy there.I want to lift the embargo very badly.I want to do more than lift the embargo; I want to help rebuild the economy of Haiti.That would be good for America.They could be good partners for us.A lot of the Haitians who are in south Florida would dearly love to go home.But I am not going to lift the embargo as long as there is a government down there oppressing the people.Media Relations Mr.Bonds.You can't do a town meeting every month, Mr.President, and many people in the White House press corps are saying, He's going to have to come and answer our questions.You've got about 50 seconds left to answer that question.How are your relationships with the White House press corps?I think they're all right.Mr.Bonds.They'd like to talk to you.I answer their questions just about every day.They come in and ask me questions, and I answer them.We don't see the world the same way.Mr. Bonds.Well, I think the point is, are there going to be many more of these? Oh, I hope there will be a lot of these.Mr. Bonds.Thanks, Mr. President.I hope there will be a lot of these.",clinton
"Thank you very much.I would like to thank all of you ladies and gentlemen for coming here to join me today.I would like to say a special word of thanks to the leaders of various organizations and sectors of our economy who came in a little earlier for a briefing.And thanks to the members of the administration who are here, who have been working so hard for the last 3 weeks on our economic program, and to the Vice President who went all the way to California last night to do a town meeting and came in about 5 o'clock this morning.He's the only person here who's had less sleep than I have.That's what Vice Presidents are for.Many of you have been my friends for some time, and you have worked with me in this campaign and in others.Many of you are members of the other party who love your country and care very deeply about the health of our economy.It doesn't matter.If you look at the history of our country, whenever the chips have been down, the private sector, the business community has rallied to help America meet its challenges in war and in peace.In two World Wars, business men and women were among the leaders in our great national mobilizations, putting aside narrow interests for the national interest.When our Nation faced challenges from civil rights to the energy crisis, businesses have taken the lead in coping with change.Americans are at their best answering alarm bells in the night.But I think every one of you know that today we face a crisis which, while quieter, is every bit as profound as those we have faced in our past.We risk losing the standard of living that we have taken for granted for so many years as Americans.Too many middle class Americans have already suffered through a decade or more of declining real wages and rising basic costs.Now, even though it is said we are in a recovery and the overall economic indicators are quite impressive, the job creation that normally accompanies a recovery is not in evidence.Small businesses are having trouble creating jobs because of the lack of the availability of credit or because of the costs of health care.Big businesses are continuing to restructure, not just manufacturing businesses now but service organizations, too, because of the demands of the global economy.Business people have to deal with the realities they face, and they often make annual plans and 5-year forecasts, based on the best numbers they can get.Your Government for the last several years has either not been making annual plans or 5-year forecasts, or they've been based on numbers which aren't real and plans which were never intended to be carried out.Early in my campaign for President I did what I had always done when running for Governor: I put out a plan which, as nearly as I could, set forth what I thought we ought to do as a country to increase jobs and incomes, to reduce the national debt, to restore the health of our economy, and to deal with the long-term problems we face.I wanted to increase investment, reduce consumption, restore fairness to the Tax Code and growth to the incomes of America, deal with the structural problems of this economy like health care and the credit crunch, and to do it in a context that would enable us to have long-term health by reducing the national debt considerably.I did it last year based on the numbers that were then available.I revised the plan again in late spring.In August the Government said that the deficit was going to be bigger than we had anticipated.Then, still, I thought we could do essentially what we had outlined.But after the election, the Government revised the deficit figures upward again, this time by as much as $50 billion per year in each of the next 4 years.Now I have a choice.I can do what has been done by people in both parties for the last several years and has certainly been done by administrations unwilling to give up the rhetoric of low taxes and less Government, even though costs were exploding: I can sort of deny the problem and finesse the numbers.Or I can tell you what I think is the truth.I think I should follow the latter course.I believe that given the size of this deficit, given the burden it will put on today and tomorrow in terms of higher interest rates, given the fact that we also have a plain investment deficit in the education and training of our people and the investment in our infrastructure and those things that are critical to building high-wage, high-growth jobs, we have to take even more dramatic action than I had previously thought to increase investment for jobs and incomes, restrain unnecessary Government spending, raise revenues in a fair way, and reduce the national debt so we can have long-term growth.I think if we do not do these things, we will pay for it.I think the cost of the status quo is far, far higher than facing our problems and moving forward.Business people have known for years that something had to be done about our deficit.The national debt has quadrupled since 1980.Even more disturbing, unless present trends are altered, the debt on an annual basis will explode in the years ahead with 50 percent of it coming from increases in health care costs.I want to reduce this deficit, not as an end in itself but because I think it is a critical part of a strategy to build jobs and growth for America today and over the long run.In order to do that, I need your support and your contribution.Everyone will have to pay their fair share.But if you do, we will all be better off, and the business community will be stronger in the years ahead.Government has an obligation to provide the proper environment in which business can prosper, but the private sector drives the economy.If interest rates are too high, if the financial system is in disarray, if health care costs are crushing out discretionary income which can be put into new plant and equipment or hiring additional workers, the environment in which we operate will be crippled because the private sector cannot work.I want to be a better partner than that to you so that you can do your job.Productivity has gone up at an astonishing rate in many sectors of the American economy in the 1980's and in the early nineties.This recovery, indeed, that we now see underway seems to be based on three things: home mortgages going down enough for people to refinance their homes and buy new homes; consumer confidence coming up since the election&mdash;I hope I can keep it up; but most important, dramatic increases in productivity in the private sector.Those productivity increases are not yet manifest in more jobs for the American people or higher incomes, and they won't be until we do something about health care, about the deficit, and about doing the things it takes to make our country as a whole competitive over the long run.That is what I am trying to grapple with as your President, and what I need your support beginning next Wednesday in the Congress with, so that we can make progress on these great issues.If we don't reform our economic policies, I'm convinced eventually we will fall further and further behind.Ten years from now we won't even recognize the country that we all grew up in.Ten years from now, if we don't change present policies, the following things will happen: The deficit will be $653 billion in a given year.The national debt will be 78 percent of our gross domestic product.Health care costs will take up almost 20 percent of GDP.They are at 14 percent today.Only one other advanced nation in the entire world, Canada, is above 9, and they're just a little bit above 9 today.Medicare and Medicaid costs will triple for taxpayers and people less able to bear the burden.We have got to change.The short-term pain of making changes now is so much less than the long-term cost of continuing to do things the way we're doing them.So next week I will try to propose an economic package that will give the American people fundamental change.A goal is an economy that faces the world without fear and not only meets but beats our rivals in economic competition around the world; an economy that is growing, that provides jobs to everyone willing and able to work, that does not rest until the great American middle class that built this country once again feels that people who work hard and play by the rules will be rewarded and not punished.The broad outlines of this plan are no secret, but I'd like to restate them.First, to ensure that we do not lose the momentum and the new confidence that we have seen among consumers and in the markets and to finally get sustainable job growth, I believe strongly that we need an investment-led jobs package.But all of us here know that our problems go beyond the business cycle.More importantly, we need a long-term plan to increase investment in the American people and their future.We will put in place a program of investment in the physical infrastructure that is a precondition for prosperity and productivity.Finally, we will reduce our deficit, not as an end in itself, as I said, but as a means to achieve higher incomes and more jobs.This will require tough choices from all Americans.And before I turn to the middle class for help I have to turn to people who did well in the last decade.This past week we began with the Government, where we ought to begin, setting our own house in order.Too often in recent years our Government has been on automatic pilot.And believe me, it's been a very long time since the kind of searching reexamination of the mission of Government has been undertaken that you do all the time, that you do just to survive.And so we are beginning a process of literally trying to reinvent your National Government so that we can increase its productivity, its effectiveness, and its ability to be a partner with you in the great enterprise on which we now embark.I believe that Washington has to change before we can ask America to change.On Tuesday I kept my campaign pledge to cut the White House staff by 25 percent below the level that I found it.That was a significant cut, but I want to emphasize to you I did it the way most of you would have done it.I didn't just slash the numbers.We have reorganized the White House staff, and I believe this smaller group will increase its ability to serve the American people.We now have an Economic Security Council to go with our National Security Council and our domestic policy operation.We're going to have a smaller drug policy operation, but it's finally going to have something to do with the rest of the Government.It's not going to be politics and speeches and posturing; it's going to be affecting the policies of every department of the National Government.We are going to have a smaller, but more importantly, far more productive White House.And on yesterday, we extended those measures to the entire Government, ordering a reduction in Federal bureaucracy by 100,000 people by attrition over the next 4 years, with at least 10 percent of those cuts to come from senior management, and ordering agency and department costs to be reduced by between 3 and up to 5 percent over the next 4 years, for savings in excess of $9 billion by administrative actions alone&mdash;and again, not cutting for cuts' sake but to redirect those monies to more productive purposes and leaving those departments not only leaner but more efficient than they were before.This is just the beginning.We are going to reexamine whether you're getting your money's worth.One of the people I spoke with already this morning said, I can give you some examples of things that work and things that don't in the National Government.I'll just mention one publicly because we all know it doesn't work: The Superfund has been a disaster.All the money goes to lawyers, and none of the money goes to clean up the problems that it was designed to clean up.Those are the kinds of challenges we expect to do a better job of meeting, perhaps with fewer people whenever possible, but with greater productivity.Now I ask you to do your part.We have to replace this social contract that somehow crept into our thinking in the 1980's, that somehow we had to have greater inequality in this country to get prosperity.That was the idea.Even in the years in which we created jobs, income inequality was exacerbated in America.Now I think we need a new compact.Everybody does his or her part, pays their fair share, joins our national effort, and garners the rewards of a growing economy.The plan I will offer will give a climate in which you can grow, investing in people and the best trained work force in the world, giving us the kind of flexible employees that we all need.That is Government's responsibility to work with you to do and one that we have not done a very good job of in the past.We want to lower the cost of capital through long-term reductions in the deficit.We want to provide special incentives to new enterprises with long-term capital gains treatment.We want to provide some changes in the Tax Code that will plainly reward investment as opposed to consumption in the business sector.But we also have to face the fact that the deficit will not vanish in a flash.We will cut it, and we will cut it as much as we reasonably can.And if our plan is adopted, it will be the first time since the 1940's that the Government has succeeded in dramatically slashing the debt.And I might add, it was inevitable then at the end of World War II, when the debt was running at about 120 percent of gross national product.We are going to work as hard as we can, and we desperately need your support to do it, to bring health care costs under control.I have to say this: If you want this deficit brought down, not for 4 years but for 8 or 10 years until we can do away with it, it will never, ever be done until we pass a national health plan to control costs and provide a basic health system for all Americans and to stop shifting costs onto you for people who aren't insured.It will never happen unless we do that.Fifty percent&mdash;let me reiterate&mdash;fifty percent of the projected growth in this debt between now and the year 2000 is in health care costs.And we only pay 33 percent of the national health care bill.More than two-thirds of it is being paid by you.And the same thing will happen to your cost.The best thing the President and the Congress could do for the American economy over the next decade is to bring health costs in line with inflation.It would free up hundreds of billions of dollars to reinvest in new jobs and higher incomes and greater productivity and growth.And we must not delay that.So I implore you not only to feel that you can be involved in our deliberations on what should be in the national health strategy but also to help us pass that, along with this budget, in Congress this year.I want to also do something the governments of our competitors do without apology.I think we ought to have pragmatic partnerships with the private sector to strengthen our technological leadership.Research and development resources should shift toward technologies that will translate into commercial successes.And we must work together to create a national information infrastructure.One of the things I've been determined to do in all these budget meetings we've been having for the last 3 weeks is to make sure that every dollar by which we reduce research and development in the defense budget finds itself into an increase in the domestic research and development budget of this country, and more.We have got to do that.We also should give you more incentives to invest, as I said.I want to reform the corporate tax system to ensure that it rewards and encourages those who invest in productivity: in plant, equipment, research and development, in people who will create the jobs and the markets of tomorrow.And in return, we must ask your contribution to bringing the deficit down.Let me say something I haven't said yet.We did not just cut the White House staff and the executive administrative costs of this budget.You will see there are a lot of other very real cuts in Federal spending&mdash;and they will be real, definable and measurable, not imaginary&mdash;that will be laid on the table before the Congress and the American people.Once we do that, we must ask for greater contributions to close this deficit.And we should begin with those whose taxes were reduced and whose incomes went up in the 1980's, the wealthiest Americans and corporations.I will ask for an increase, as I said in the campaign, on the income tax for the wealthiest Americans and corporations, along with the incentives that I have recommended to get people&mdash;lower their tax burden if, but only if, they make investments in this country.Our situation is worsened, and we may have to broaden the range of revenues which we seek.But we should begin by asking those who can most afford to pay to do so.I have also been persuaded by my Treasury Secretary that it is unwise, indeed impossible, to raise the individual income tax rate unless there is a corresponding increase in the corporate tax rate to avoid tax shifting.But the corporations should also have incentives to reinvest as their rates are raised.And so we have done both things in the plan we will recommend.I talked a lot in the campaign about an issue which has relatively small dollar impact but great significance to the American working people, and that is the enormously increased rate of executive compensation in the last 12 years as compared with the compensation of workers.I want to make a proposal that deals with the fact that the Tax Code should no longer subsidize excessive pay of chief executives and other high executives, excessive defined as unrelated to the productivity of the enterprise.I believe, finally, that if all of us do what we're supposed to do, if I can ask every American honestly to look in the mirror and say, What do I want this country to look like in 4 years? What do I want this country to look like in 10 years? What do I want this country to look like when my children are my age? Do I really want to let yet another opportunity go by when we just wander through a year instead of really investing in our people and our fixture, instead of really having a technology policy, instead of really having an economic strategy, instead of really doing something about the credit crunch, instead of really doing something about health care, instead of really doing something about the deficit, just because I wish I didn't have to change my ways?&mdash;I think almost every American will look in the mirror and say no, no, this year we'll pull together and do our part.If the business community leads the way, Congress will follow.I need your help.I hope you'll be there.Thank you very much.",clinton
"Thank you very much, Willie Brown.And thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for letting me join you by high-tech communications for just a few minutes.First of all, let me say how very impressed I was by the comment of the previous speaker.He may not have been in California very long, but I think his prescription for how to solve our Nation's problems, concentrating on investment and achieving consensus, is what we all have to focus on.I wish I could be with you in person today.You know, I have spent a great deal of time in California in the last 16 months talking to people about the problems and the promise of your State.I don't believe for a moment that America's economy can recover until California recovers, and I applaud what you are doing in this economic summit.I understand the economic summit that I sponsored down in Little Rock for our Nation may have been part of the inspiration for this meeting, and if so, I'm very grateful.I applaud Willie Brown and Senator Roberti and Governor Wilson for cosponsoring this, and all the rest of you who are part of it.Let me get to the point very quickly because I think that these summits work so much better when there is interaction, so I don't want to intrude on what I think is going very well.First, I want to reaffirm my commitment to the economic revitalization of California.Californians played a major role in my election as President and play a very major role in my Presidency now, people who are important to your future.Our Trade Ambassador, Mickey Kantor, has already spoken this morning; you know he's from California.The Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, is from California, and we're increasingly involving the State Department in the revitalization of the American economy.Our Budget Director, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Leon Panetta, was a Congressman from northern California and is here with me; I'm in his building as we speak today.And of course, the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, Laura Tyson, is from northern California.All of these people are in a position to bring their experience and knowledge to bear on what we in the National Government can do.In addition to that, I've already had an extensive visit with Senator Feinstein.I've talked with Senator Boxer.I've talked with many members of your congressional delegation about the issues that they have brought to my attention.And as I said, the time I spent there taught me a lot about the problems in California that are caused by reducing employment in the defense industry, by the collapse of real estate, by the problems in the financial institutions, by the general manufacturing difficulties, and by the increased costs brought on by immigration as well as the population increase generally in California.Let me say first that I'm convinced we're going to have to solve this problem by partnership.I am offering the American people a program which will reverse three big trends in our country which have affected California.We built an American dream, especially after World War II, based on increasing economic prosperity in a high-wage, high-growth economy, increasing equality among our working people, and making more and more strength out of our diversity.The economic and social difficulties we have faced in the last few years threaten to reverse all those trends.Wages are stagnant.Inequality has increased over the last decade, and our diversity has often been a source of great tension and division in California and elsewhere throughout the country.I'm convinced that in order to change this, the National Government has to take the lead, first of all in investing in our people, their jobs, their technology, and their future; secondly, in dealing with the health care crisis; thirdly, in reducing the enormous Federal debt to stabilize long-term interest rates and free up more money for investment in the private sector; and finally, by developing economic policies in partnership with the private sector which encourage more investment in the private sector and which enable us to work together to create that highwage, high-growth economy again.As that applies to California, it means we will be doing the following things: First of all, in my economic program there's a plan to jumpstart the economy, to create another halfmillion jobs in the near future.California will receive a significant number of those jobs.Secondly, I intend to follow through on the technology policy I announced in California in the last campaign.That means we'll be providing more incentives to start new enterprises and to expand existing enterprises and to build on the job-generating capacity of the technology-leading companies that are in your State.Thirdly, I want to invest in our children and their future and our educational system.I want to do what I can at the national level to alleviate some of the problems caused by the financial conditions you have there.Fourthly, I'll ask the Congress to change some of the tax rules involving passive losses in hope of alleviating some of the real estate problems in California, as well as giving industry more incentive to invest in the next couple of years.Next, Mr.Panetta and I have worked hard on trying to figure out how we can redesign some of these Federal programs so that the Federal Government can keep its commitment to the States that have been overwhelmed by immigration problems, California most of all, but also Texas and Florida and some other States who should have been helped more by the National Government because of the burdens they bear due to a national policy on immigration.Finally, let me just say, if I might harken back again to the last person who spoke before I did, California has some challenges that will have to be met by Californians.You will have to take the lead in improving your education system.I'm going to give you a good Department of Education that will help to reform the practices in education and to make education work again.But some of the premier reformers in America are right there in California now.You have to find a way to make their exceptions the rule in California education.And next, you will have to take the lead in making sure your manufacturing and production environment is at least competitive with other States in the United States, not by driving down wages but by changing the environment so that you can be competitive.I'll do whatever I can to support you.The best thing we could do here to help you with that is to solve the health care crisis: to bring health care costs in line with inflation; to make basic, affordable health care available to all; and therefore, to stop whatever incentives there are for people to move across State lines or to move their plants because they've got high embedded health care costs.But a lot of these productivity issues are going to have to be faced, and faced squarely, by the people of California and every other State.We're prepared to do our part.I'll say again: This country cannot rise again to its full potential until California is on the move again.I'm going to do what I can to help.I ask you for your support in my aggressive plan to reduce the debt and to increase investment in education and training, in new technologies, in new jobs, and in dealing with the health care crisis.I'll do what I can to support you.Together, we can turn this country around.We can lift California up, and California can once again be the beacon of hope for America and for the world.Thank you very much.",clinton
"Warm greetings to everyone celebrating Kwanzaa.One of the best ways we can shape the future is to preserve what we value of our past.The celebration of Kwanzaa is a wonderful example of this endeavor.With its focus on the values that have sustained African Americans through the centuries&mdash;unity, self-determination, collective work and responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity, and faith&mdash;Kwanzaa also emphasizes the importance of strong families and communities to our success as a nation in the years to come.African Americans have a proud history and a rich heritage.During this holiday season, as Americans of many different backgrounds remember and rejoice in their cultural and religious traditions, let us all give thanks for the diversity that is among America's greatest strengths, and let us unite around the shared dreams and values that bind us together as one nation.Hillary joins me in sending best wishes to all for a memorable Kwanzaa and for peace and happiness in the years to come.",clinton
"This report is submitted pursuant to sections 401(c) of the National Emergencies Act (NEA), 50 U.S.C.1641(e), and section 204(c) of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), 50 U.S.C.1703(c).Executive Order No.12722 ordered the immediate blocking of all property and interests in property of the Government of Iraq (including the Central Bank of Iraq) then or thereafter located in the United States or within the possession or control of a U.S.person.That order also prohibited the importation into the United States of goods and services of Iraqi origin, as well as the exportation of goods, services, and technology from the United States to Iraq.The order prohibited travel-related transactions to or from Iraq and the performance of any contract in support of any industrial, commercial, or governmental project in Iraq.U.S.persons were also prohibited from granting or extending credit or loans to the Government of Iraq.The foregoing prohibitions (as well as the blocking of Government of Iraq property) were continued and augmented on August 9, 1990, by Executive Order No.12724, which was issued in order to align the sanctions imposed by the United States with United Nations Security Council Resolution 661 of August 6, 1990.This report discusses only matters concerning the national emergency with respect to Iraq that was declared in Executive Order No.12722 and matters relating to Executive Orders Nos.12724 and 12817 (the Executive Orders).The report covers events from August 2, 1992, through February 1, 1993.1.On October 21, 1992, President Bush issued Executive Order No.12817, implementing in the United States measures adopted in United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) No.778 of October 2, 1992.UNSCR No.778 requires U.N.member states temporarily to transfer to a U.N.escrow account up to $200 million apiece in Iraqi oil proceeds paid by the purchaser after the imposition of U.N.sanctions on Iraq.These funds finance Iraq's obligations for U.N.activities with respect to Iraq, including expenses to verify Iraqi weapons destruction and to provide humanitarian assistance in Iraq on a nonpartisan basis.A portion of the escrowed funds will also fund the activities of the U.N.Compensation Commission in Geneva, which will handle claims from victims of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.The funds placed in the escrow account are to be returned, with interest, to the member states that transferred them to the U.N., as funds are received from future sales of Iraqi oil authorized by the United Nations Security Council.No member state is required to fund more than half of the total contributions to the escrow account.Executive Order No.12817 authorized the Secretary of the Treasury (the Secretary) to identify the proceeds of the sale of Iraqi petroleum or petroleum products paid for by or on behalf of the purchaser on or after August 6, 1990, and directed United States financial institutions holding such funds to transfer them to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) in the manner required by the Secretary.Executive Order No.12817 further directs the FRBNY to receive, hold, and transfer funds in which the Government of Iraq has an interest at the direction of the Secretary to fulfill U.S.rights and obligations pursuant to UNSCR No.778.2.The economic sanctions imposed on Iraq by the Executive orders are administered by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (FAC) pursuant to the Iraqi Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR Part 575 (ISR).The ISR were amended on September 1, 1992, to revoke section 575.603, which had required U.S.financial institutions to file monthly reports regarding certain bank accounts in which the Government of Iraq has an interest.While this information was needed during the early implementation of the regulations and for a period thereafter, it is no longer required on a monthly basis and can be obtained by FAC on a case-by-case basis as required.The amendment is in harmony with President Bush's Regulatory Initiative.3.Investigations of possible violations of the Iraqi sanctions continue to be pursued and appropriate enforcement actions taken.These are intended to deter future activities in violation of the sanctions.Additional civil penalty notices were prepared during the reporting period for violations of the IEEPA and ISR with respect to transactions involving Iraq.Penalties were collected, principally from financial institutions which engaged in unauthorized, albeit apparently inadvertent, transactions with respect to Iraq.4.Investigation also continues into the roles played by various individuals and firms outside Iraq in Saddam Hussein's procurement network.These investigations may lead to additions to the FAC listing of individuals and organizations determined to be Specially Designated Nationals (SDNs) of the Government of Iraq.5.Pursuant to Executive Order No.12817 implementing UNSCR No.778, on October 26, 1992, FAC directed the FRBNY to establish a blocked account for receipt of certain post-August 6, 1990, Iraqi oil sales proceeds, and to hold, invest, and transfer these funds as required by the order.On the same date, FAC directed the eight United States financial institutions holding the affected oil proceeds, on an allocated, pro rata basis, to transfer a total of $200 million of these blocked Iraqi assets to the FRBNY account.On December 15, 1992, following the payment of $20 million by the Government of Kuwait and $30 million by the Government of Saudi Arabia to a special United Nations-controlled account, entitled UNSCR No.778 Escrow Account, the FRBNY was directed to transfer a corresponding amount of $50 million from the blocked account it holds to the United Nations-controlled account.Future transfers from the blocked FRBNY account will be made on a matching basis up to the $200 million for which the United States is potentially obligated pursuant to UNSCR No.778.6.Since the last report, one case filed against the Government of Iraq has gone to judgment.Consarc Corporation v.Iraqi Ministry of Industry and Minerals et al., No.90-2269 (D.D.C., filed December 29, 1992), arose out of a contract for the sale of furnaces by plaintiff to the Iraqi Ministry of Industry and Minerals (MIM), an Iraqi governmental entity.In connection with the contract, the Iraqi defendants opened an irrevocable letter of credit with an Iraqi bank in favor of Consarc, which was advised by Pittsburgh National Bank (PNB), with the Bank of New York (BONY) entering into a confirmed reimbursement agreement with the advising bank.Funds were set aside at BONY, in an account of the Iraqi bank, for reimbursement of BONY if PNB made a payment to Consarc on the letter of credit and sought reimbursement from BONY.Consarc received a down payment from the Iraqi MIM and manufactured the furnaces.No goods were shipped prior to imposition of sanctions on August 2, 1990, and the United States claimed that the funds on deposit in the Iraqi bank account at BONY were blocked, as well as the furnaces manufactured for the Iraqi Government or the proceeds of the sale of the furnaces to third parties.The district court ruled that the furnaces or their sales proceeds were properly blocked pursuant to the declaration of the national emergency and blocking of Iraqi Government property interests, but that, due to fraud on MIM's part in concluding the sales contract, the funds on deposit in an Iraqi bank account at BONY were not the property of the Government of Iraq, and ordered FAC to unblock these funds.FAC has noted its appeal of this ruling.7.FAC has issued a total of 337 specific licenses regarding transactions pertaining to Iraq or Iraqi assets since August 1990.Since the last report, 49 specific licenses have been issued.Licenses were issued for transactions such as the filing of legal actions involving Iraqi interests, for legal representation of Iraq, and the exportation to Iraq of donated medicine, medical supplies, and food intended for humanitarian relief purposes.To ensure compliance with the terms of the licenses which have been issued, stringent reporting requirements have been imposed that are closely monitored.Licensed accounts are regularly audited by FAC compliance personnel and deputized auditors from other regulatory agencies.FAC compliance personnel continue to work closely with both State and Federal bank regulatory and law enforcement agencies in conducting special audits of Iraqi accounts subject to the ISR.8.The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the 6-month period from August 2, 1992, through February 1, 1993, that are directly attributable to the exercise of powers and authorities conferred by the declaration of a national emergency with respect to Iraq are estimated at about $2 million, most of which represents wage and salary costs for Federal personnel.Personnel costs were largely centered in the Department of the Treasury (particularly in FAC, the U.S.Customs Service, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Enforcement, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for International Affairs, and the Office of the General Counsel), the Department of State (particularly the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs, the Bureau of Near East and South Asian Affairs, the Bureau of International Organizations, and the Office of the Legal Adviser), the Department of Transportation (particularly the U.S.Coast Guard), and the Department of Commerce (particularly in the Bureau of Export Administration and the Office of the General Counsel).9.The United States imposed economic sanctions on Iraq in response to Iraq's invasion and illegal occupation of Kuwait, a clear act of brutal aggression.The United States, together with the international community, is maintaining economic sanctions against Iraq because the Iraqi regime has failed to comply fully with United Nations Security Council resolutions, including those calling for the elimination of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, the inviolability of the Iraq-Kuwait boundary, the release of Kuwaiti and other third country nationals, compensation for victims of Iraqi aggression, long-term monitoring of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) capabilities, and the return of Kuwaiti assets stolen during its illegal occupation of Kuwait.The U.N.sanctions remain in place; the United States will continue to enforce those sanctions.The Saddam Hussein regime continued to violate basic human rights by repressing the Iraqi civilian population and depriving it of humanitarian assistance.The United Nations Security Council passed resolutions that permit Iraq to sell $1.6 billion of oil under U.N.auspices to fund the provision of food, medicine, and other humanitarian supplies to the people of Iraq.Under the U.N.resolutions, the equitable distribution within Iraq of this assistance would be supervised and monitored by the United Nations.The Iraqi regime continued to refuse to accept these resolutions and has thereby chosen to perpetuate the suffering of its civilian population.The regime of Saddam Hussein continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, as well as to regional peace and security.Because of Iraq's failure to comply fully with United Nations Security Council resolutions, the United States will therefore continue to apply economic sanctions to deter Iraq from threatening peace and stability in the region, and I will continue to report periodically to the Congress on significant developments, pursuant to 50 U.S.C.",clinton
"Thank you.I love these signs: Our children's future starts today.Health care for all.No guts, no glory: Stop gridlock.The Devil's in the details.That's right, too.We want real recovery.I love these signs, and I thank you all for being here today.Let me begin by saying how much I enjoyed flying down here with Congressman Clay and Congressman Gephardt and with Congressman Volkmer and Congresswoman Danner; they're here, too.They are part of the engine for change that you're going to see move through our Congress.I thank Bill Clay for hosting us in his district, and I want to congratulate him on the passage and this time the signing, not the veto, of the Family and Medical Leave Act.I want to say how glad I am to be back in St.Louis with your Governor, my longtime friend and early supporter.And I know that he will be a great success, and I'm going to do what I can to be his partner in Washington.I know from clear experience that we don't have all the answers, and I'll do what I can to see that we make as many decisions as possible out here in the Governor's offices where the rubber meets the road.And I thank him for being here.I want to recognize two of the groups that performed, the Fox High School Band and Harris-Stowe College Choir.Let me say a word if I might about our majority leader, Dick Gephardt.There is no way that I can convey to the people of St.Louis and Missouri how important he is to the Nation.But I can tell you this: I'm not sure we could do any of the things we have to do if it were not for his leadership.If you knew all the times that he had brought together the other Members of the House of Representatives on the Democratic side and told them they were going to have to cut spending as well as raise money, told them we were going to have to change our priorities, told them we were going to have to stick together to turn this country around, and been a force for moral leadership within the United States Congress, the heart of every person not just in his district but this whole State would swell with pride to know that you're represented by somebody like that.If you knew all the times that I heard him stick up in private for the men and women who build the cars and build the airplanes and brew the beer and provide the backbone of America, you would know that he doesn't just say things in public and then behave differently in private.He is the same everywhere.And I am very glad that he is my full partner in this crusade to change our country.You know, St.Louis is a special place for me.It's here where we ended the first of our wonderful bus trips across America and where we had a rally of about 40,000 people.It was the biggest crowd we'd had at that time in the campaign.And we started our second bus trip over in east St.Louis.And then we had the first Presidential debate here.So I think it's only fitting that I would come to my neighboring State in the heartland of America to start day one of America's new direction.I was in Missouri on the other side of the State on Labor Day, and I went to Harry Truman's home town.I guess in some ways the talk I gave to Congress last night was like one of President Truman's talks.Some of it was just off the top of my head and from the bottom of my heart.It was sort of plain spoken, and I couldn't figure out how else to say what I think is the plain truth about where we are.This is a country of enormous promise, of unlimited potential, of a great future burdened by big problems.I think everybody knows that.And we also know, I think, that some mistakes have been made in the course we have taken.The fundamental problems we have are because of big, sweeping changes in history: America being pushed into a global economy, all of us being subject to changes at a far more rapid rate than ever before.But we know that the responses we have taken have not worked.There are too many people who are unemployed.There are too many people who are underemployed.There ate too many people who have lost good jobs, that cannot get jobs at that income left.There are too many people with no health insurance and too many others terrified of losing it.There are too many people who don't have access to the education over a lifetime that they need to continually be retrained.There are too many places where we are not investing in the future.There are too many industries, like the aerospace industry in Missouri and throughout the country, that we know will produce a huge portion of the high-wage jobs of the future all over the world, and yet, they're dying on the vine here in America.These things don't make sense.What we have been doing has not worked.We need to take a new direction that will build a high-wage, high-growth, secure future where people can be educated, where there is affordable health care for all, and where Americans have a fair chance to compete and win.That's what this is all about.I want to repeat to you what I said to the Congress last night.I remember in 1981 when President Reagan said if you stacked 1,000-dollar bills on top of each other, our national debt would go 67 miles into the sky.If you did it today, it would go 267 miles into the sky.I say that not to blame him, not to blame my predecessor, not to blame anybody.Goodness knows, there's enough blame to go around, both parties and the Presidency and the Congress, but what good is it going to do us? Let us forget about blame and take responsibility for our future.Let's do it together.I don't care who gets the credit, I just want us to go forward.There are already people who are saying that we really can't make fundamental changes.There are people who are saying, Well, you can't bring the deficit down, or Well, nobody will hang in there and make these tough budget cuts the President's proposing, or Well, you can't really reform the health care system, even though we're paying more and getting less for ours than any country on the face of the Earth.I'm tired of all the nay-sayers.I think we can make some changes.But we need your help.We need your help in two ways: Number one, we need you to show up like this, and we need you to tell your Members of Congress that we will support you if you make the honest, tough, hard decisions.We know we didn't get into this mess overnight.We're not going to get out of it overnight.But we cannot keep doing the same old thing.The price of doing the same thing is higher than the price of change.The second thing you can do is to support your Members of Congress by demanding real political reform that will protect them in making courageous changes.Tell them you want a campaign finance reform bill that will limit the cost of congressional campaigns, limit the influence of special interests, and open this process to all people.Tell them you want something done to make sure all of the lobbyists in Washington have to register and report on their activities; twothirds of them don't.Tell them you support our bill to remove the tax deduction for lobbying activities.You are subsidizing interests that together undermine your future.Individually they've all got a good story to tell, but collectively they help to paralyze the political process.And you, at least, should not subsidize it with your tax dollars because you don't have comparable deductions.My fellow Americans, last night I tried to lay out to the Congress and to the American people a plan that will change the direction of this country and give us a genuine economic strategy, a plan to produce more jobs, higher income, deal with the health care crisis, provide a lifetime system of education, and reduce the national debt.We have to begin with the Government, and at the top with the President.So I have tried to set an example.I have cut the White House staff by 25 percent.That will be in my budget for the White House.I have cut the administrative costs of the executive branch in my budget 14 percent over the next 4 years, over and above the cuts in The White House, and we'll reduce employment, not by firing people but by attrition, by 100,000 over the next 4 years.That will save $9 billion.And yesterday the leaders of the House and the Senate announced that the Congress would follow our lead and cut their budgets by that much, which I think is good.There are 150 other specific cuts in this budget, including some that were very tough for me to recommend, some in programs that don't make any sense anymore.For example, do you remember when we had the Bicentennial celebration in 1976? There is still a Bicentennial Commission.Our Government's great at starting things and not very good at stopping things.So we eliminated a lot of things that ought to be stopped.The second thing we did was to reduce our investment in programs that have done a lot of good, but where the amount you're spending can't be justified anymore, including one that was really close to my heart.We recommended a reduction in the Federal subsidy to the Rural Electric Administration, something that serves a lot of people in my State and yours.But America is 100 percent electrified now, and we ought not to have the full subsidy continued from all of the rest of the people who get their electricity from someplace else.We recommended some unwarranted subsidies be eliminated because the need for the work is much less or nonexistent anymore.For example, we recommended a big cutback in a lot of programs related to the nuclear industry and the elimination of a nuclear research program that is inconsistent with our new energy future.We recommended some big changes in the environmental Superfund program: one, to make the polluters pay more and the taxpayers pay less and the second, to get the money freed up so that we can use the money to clean up pollution.It's all going to lawyer fees now, because people don't want anything to happen.We're going to try to make it work.Finally, I recommended&mdash;and this was difficult for me because I can't do anything as your President in the end without the support of the fine people in the Federal work force-but we recommended a freeze on Federal pay raises for a year and modest pay raises for the next 3, because that saves billions of dollars that we don't have to take out of the rest of the people in taxes to reduce the deficit.So there are 150 tough cuts.Now, let me say I've already heard some people on the other side of the aisle say, Well, he should have cut more.And my answer is: Show me where, but be specific.No hot air.Show me where, and be specific.And since I am here in Missouri, I think I will repeat that.Show me.And I say that not in the spirit of partisanship but in the spirit of genuine challenge.I know there is more that we can eliminate.I am honestly looking.I've just been there 4 weeks and a day, and I'm nowhere near through.And I want you to help me, and I want them to help me.Let me say also, the burdens in terms of taxes I think are imposed in a fair way.The rates of 98.9 percent of Americans will not be raised.Late in the last election, the New York Times carried a front-page story showing that 70 percent of the gains of the 1980's had been reaped by the top one percent of the people.This plan asked the top 1.2 percent of the people to have an income tax increase.This plan asked companies with incomes of over $10 million to match that income tax increase.This plan raises over 70 percent of the funds from people with incomes above $100,000.This plan raises no money from people with incomes below $30,000.And indeed, because we increased the refundable income tax credit, this plan, if it passes, will enable us to do something I would think every American would be proud of.For the first time ever, if this plan passes, we can say to the people of this country: Look, we are rewarding work and family.If you work full-time and you've got a kid in your house, you won't live in poverty because of the changes we're going to have in the tax system.People making $40,000, $50,000, in that range, will pay about $17 a month under this plan.But let me tell you, a lot of those people, many of whom are in this station today, may wind up not being out any more money for this reason: Just since the election, since I said we're going to have a tough plan to reduce this debt, long-term interest rates have gone down.If you take only the reduction in interest rates which have occurred from the election day until this day, for everybody who gets the benefit of those lower interest rates in a home mortgage, a car payment, consumer credit, you will make more in lower interest rates than you'll pay in the energy tax if we can show that we're serious about cutting spending and cutting this deficit.We've got to do it.One final thing which you'll also hear about from people who oppose this plan: I do propose to spend some more money, but not in the old way.Look at what we spend it for.We have reduced Government consumption.We have reduced inessential programs.But we increase spending on jobs: a jobs program to create a half a million jobs starting right now in building roads, repairing streets, fixing airports, cleaning up the environment with water systems and sewer systems; a million summer jobs for young people, if I could get the private sector to contribute to the 700,000 we're going to create in the Government.This program invests in opening the doors of college education to all people and giving them a chance to pay the loan back on favorable terms or to pay it back with service to our country.This plan will put 100,000 police officers on the streets of America over the next 4 years.This plan will give us a chance to invest in the new technologies that will create jobs for the people who have lost their jobs in the defense industries and in other big industries that have been downscaling.We have got to create some new jobs in this country, for goodness sakes.You can have all the other programs in the world, and unless we do it, we're going to be in trouble.And this plan will reduce the deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 5 years.And I ask you, I ask you to support it not just for you but for us, not just for narrow interest but for the national interest.I believe it will be good for virtually every American.Today as we speak, a lot of big corporate executives are endorsing this plan, even though their income tax bills will go up, their companies' bills will go up, because they want a healthy, strong, well-educated, vibrant America with an investment climate that's good, with stable interest rates, with a declining deficit, with a health care issue addressed, and with a country that can grow into the 21st century.So a lot of the people who are paying this bill are going to support it because they trust us.And let me say this: We need you to hold our feet to the fire.No raising taxes unless we cut spending.We've got to do this in a package, and we've got to do it together.I need your help.I'm delighted to see you here today.With your help we can make the spirit of St.Louis the spirit of America.Thank you, and God bless you all.",clinton
"Good morning.This week we celebrated the creation of 4 million new jobs in America since I became President on a platform to renew the American dream by restoring our economy, empowering individual Americans to compete and win in it, making Government work for ordinary citizens, and rebuilding our communities.Since we started our national economic strategy, our private sector is creating jobs nearly 8 times faster than it was 4 years ago.It hasn't been easy to make these changes.We had to make some tough decisions to put our economic house in order.We had to break the bad habits that led to mismanagement of our economy and the explosion of our deficit for more than a decade.And we had to break through all of the partisan barriers and political rhetoric that too often keeps us from doing the right thing for the American people here in Washington, DC.Today I want to talk with you about two other historic decisions that call on us to break through partisan barriers and political rhetoric again.For very soon, Congress will vote on both health care reform and the crime bill, two issues crucial to our mission of renewing the American dream.I want to talk to you about two young Americans whose stories are the best arguments I've heard for why we have to fix what's wrong with our health care system and make our country safer again for all Americans.One of those young people is Amanda Stewart from Keyes, Oklahoma.This week, I gave awards to four young people who have done heroic deeds or performed remarkable public service.Amanda was one of them.She was injured in a car wreck in 1990 and paralyzed from the chest down.This wonderful young lady could have given up on life.Instead of becoming bitter or defeated, she's devoted herself to educating other young people not to drink and drive, not to ride with people who do, and to always use seat belts.She's helping others to avoid what happened to her.I met Amanda's family.Her father is a hardworking farmer in western Oklahoma.She has a lovely mother and a wonderful younger sister.She hasn't had any significant medical costs since just after her accident 4 years ago.The Stewarts have been paying $3,400 a year for a limited health insurance policy with a high deductible.But recently they were told that this month their insurance premiums were going to be raised to $9,600 a year.Now, Amanda's father happens to be not only a farmer but a Republican.He's in a different party from me, and he made it clear to me that he doesn't want the National Government to give him anything.But he's got a family to raise, and he has no idea how he's going to keep paying for their health insurance.He said to me that if he couldn't take care of his family, as hard as he was working, something was wrong in this country.People like Amanda and her family are the reason we have to guarantee private, not Government, health insurance for every American, insurance that's always there.It's time to do what's right by those people.We're going in the wrong direction now.There are 5 million Americans just like Amanda's family who had insurance 5 years ago who don't have it today.Almost every one of them are working people and their children.We can do better, and we must.It's also time we do what's right for young people like James Darby, the 9-year-old boy from New Orleans who wrote me last April.He asked me to do something about the crime rate.He asked me to stop the killing, because he was afraid that someone might kill him.And just 9 days later, walking home from a Mother's Day picnic, little James Darby was shot in the head and killed.Well, 9 days ago, after 6 years of delay, a bipartisan committee of the Senate and the House of Representatives reconciled their differences on the smartest, toughest crime bill in the history of this country and sent the bill back to be voted on for final passage in both Houses of Congress.It took a lot of work.It's a bipartisan effort and has been every step of the way.Both Democrats and Republicans have voted for every part of it: three strikes and you're out and tougher punishments for other tough criminals; 100,000 new police officers on our streets&mdash;that's a 20 percent increase all across America; a ban on deadly assault weapons; a law that makes it illegal for minors to own and possess handguns; new prisons to keep hardened criminals in; and billions for new, effective prevention programs to give our young people something to say yes to, not just something to say no to.Nine days ago when the bill was sent to both Houses for final passage, I thought it would pass quickly and be sent to my desk for signing.But it still hasn't happened.Here's the one last hurdle: You see, before the House of Representatives can vote on a bill, it must agree on the rules for debate about the bill.There are 435 Members of the House, and they have to have some rules to limit debate.In shorthand, this is called the rule.The rule is purely a procedural matter, but it must be voted on before the final bill can pass.Unfortunately, the National Rifle Association, which is opposed to the assault weapons ban in the bill, and some other interests are trying to keep the crime bill from passing by defeating the rule.They're putting pressure on Members of Congress to kill the crime bill in a trick maneuver, because they know that once the bill itself gets to a vote, it will surely pass.You know, we had a tough fight with the NRA over the ban on assault weapons.And those of us who think they should be banned won by only two votes.But we won fair and square.No parliamentary trick should reverse that result and put the rest of that important crime bill in peril.Now, some Members of Congress honestly oppose the crime bill.They're against the assault weapons ban or they're against the capital punishment provisions of the bill or they're against spending money on prevention programs to give our kids a better future.Well, let them vote against the bill.Let them vote their conscience.But the NRA and the others should come out of the shadows.They ought to fight this bill on the merits.If they really want a shootout, we really ought to have it at broad daylight and high noon, not in the shadows of parliamentary maneuvering.No one should play any more political games with our Nation's safety.Nine days after 9-year-old James Darby wrote me saying he was worrying about his safety and pleading with his President to help, he was shot dead.Nine days ago, the House and the Senate got the crime bill.There are lots of other little James Darbys out there, and they've waited long enough.For Amanda Stewart and her fine family, for James Darby, for every American child and for all of their families and their futures, let's stop playing games with these two important issues.Let's get the job done.Thanks for listening.",clinton
"Hello.Thank you for waiting while I visited with one of your fellow citizens over there and her two children.I want to just get out and shake hands, so I won't make a long speech.But I would like to say, first, be supportive of the new candidate for the United States Senate, Congressman Bob Carr, and our new candidate for Governor, former Congressman Howard Wolpe.I'm glad to be here with Congressman Dingell and Congressman Conyers and Senator Levin and with your State officials and a lot of my friends in Michigan.I just want to make a comment or two.The lady to my left is Linda Clark.You may have read about her in the Michigan press, she and her two children.In 1993, her husband was killed in his business by five young people with previous criminal records.After he died, she received a $24,000 bill from the hospital for his medical care, even though she didn't have health insurance.Since then, she has become a crusader for health care for all Americans and for a sensible policy on crime and, specifically, a supporter of our crime and health care initiatives.I read her letter again coming in today, and I asked her and her children to come here and be with me today because in Washington, very often what we do gets all caught up in partisan political rhetoric and name-calling and stuff that is very hard for ordinary citizens to understand.And I just want to make two or three points here today.When I went to Washington as your President, I understood well that there would be forces there who would do anything, anything to fight change, to keep the established order of things, to stop us in our determination to give the American people their Government back again, to make it work for ordinary citizens, and to reawaken the American dream.But I want to ask you to look at the record, not the hype.When I became President, the deficit was going up, and the economy was going down.By the narrowest of margins, we passed our national economic strategy.It cut $255 billion worth of spending.It raised taxes on the wealthiest 1.2 percent of Americans, and all their money went to pay down the deficit.It gave a tax break to 15 million American working families.In Michigan that means 392,000 families got a tax cut; 41,000 got a tax increase.Ninety-one percent of the American small businesses were made eligible for a tax cut.We shrunk the Federal Government to its smallest size since Kennedy was President, produced 3 years of deficit reduction in a row for the first time since Harry Truman was President, and you've got 4.1 million new jobs in the United States since our administration took office.And since our administration took office, job growth in Michigan has been 3 1/2 times what it was before.It is no wonder that the other party would rather not talk about economics or crime or health care and instead are interested in other things and division and always saying no.We did not have a single, solitary vote, not one, for that economic strategy from the opposition party.And I have done everything I could to reach out to people without regard to their party and ask for a bipartisan consensus to govern America.You just remember that, folks, when Bob Carr is up here asking for your vote for the United States Senate.If it hadn't been for him, there would have been no deficit reduction, there would have been no economic recovery fueled by the first sensible economic plan we've had in more than 12 years.They want to go back; we're trying to go forward.And I appreciate your coming out here today saying you don't want to go back, you'd rather go forward, you'd rather create jobs, you'd rather grow the economy, you'd rather keep the American dream alive.Now, let me just make two other points.There's hardly a family in America that has not been affected by crime.And the Congress has passed the toughest, smartest crime bill in history in each House, but they haven't passed the same bill.There are things in that bill that are controversial.There are people who don't support the capital punishment provisions of the bill.There are people who don't support the fact that the bill bans 19 assault weapons, which are so often used by criminal gangs, even though it protects 650 hunting and sporting weapons from being banned.There are people who think we should not spend a lot of money on prevention programs to give our young people something to say yes to, instead of something to say no to.There are people who don't think it's important, but that crime bill gives 100,000 police to the streets of this country, a 20 percent increase.It makes our streets safer; it bans handgun ownership by minors; it has programs for safe schools; it has programs that will build more prisons and have three strikes and you're out for serious offenders and do more to help kids stay out of trouble.It is a good bill, and it should pass the United States Congress next week.We should stop fooling around with it.There are other families like Linda's family who deserve to have their streets safer and their futures better and brighter, and we ought to quit fooling around with it.And finally, let me say something about health care.You know, I get tickled at all these people who say that this health care bill is some big Government socialist scheme, that it's some horrible idea to take over a big part of our economy.Let me ask you something, folks.Here's a few questions, and I'd say the folks that aren't with us owe us some answers.Which country spends the most on health care? The United States.Which advanced country is the only one that doesn't provide health care coverage for everybody? The United States.Which is the only advanced country in the world where we're going in reverse, we're losing ground in health care coverage? The United States.Ten years ago, we had 88 percent of the people with insurance; now it's 83 percent.Today in America, there are 5 million, 5 million Americans, almost all of them working people and their children, who don't have insurance today who had it 5 years ago.Now, until we provide affordable private health insurance for all Americans, we are not going to be able to have a secure, stable family environment, work environment, offer people the chance to grow.What do they say about this health care plan? They say it's bad for small business.Well, let me ask you this&mdash;this is an interesting thing&mdash; why, if it's bad for small business, have 600,000 small businesses signed up to support our plan to require everybody to cover their employees and split the difference on the insurance premium? I'll tell you why, because most small businesses do provide health insurance to their employees, and they're getting ripped off today, they're paying too much for it.I met a farm family from western Oklahoma a couple of days ago when I gave their daughter an award.She's a young teenager who had a car wreck in 1990, paralyzed her from the chest down.She's spent the last 4 years trying to encourage people not to drink and drive, not to ride with drunk drivers, and always to put their seatbelts on&mdash;a marvelous girl.But the story this family told me was interesting: a Republican farmer from western Oklahoma, his wife, and their two beautiful daughters, one confined to a wheelchair.They've had almost no medical bills in the last 2 years.But they just got notice that in August, their health insurance premiums are going from $3,400 a year to $9,600 a year.And they are going to have to drop their health insurance.Now, this is not a partisan political issue.Anybody working that hard with two kids to educate, one of them with a serious illness&mdash;injury in the past, deserves affordable health insurance.The only State that has ever provided health care to all its citizens is Hawaii.For 20 years, employers and employees have had to provide health care.And you know what? Insurance premiums in Hawaii are 30 percent lower than they are in the rest of the country.We can do this.I am tired of people saying, we cannot do this, we cannot do that, we cannot do the other thing.The violent, extremist interests in this country that are trying to keep health care out of the reach of ordinary American working people are a disgrace to the American dream.Most of them have health care, and most of them have parents on Medicare.Why do they not want you to have the same thing that they have? Why? Why don't they want you to have what they can? Let them give up their health care and see how they like it.Now, folks, we're going to have to make some tough decisions here.I don't mind being a controversial figure.You didn't invite me to go to Washington to sit in the White House and warm the chair.We are changing this country.We are rebuilding the economy, we're taking on crime, we're taking on welfare reform, we're taking on health care, we're taking on the tough issues.But I cannot do it alone; you have to help.Support the Members of Congress.Tell them you want them to move on the crime bill.Tell them you want them to move on health care.Tell them a simple message: We are coming to the end of this century; we have got to keep the American dream alive.The only way to do it is to restore the economy, empower individuals to take advantage of it, and rebuild our communities and families.Let's make Government work for ordinary citizens again.That's what I'm fighting for.Thank you for being here to help me make the fight.God bless you.",clinton
"Thank you very much.I'm glad to be back in Michigan and glad to be back in Detroit.I'm glad to be on this stage with all these wonderful Democrats, and I thank them for the work they have done for your State and for your country.I also would like to say a special word of thanks to all the people of Michigan who have been so kind to me and to Hillary and to our administration, for the victory we won here in the primary in 1992 and in the general election, and since then, for all the work that has been done, including the wonderful host we had in Detroit in Mayor Archer, when we had the jobs conference here a few months ago.I thank you for that.Ladies and gentlemen, I ran for this job because I wanted to change this country.I was worried about the direction in which we were going.I thought the economy was going down, the deficit was going up, the country was coming apart, we were in danger of losing the American dream, and our Government wasn't working for ordinary people.I wanted to change all that.And after a year and a half, I can tell you that the change is well underway.A lot of people don't like it, and they've fought it every step of the way.When I try to unite people in Washington, there are always people there trying to divide us.When I try to talk in ordinary terms to ordinary people, there are always people there throwing around political hot air and divisive rhetoric.But I can tell you that we are moving forward.Since this administration took office, we have implemented a national economic strategy.We have launched a full-scale assault on crime.We have made a sweeping proposal on welfare reform.We have got bills to the floor of both Houses of Congress for the first time in the history of the United States to provide affordable health care to all Americans.And I want to point out, when I came to Michigan in 1992, people told me they wanted something done about this economy.When I offered our national economic plan to the Congress, I was told in a meeting by the congressional leaders of the other party that there would be no votes from the other party for the budget, no votes for the economic plan, that they would not help us to reverse 12 years of exploding deficits, declining investment, and a declining economy.And so, by the narrowest of margins, we passed that economic plan.And they said the sky would fall, the economy would collapse, the deficit would go up, jobs would be lost, the end of the world had come.Chicken Little was on the floor of the Senate and the House with an elephant pin on.We did ask 1.2 percent of the wealthiest people in this country to pay more so we could pay the deficit down, including 41,000 families in Michigan, one-tenth the number who got a tax cut.We made 90 percent of the small businesses in this State and this Nation eligible for tax reductions if they invested more to grow this economy.We made 20 million Americans immediately eligible for lower interest rates and better repayment terms on their college loans.And what was the result? We're shrinking the Federal Government to its smallest point since Kennedy was President.We've got 3 years of deficit reduction in a row coming for the first time since Truman was President.We have 4.1 million new jobs, more jobs in a year and a half in Michigan than in the previous 4 years.We have a big drop in the unemployment rate, the largest number of new businesses formed in any single year since World War II.I plead guilty: We did it.I just want you to remember this: In this United States Senate race, if it had not been for Congressman Carr, the plan would have gone down.We passed it by one vote.His opponent is against what we did.He is still proud of what we did.If you like where the economy is going, elect Bob Carr to the United States Senate.Now, let me say, we're fighting for some other things.We're going to try to pass a crime bill next week.We have to get it to a vote first.The crime bill has some controversial provisions.And a lot of Americans and some Members of Congress, in good conscience, don't agree with them.But it will put 100,000 police on the street.It will give the police a better chance to compete, because it eliminates assault weapons while protecting over 650 other hunting and sporting weapons from being fooled with, which I know is important.It says minors can't own or possess handguns unless they're under the supervision of an adult, which I think is very important.It provides funds for safe streets.It provides tougher penalties for repeat offenders, money for the States to build prisons, but money for prevention programs to give our children something to say yes to, as well as something to say no to.And we need to pass it because the security of our families and our communities and our workplaces and our schools demand it.You know, I met a woman from Michigan out at the airport.She came to see me with her two children.Her husband was murdered in his workplace last year.He was taken to the hospital and died.And after he died, she got a $24,000 bill from the emergency room.And because her husband was a small business person who couldn't afford to buy insurance, they didn't have any health insurance.So there she was, a widow with two little kids and a $24,000 bill.In 1943, Congressman Dingell's father introduced the first bill to provide affordable health care to all Americans.In 1945, '47, and '49, Harry Truman tried to do it.And now, here we are in 1994.We're the only country in the world with an advanced economy that doesn't provide health care to everybody.You've got the automobile industry in Michigan losing jobs and market share because they got $1,000 in every car in health care, and they're paying for the cost of people who won't even pay their own way.There are 5 million working people in America, almost all of them working people and their children, who had health insurance 5 years ago who don't have it today.We're going in reverse.We have a clear example in the State of Hawaii, where for 20 years the employers and employees have all had to buy health insurance, where small businesses have premiums that are 30 percent below the national average.People are healthier, they're doing better, and the small business community is doing better.And we are determined to see that we do not walk away from this.Let me tell you, when we started this health care debate, there were two dozen Senators from the other party on a bill that would provide health care to all Americans.Today, there are zero there.Every time we have moved to them, they have run the other way.It is time to stop playing politics with the health care of the people of the United States of America.Now, I knew we had to make some changes in our plan, and we did.We made it less bureaucratic, more voluntary, gave bigger breaks to small business, and we phase it in over a longer period of time.That's what the bills now before Congress do.But the issue is this: Are we going to keep spending more than everybody else and getting less for it, or are we going to continue to let more and more money go to insurance companies and bureaucracies instead of to keep people healthy, or are we going to run the risk of imperiling this fabulous recovery in the auto industry and this recovery in the economy, or are we going to keep punishing the small business people who do provide health insurance? Or are we going to do what's right for the American people? That is the issue.It should not be a partisan political issue.In this election year we ought to forget about the election and remember the people who elected us in the first place and take care of their needs.And let me make one final remark to you about my friend, your nominee for Governor.For 12 years I had the honor of being the Governor of my State.It was an incredible experience.And I learned a few things about doing it.And I'll tell you, if you want to succeed over the long run, you have to recognize, number one, a lot of these problems cannot be solved in Washington.I can put in place good economic policies, good health care policies, good education policies, good anticrime policies, but still, in the statehouses and in the city halls, the shape of the future will be determined by the quality of the people who are elected.The President cannot do it; the Congress cannot do it.It matters.The second thing I want to tell you is Governors understand that partisan politics doesn't have much to do with whether kids get educated, jobs get created, streets are safer, if you're doing your job right.You need someone who can unify people; someone who believes that we don't have a person to waste, that we cannot afford to be divided; someone who will tell you hard truths but tell you hard truths in a way that will bring us together, not tear us apart; and you also need someone with an eye on the future.This man I know well.He was the first member of your delegation to endorse my candidacy.I hope that doesn't hurt him here this year.And I can tell you, he will be a Governor you can be proud of.He will unite the people of this State, not divide them.And he will always be thinking about the future.We are living in a time when the average person will change jobs seven times in a lifetime.We cannot afford people to ever, ever, ever forget about the fact that politics can never be about what works in the moment.We have to be thinking about tomorrow.So I say to you: I want you to elect him Governor.I want you to elect Bob Carr Senator.I want you to return these Members of the House delegation, without whom this economic recovery would not be underway.Every one of them will be attacked by their Republican opponents as being the same old tax-and-spend, blah, blah, blah, blah.We have an economic strategy.It includes fair taxation, but we're bringing the deficit down, investing in education and training, building the economy, and looking toward the future.I think that's what the American people want us to do.If they know what the record is, these people will all be returned.You make sure they know.Thank you, and God bless you.",clinton
"Thank you.Thank you very much, Senator Graham.Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you'll forgive me.I have my annual August ragweed voice.If you don't have allergies and you can't tell whether ragweed has come out in Washington, DC, you just wait for me to get my sort of, you know, raspy&mdash;surely there's a role for me in the movies when I talk like this.I could be the guy that delivers the bad news, and that wouldn't be any role change I would have to take.I thank the incumbent Senators who are here, Senator Graham and the others who have worked so hard.I also want to congratulate the nominees who are here.We have an exceptionally outstanding group of people: Bob Carr, Alan Wheat, Tom Andrews, Sam Coppersmith, Jim Cooper, all from the House of Representatives, and former Congressman Jim Jontz, all of whom have real records of fighting for the interests of ordinary Americans in trying to build this country and all of whom have a real chance to be elected to the United States Senate if we work hard for them.Joel Hyatt from Ohio is not here tonight, but he and I were in law school together.He's younger than I am.Most people are these days.Joel Hyatt began a program when we were in law school for undergraduates to tutor innercity kids and then went on to become famous by making legal representation available to ordinary middle class folks.The program he started when we were in law school is still operating there, a real tribute to his capacity to innovate.Richard Fisher from Texas is also not here tonight, but he is another longtime friend of mine who worked with me in the Democratic Leadership Council and tried to bring new ideas into the party.And believe it or not, in Texas, no matter how much the Republicans crow, he's got an excellent chance to win there, and we're going to work hard for him.The attorney general of Delaware is here, Charles Oberly, who&mdash;now, that's the job I used to have.That's the best job I ever had.I don't know why he wants to be in the Senate.When you're attorney general, you don't have to hire people or fire them, except your own staff; you don't have to raise taxes or cut spending; and when you do things that are unpopular, you can blame it on the Constitution.And we were together in Delaware a few months ago.It was apparent to me, not only from what I read in the Delaware papers but from what I saw of him on the stump and the reaction of the people of Delaware, that he had an excellent chance to win that race.I also want to note the presence here of Jack Mudd from Montana who, like me, was a law professor.But unlike me, he became the youngest law school dean in America.And it hasn't seemed to do him much harm; he's here running for the Senate.Everybody I know in Montana believes that he has a great chance to win.That State went Democratic in the last election.And it's a very tightly fought State, a very closely contested one, but I think he's got an excellent chance to win.I'd like to mention three other folks who are here, two from the State legislature, Linda Kushner of Rhode Island and Ken Harper of Mississippi, and Pat Shea of Utah who used to be counsel for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a committee that I worked for when I was trying to work myself through college here in the 1960's.I have had the occasion to meet and be with all three of them over the years, and I highly recommend them to all of you.Most of you have heard me speak before.The last thing you need to hear is me give another speech, except when I'm hoarse.But I want to make a couple of points.I ran for President as an underdog, as a challenger.I was buried two or three times before the final vote came in.One of the things that I know is that you can't win a race unless you want to win for something bigger than yourself and that if you do want to win for something bigger than yourself, you have always got a chance to win.I know that you can't win in a tough time if you don't fight, but if you do fight, you're always in the race.And I know that the American people are basically ambivalent about most things in their politics today.I think it is largely because of the time in which we live.And I think it is an enormous opportunity for us to show conviction and direction.And I might say&mdash;I don't want to single out just one of the Senators here, but I am very, very proud of the conviction, direction, and strength that Chuck Robb is showing in his heroic fight to be reelected to the United States Senate from Virginia.And I want to begin with a story from one of his debates, and then I'll end with another one to illustrate what this election is all about.When I entered the race for President in late 1991, when President Bush was at 70 percent approval in the polls and most people, aside from my mother, thought I had lost my mind, I did it because I was very worried that this National Government had become more about words than deeds and that we had become addicted to seeing the Presidents always worried about how they were positioned, rather than what they were doing, and that we were moving toward the 21st century at a breathtaking pace with the economy going down, the deficit going up, the middle class being squeezed&mdash;genuinely in danger of losing our position of energy and leadership and direction in the world.It seemed to me that to keep the American dream alive, we had to do some simple things that were not being done.We had to restore the economy, empower individuals to compete and win in it, rebuild our communities and support our families, and make Government work for ordinary people again.When I started running for President&mdash;I was looking out there&mdash;Jerry McEntee came out for me fairly early, and a lot of people thought he had lost his mind, because some people said, Well, Clinton's not enough of a Democrat; he's always working with Republicans and trying to get things done.I plead guilty: I did that.I was even popular with the previous administration until I filed.But I want to tell you what the problem is and why these races are so important with two stories.I'll begin and end with one.The one I'll begin with was from Senator Robb's first debate on the Larry King show.The other three guys were just pounding, you know, and Marshall Coleman looked at him and said, You come from conservative Virginia, and you pretend to be a conservative, but you are one of the top 10 Democrats supporting Bill Clinton in the United States Senate.Chuck Robb looked at Marshall Coleman and smiled, and he said, Yep, and I was one of the top 10 Democrats supporting George Bush in the United States Senate.I do not believe the purpose of politics is to destroy the President, and I've finally got somebody who is trying to get the deficit down instead of just talk about it, and so I supported him.And I never will forget that.Now, what's that got to do with anything? You have to decide what the purpose of your public life is.Is it to do things that genuinely respond to the needs of people, or is it to posture? You remember one of the Republican House Members that's leaving the House, Fred Grandy, said the other day that his colleagues had been told not to work with us on health care.Senator Dole was quoted a few weeks ago as saying, well, he understood that some of the Republican Senators wanted to work with us on health care and work something out, but I've got a party to think of.Now, all I know is, when we showed up here, the deficit was going up and the economy was going down.And with no help from them, we passed an economic program that cut spending by $255 billion, cut taxes on 15 million working Americans, made 90 percent of the small businesses eligible for tax cuts, raised taxes on 1.2 percent of the people but devoted all the money to paying the deficit down, made 20 million Americans eligible to refinance their college loans at a lower interest rate.And not a one of them helped us.They said the sky would fall.They said the deficit would go up and the economy would go down.I never heard so much Chicken Little talk in my life as we heard a year ago this month.And they all talked about how we were the tax-and-spend party and they were against big government.You just remember this: The Democrats alone, with not a single, solitary vote from the opposition party, adopted a budget which will shrink the Federal Government to fewer than 2 million people for the first time since John Kennedy was President&mdash;something they say they're for but couldn't or wouldn't do&mdash;that will give us 3 years of deficit reduction in a row for the first time since Harry Truman was President&mdash;something they said they were for but couldn't or wouldn't do&mdash;and has produced 4.1 million new jobs in 18 months.Now, that's why I want these people to win, not because I am an abject partisan&mdash;my whole record shows that I'm always willing to work with people from the other side&mdash;but because the voters have to send a message to all of us that they expect problems to be solved.If the message they send is they'd rather have hot air than firm action to advance the cause of middle class people, then the Democrats will start behaving the same way.We must keep our eyes on doing things, and then we need to stand up and do them.Today I had the pleasure of presenting the Presidential Medal of Freedom to nine distinguished Americans, one of whom was Barbara Jordan from Texas, and I wish she were here tonight.She said, I just don't get it.You can just imagine.She said, The Democrats have a wonderful record; what they need is to fight for it.Barbara Jordan said that.We need this crime bill.It's being held up by people who know if it comes to a vote, it'll pass overwhelmingly.So they think they can beat it on a technicality&mdash;and the American people won't understand it&mdash;called a rule.It's the House equivalent of the filibuster: Beat it, but act like you're not.The Democrats have put together a bill the Republicans said they were for for 6 years but couldn't produce, that every one of us can be proud of: 100,000 more police, a 20 percent increase; tougher penalties; a ban on assault weapons; a ban on ownership of handguns by children; and billions of dollars in prevention programs to give our kids something to say yes to.We cannot walk away from it.In the health care debate, we have on the floor of both Houses of Congress, for the first time in the history of the Republic, bills that would provide health care to all Americans&mdash; never been done before, never even got on the floor before.And yes, there's a lot of controversy about it.There's a lot of information and a lot of misinformation, some genuine difference of opinion.But we do know some things about which there is no dispute.And the burden should be, therefore, on those who have no plan.We know we spend more on health care than anybody else, 40 percent more of our income.We know that even though we do that, we're the only country in the world with an advanced economy that hasn't figured out how to cover everybody.We know that we're the only country going in reverse.There are 5 million Americans today, almost all of them working Americans and their children, who don't have insurance who did have insurance just 5 years ago.That's not happening anywhere else in the world, only here.So by what reasoning is it that we say, This is good that we spend 40 percent more than anybody else, do less? We're the only ones losing ground, and we spend billions and billions on paperwork, bureaucracy, and administrative costs that no one else spends.We say we are a pragmatic people.But we know that in Hawaii, small business insurance rates are 30 percent lower than the rest of the country because everybody's covered and everybody bears some of the burden.Should we try something else? I'm willing to try something else for 4 or 5 years.I think it ought to be phased in.I think we ought to be careful.I think we ought to give the market a chance to work.But I think we also should not walk away from what we know works.The main thing I want to tell you is this: When we enter this debate, what I hope it will be about is the health care of the American people, their pocketbooks, the pocketbook of the Federal Government, the quality of care, the ability to choose your doctors, and the ability to meet the legitimate needs of middle class working people, and not politics.Last week&mdash;and this is the story I want to end with&mdash;last week I had the honor of doing something that Presidents have done for 44 years: that is to present awards every year, with the Attorney General, to four young Americans who have either shown great heroism or great public service.One of the public service winners was a young woman from Keyes, Oklahoma, who was paralyzed in 1990 from the chest down in a car accident and since then has spent her time trying to organize children not to drink and drive, not to ride with people who drink and drive, and always to wear their seatbelts.In other words, instead of being bitter, this beautiful child is trying to make sure other people don't have the experience she did.And so there I was, just totally captivated with this young woman and her little sister and her fine father and mother.And her daddy was a farmer from Keyes, Oklahoma, way out in western Oklahoma.And we just got to talking about health care.And he said, You know, I was paying $3,400 a year for a limited policy.And my daughter's bills, they were all over 2 years ago.We hadn't had any bills in 2 years.But they told me I had used up my wellness quotient, and my premium is going to $9,600 in 2 weeks.So in 2 weeks, we'll be out of insurance.And he said&mdash;he tickled me&mdash;he said, It's not a political deal.He said, I'm a Republican, Mr.President.But he said, If somebody's working as hard as I'm working and can't even have health insurance for their kids, something is wrong somewhere.And so as we begin this debate, there are legitimate differences of approach.I welcome them.Nobody's smart enough to know everything about this issue.But let us remember that farmer from Keyes, Oklahoma, and his fine wife and his two beautiful daughters and ask ourselves, how will he send them to college if he can't even pay their health insurance? And when we go into these fall elections, let us proudly say, Yes, we're Democrats.And when they attack us for being tax-and-spend, say, We cut taxes on 10 times as many people as we raised them on.You guys had a bigger Government than we're having.We're just trying to solve the problems of the people of the country.We put 100,000 police on the street without a tax increase, by shrinking the Federal bureaucracy.We can win the partisan debates if we'll fight.But the main thing we need to do is to remember that this is a difficult and confusing time for our people.The cold war is over.We're moving to a new era.It has not been defined.Every time this happens, the American people become vulnerable.At the end of World War I, we were vulnerable to the first Red scare and to the Ku Klux Klan.At the end of World War II, the same thing happened all over again.The only difference was Harry Truman gladly let his popularity drop from 80 percent to 36 percent to keep our eye on the ball, to rebuild the country and recapture the rest of the world.And in the end, the American people worked through their confusion and came back to their better nature.And they will now if we can make this election about them, not about an argument between Republicans and Democrats, not about all these rhetorical hard balls.Let's just stand up and defend what we've done, defend what we believe in, and fight for the American people.If we do, the crowd we've got in this room can win these elections in November.Thank you, and God bless you.",clinton
"Thank you very much, Secretary Rubin and Ambassador Kantor.Ladies and gentlemen, we wanted to be here today to make the clearest public case we can for the proposal which has been developed by the administration and the bipartisan leadership in Congress for dealing with the present situation.We have worked hard with an extraordinary group of people who have joined forces because all of us realize how important this proposal is, not only to the people of Mexico but also to the United States and to our workers.We are acting to support the Mexican economy and to protect and promote the interests of the American people.As Ambassador Kantor said, and as all of you know very well, we live in an increasingly global economy in which people, products, ideas, and money travel across national borders with lightning speed.We've worked hard to help our workers take advantage of that economy by getting our own economic house in order, by expanding opportunities for education and training, and by expanding the frontiers of trade, by doing what we could to make sure there was more free and fair trade for Americans.And we know, and all of you know, that those efforts are creating high wage jobs for our people that would otherwise not be there.Our goal, our vision must be to create a global economy of democracies with free market, not government-run, economies; democracies that practice free and fair trade, that give themselves a chance to develop and become more prosperous, while giving our own people the opportunity they deserve to reap the benefits of highquality, high-productivity American labor, in terms of more jobs and higher incomes.We have pursued this goal with vision and with discipline, through NAFTA, through the Summit of the Americas, through a number of other international endeavors like GATT and the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation group.But we have pursued it especially here in our own hemisphere, where we are blessed to see every nation but one governed in a democratic fashion and a genuine commitment to free market economics and to more open trade.We have to know that the future on this path is plainly the right one, but as with any path, it cannot be free of difficulties.We have to make decisions based on a determined devotion to the idea of what we are pursuing over the long run.We know that, given the volatility of the economic situation in the globe now, there can be developments that for the movement are beyond the control of any of our trading partners, themselves developing nations, which could threaten this vision and threaten the interests of the American people.Mexico's present financial difficulty is a very good case in point.Of course, it's a danger to Mexico, but as has already been said, it is plainly also a danger to the economic future of the United States.NAFTA helped us to dramatically increase our exports of goods and services.It helped us to create more than 100,000 jobs here at home through increased exports to Mexico.But over the long run, it means even more.It means even more opportunities with Mexico.It means the integration of the rest of Latin America and the Caribbean into an enormous basket of opportunities for us in the future.And we cannot&mdash;we cannot let this momentary difficulty cause us to go backward now.That's why, together with the congressional leadership, I am working so hard to urge Congress to pass an important and necessary package to back private sector loans to Mexico with a United States Government guarantee.Let me say, I am very gratified by the leadership shown in the Congress on both sides of the aisle.By helping to put Mexico back on track, this package will support American exports, secure our jobs, help us to better protect our borders and to safeguard democracy and economic stability in our hemisphere, because America and American workers are more secure when we support a strong and growing market for our exports, because America and American workers are more secure when we help the Mexican people to see the prospect of decent jobs and a secure future at home through a commitment to free-market economics, political democracy, and growing over the long term, and because we're more secure when more and more other countries also enjoy the benefits of democracy and economic opportunity, and perhaps most important over the long run, because we are more secure if we help Mexico to remain a strong and stable model for economic development around our hemisphere and throughout the world.If we fail to act, the crisis of confidence in Mexico's economy could spread to other emerging countries in Latin America and in Asia, the kinds of markets that buy our goods and services today and that will buy far more of them in the future.Developing these markets is plainly in the interests of the American people.We must act to make sure that we maintain the kind of opportunities now being seized by the Secretary of Commerce and the delegation of American business leaders who have had such a successful trip to India.If you take Mexico, just consider the extraordinary progress made in recent years.Mexico erased a budget deficit that once equalled 15 percent of its gross domestic product.It slashed inflation from 145 percent a year to single digits.It sold off inefficient state enterprises, dramatically reduced its foreign debt, opened virtually every market to global competition.This is proof that the Mexican Government and the Mexican people are willing to make decisions that are good for the long run; even if it entails some short-term sacrifice for them, they know where their future prosperity and opportunity lie.Now Mexico, of course, will have to demonstrate even greater discipline to work itself out of the current crisis.Let me say, though, it's important that we understand what's happened.And the Secretary of Treasury and I and a lot of others spent a lot of time trying to make sure we understood exactly what had happened before we recommended a course of action.It is clear that this crisis came about because Mexico relied too heavily upon short-term foreign loans to pay for the huge upsurge in its imports from the United States and from other countries.A large amount of those debts came due at a time when, because of the nature of the debts, it caused a serious cash flow problem for Mexico, much like a family that expects to pay for a new home with the proceeds from the sale of its old house only to have the sale fall through.Now, together with the leadership of both Houses, our administration has forged a plan that makes available United States Government guarantees to secure private sector loans to Mexico.The leadership in Congress from both sides of the aisle and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board developed this plan with us.It is something we did together because we knew it was important, important enough to the strategic interest of the United States to do it in lockstep and to urge everyone without regard to party or region of the country or short-term interests to take the long view what is good for America and our working people.We all agree that something had to be done.Now, these guarantees, it's important to note, are not foreign aid.They are not a gift.They are not a bailout.They are not United States Government loans.They will not affect our current budget situation.Rather they are the equivalent of cosigning a note, a note that Mexico can use to borrow money on its own account.And because the guarantees are clearly not entirely risk-free to the United States, Mexico will make an advanced payment to us, like an insurance premium.No guarantees will be issued until we are satisfied that Mexico can provide the assured means of repayment.As soon as the situation in Mexico is fully stabilized, we expect Mexico to start borrowing once again from the private markets without United States Government guarantees.The U.S.has extended loans and loan guarantees many, many times before to many different countries.In fact, we've had a loan mechanism in place with Mexico since 1941.And Mexico has always made good on its obligations.Now, there will be tough conditions here to make sure that any private money loaned to Mexico on the basis of our guarantees is well and wisely used.Our aim in imposing the conditions, I want to make clear, is not to micromanage Mexico's economy or to infringe in any way on Mexico's sovereignty but simply to act responsibly and effectively so that we can help to get Mexico's economic house back in order.I know some say we should not get involved.They say America has enough trouble at home to worry about what's going on somewhere else.There are others who may want to get involved in too much detail to go beyond what the present situation demands or what is appropriate.But we must see this for what it is.This is not simply a financial problem for Mexico; this is an American challenge.Mexico is our third largest trading partner already.The livelihoods of thousands and thousands of our workers depend upon continued strong export growth to Mexico.That's why we must reach out and not retreat.With the bipartisan leadership of Congress, I am asking the new Congress to cast a vote, therefore, for the loan guarantee program as a vote for America's workers and America's future.It is vital to our interests.It is vital to our ability to shape the kind of world that I think we all know we have to have.No path to the future&mdash;let me say again&mdash; in a time when many decisions are beyond the immediate control of any national government, much less that of a developing nation, no path to the future can be free of difficulty.Not every stone in a long road can be seen from the first step.But if we are on the right path, then we must do this.Our interests demand it.Our values support it, and it is good for our future.Let me say again that the coalition of forces supporting this measure is significant; it may be historic.The new Republican leaders in Congress, the leadership of the Democratic Party in Congress, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, why are they doing this? And I might say, I was immediately impressed by how quickly every person I called about this said, Clearly, we have to act.They instinctively knew the stakes.Now in the public debate questions should be properly asked and properly answered.But let us not forget what the issue is.Let us not read too little into this moment or try to load it up with too many conditions unrelated to the moment.The time is now to act.It is in our interest.It is imperative to our future.I hope all of you will do what you can to take that message to the Congress and to the American people.Thank you very much.",clinton
"Thank you very much, Mr.Secretary.After that kind introduction I'm loath to say what I was about to say, which is I'm afraid the headline on this story will be Reich comes out for playing hard.I want to thank the steelworkers and the senior citizens groups and all the others who were mentioned by Secretary Reich.I'd like to especially thank someone who is not here, my longtime friend J.J.Pickle, who retired from the Congress and who left this as his last legacy in a long career of helping people with their own lives.I'd like to thank another longtime friend of mine who is still here&mdash;that's maybe a disability in this town, but Marty Slate has done a wonderful job at the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.I'll never forget the first time Hillary told me about Marty Slate.She said, That's the smartest guy I ever met in my life.He'll find a way to solve any kind of problem.And you have done a fine job, and we're grateful to you.And I'd like to thank someone whose name I don't know and I've been trying to find out before this moment.I'd like to thank the person in the Richmond debate in 1992 who asked President Bush and Ross Perot and Bill Clinton about the problems of underfunded pensions and first got my attention on this issue.I wish I don't know who that person was, but I am deeply indebted, and now so are several million other Americans, to that person for bringing this issue personally to me in a very direct way.Two years ago from tomorrow, I became President, with a commitment to try to restore the American dream for all Americans and to make sure that we enter the next century as the strongest country in the world, a force for peace and freedom and democracy, but most important of all, as one which in a very different world would keep the American dream alive for all of our people.When I signed the Retirement Protection Act into law last month, it was almost completely unnoticed because at the end of the year it had to go through in the comprehensive legislation that involved the passage of the GATT trade agreement.And we wanted to do this today because this act was so profoundly important to so many millions of Americans and it says a lot about what we are trying to do here in Washington.This is part of a new economic policy designed to help the American people stay ahead in a world economy that is changing so rapidly that, while it offers vast new benefits to people, it also is very frightening to a lot of people and causes too much insecurity and unsettling for people who have worked hard and done the right things all their lives.It gives the American taxpayers a more effective, more efficient, and more disciplined Government.And this bill furthers what I have called my own contract with America, the New Covenant.It says that people who act responsibly should be rewarded.The Retirement Protection Act says that people deserve a pension system that they rely on.They deserve employers who take actions to be worthy of their own trust and the labor that they give them, year-in and year-out.They deserve a Government that will protect them and stand by them, a Government that is their partner.It says to employers that they can no longer gamble with the retirement savings of their own employees, allowing pension plans to become dangerously underfunded, expecting taxpayers to bail them out.It means that responsible businesses with well-funded plans will no longer have to carry an unfair share of the burden of the insurance costs for businesses who do not do the same.As a result of the new law, the funding level of large, underfunded pension plans will be increased dramatically so that the benefits can be paid as they were promised.The National Pension Insurance System will remain secure.Employees will get better information warning them when their plans could be at risk.In stabilizing the Federal insurance system, we used the power of Government to avert a potential crisis, protecting millions of retirees, corporate pension plans, and the taxpayers from huge potential losses.Today we can be grateful that the security of our pensions are strong and growing stronger, thanks to the Retirement Protection Act and the work of all of you in this room who did so much to make it happen.Thank you very, very much.",clinton
"Good morning, everyone.I'm delighted to be joined this morning by Senator Nickles, Senator Ford, Senator Lieberman, Senator Grassley, and Senator Glenn and by Congressman Armey, Congressman Fazio, Congressman Shays, Congressman Gutknecht, and also by former Congressman Dick Swett and former Speaker Foley, who were instrumental in supporting this legislation in the previous session of the Congress where it passed the House but not the Senate.Let me say that I am extremely pleased, and I think the American people are extremely pleased, that we are beginning the new year with a reform that requires Congress to live under the laws it imposes on the American people.I'm encouraged that we've begun this year with the White House and Congress, with Republicans and Democrats working together on a reform that has long been needed.Most Americans are actually surprised when they learn that some of our most basic laws don't apply to Congress and their staffs.This legislation ensures that we'll change that.It guarantees that the cafeteria workers and the police who work in Congress and who help millions of tourists every year will have the same rights as all Americans do to a safe environment, to collective bargaining, to civil rights protection.It does something else that's very important.Over the years, Washington has too often isolated itself from the everyday experience of ordinary Americans.It's become remote from the consequences of the actions Congress takes.I want to end this.Congress clearly wants to end this.Now when Congress passes a law, it will immediately know the consequences of the law if it affects private employers as well.This will help us reconnect Government to the lives of ordinary Americans.That's why I supported this change when I ran for President and why I have supported it as President.It will help us to do what we must do to continue to fight to bring a reality check to Washington.That's why I worked to cut the White House staff, to eliminate the executive dining rooms, to cut back the widespread use of Government limousines, to reduce the deficit, to shrink the Federal bureaucracy to its smallest size in 30 years.I'll admit that last year when this reform didn't pass I was disappointed.But I am very happy today.I want to thank all the Senators who are here, Senators Lieberman, Glenn, and Grassley, Senator Nickles, for what they all did.I thank Congressman Shays and Congressman Hoyer, who is not here, and the other Members of the House for all the work that they did.And again I say, I thank those who worked on this last year when it passed the House.Already this year, Congress has enacted other important reforms, like reducing the staff and the number of committees.I want to congratulate the Members of Congress on these steps and, in particular, Majority Leader Dole and Speaker Gingrich, the Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle, and the House Democratic leader, Dick Gephardt.These changes I hope are the beginning of something that will continue for the next several years.We must use this impetus to make much deeper changes in the culture of Washington that has too often disconnected it from ordinary Americans.The American people, for example, know that lobbyists frequently get access to Congress they can never hope to get.They know the voices of special interests still sometimes ring too loud.They know too much of what goes on here goes on behind closed doors.Congress should ban the practice of gifts and meals and travels and entertainment from lobbyists.It should pass the strongest possible version of the line-item veto, lobby disclosure reform, and real comprehensive campaign finance reform.I want to discuss these matters in detail tomorrow evening, but this is a job we must finish.This bill demonstrates the common resolve of people here that those in power should not lose touch with those who sent them here.Now we've got to go on.We must make this system more open, more fair, and less elitist.That's the goal we all share.I look forward to working with all of the Members here and all the Members of the Congress in both parties to achieve that goal.Now I want to get on with signing the bill.",clinton

"On behalf of the American people, it is my honor to congratulate Muslims around the world on the occasion of the Eid Al-Fitr.Whether native-born or immigrants from Africa, the Middle East, Asia, or Europe, Muslims now represent an increasingly important element in the tapestry of American society.Because of the growth of Islam in our country, American citizens of all faiths are coming to appreciate the significance of Ramadan as Muslims fast, pray, and rededicate themselves to the teachings of the Qur'an.United in faith, America's Muslims are also united in their commitment to building a society rich in diversity and grounded in mutual respect.I believe America is made stronger by the core values of Islam&mdash;commitment to family, compassion for the disadvantaged, and respect for difference.There is special significance this year as the three Abrahamic faiths all celebrate holidays in the span of the same week.As Jews celebrate Hanukkah, Christians celebrate Christmas, and now Muslims celebrate Eid Al-Fitr.The Qur'an, the Bible, and the Torah all call on believers to love one's neighbors and to welcome strangers.The Qur'an tells us that we are all People of the Book and that we share a common humanity and dignity.As the appearance of the new moon brings to a close this holy month, we all pray that it will usher in a year of reconciliation and peace.The First Lady and I wish all Muslims a blessed celebration of the Eid Al-Fitr and peace, health, and prosperity in the years ahead.Eid mubarak.",clinton
"Perhaps no other American lawyer has had more impact on the current meaning and content of the U.S.Constitution.As the leading attorney for the N.A.A.C.P.Legal Defense and Education Fund, Justice Marshall's twenty-nine victories before the U.S.Supreme Court breathed life into the text of the Fourteenth Amendment and guaranteed all Americans equality and liberty in their individual choices concerning voting, housing, education, and travel.As an appeals court judge, the Solicitor General of the United States and, finally, Supreme Court Justice, he worked tirelessly to expand and protect his vision of justice for America.As our Nation begins to chart its course for the next century, it is fitting that we pause to honor and remember the courageous, purposeful life of Thurgood Marshall.As a mark of respect for the memory of Thurgood Marshall, former Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, I hereby order by the authority vested in me as President of the United States of America by section 175 of title 36 of the United States Code, that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff upon all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and Possessions until his interment.",clinton
"At the same time, I ask the citizens of America to join me in renewing our commitment to the American ideals of fellowship and hope.The obligation of a President is more than the fulfillment of a set of constitutional duties.The President must carry the mantle of hope and optimism in the battle against fear and despair.I ask that every American help as we attempt, in the words of the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope and transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood.We must always remember that the essence of our democracy is the recognition that we are united in a common purpose, working toward a common good.In renewing our commitment to fellowship throughout our great Nation, we recall the spirit of Thomas Jefferson, who said on the occasion of his first inaugural address, Let us, then, fellow citizens, unite with one heart and one mind.",clinton
"Let me, first of all, thank Prime Minister Blair, First Minister Trimble, Deputy First Minister Mallon, for their strong leadership and their kind and generous remarks today.I am delighted to be with them, Cherie, Mrs.Trimble, my longtime friend John Hume; Senator George Mitchell, who is here; the Members of the Parliament in Northern Ireland; the Members of the United States Congress and the American delegation over here to my right.I thank Chris Gibson of the Civic Forum and many others who helped to make this day possible.Hillary, Chelsea, and I are delighted to be back in Northern Ireland, and here.I also can't help noting that this magnificent new arena is new since I was last here in '98&mdash; a new team, a new sport, a new facility, a new Northern Ireland.I want to thank the Belfast Giants for letting us use the arena tonight.I understand they don't treat their opponents as kindly as me, and I thank them for that.Well, I'm used to absorbing blows, but that's about the only qualification I have.He is very well suited for it.Let me say to all of you, I have been honored to be involved in the quest for peace here for almost 8 years now.It has been not a passing interest but a passion for me and my administration and, as many of you know, for my family as well.And I want to say a special word of thanks to my wife and to the women here in Northern Ireland who have worked with her through the Vital Voices program and other things to try to make a contribution to the peace.I came here 5 years ago for the first time.Now I am back on my third visit.No other American President can say that.I want you to know that I'm here not just because I have Irish roots, like millions of Americans, and not simply because I love the land and the people.I believe in the peace you are building.I believe there can be no turning back.I believe you are committed to that.And I think it's very important that people the world over see what you are doing and support you along the way.Some of you may know, I left Dublin yesterday, and I had to drive to Dundalk for this rally we had last night&mdash;and there were one or two people there.We had this vast crowd of enthusiastic supporters of the peace.And because the weather was too bad for me to helicopter there and I drove, apparently, some people thought I was going to drive from there to Belfast.So I want to give a special word of thanks to the thousands of people in Armagh who waited along the road.I'm sorry I wasn't there.If I'd known you were there, I would have been there.But thank you for supporting the peace process.Let me say to the leaders who are here and the others who were involved with the development of the Good Friday accord back in 1998, I remember it very well.I remember how hard Prime Ministers Blair and Ahern, and George Mitchell, and all the leaders here worked on the Good Friday accord.I remember time and time again being called, saying that this or that problem had arisen and maybe the agreement couldn't be reached.And just before dawn on Good Friday, when the final momentum was building, one of your leaders said to me in a very tired voice&mdash;I'll never forget it&mdash;This is a life-and-death meeting.And then he added, But we'll make it happen.When they did, I remember saying to that person, Go and claim your moment.That is what I have to say today.After the Good Friday accord was reached, the people of Northern Ireland sealed it in an overwhelming vote for peace.And so I say, it is still for you to claim your moment.Look what has happened: a local government representing all the people; everyday problems addressed by local ministers who answer to local citizens&mdash;across party lines, I might add, as I have personally witnessed; an Executive that has adopted a budget and a program of government; and along the way, all the sort of messy squabbles and fights that you expect in a democracy.I mean, look at us; we've been doing it in America for 224 years, and as you might have noticed, we still have these minor disagreements from time to time.The difficulties of sharing power in a free, peaceful democratic system are nothing compared to the difficulties of not having any power at all or of living with constant insecurity and violence.It's easy to overlook that.When people are in war, they measure the progress by counting victims.When people are involved in peaceful endeavors, it's easy to forget to measure, because the measurement is in pain avoided.Thank you.I'll make you a deal.I'll ignore him if you will.How many days of normality have you gained because the checkpoints on the border aren't there anymore, because honest people can go to a pub or a school or a church without the burden of a search or the threat of a bomb? You have spent so many years mourning your losses.I hope you will now celebrate with pride and defend with passion the progress you have made.Just look at this arena here.Ten years ago I'm not sure you could have gotten the investment necessary to build this arena or to revitalize the entire Laganside area.But over the 5 years just passed, as hopes for peace have grown, the economy has grown, manufacturing up 27 percent, foreign investment almost 70 percent, the number of American firms growing from 40 to 100, 22,000 new jobs there alone, more people coming in than moving out.Once, President Kennedy said that happiness is, I quote, the full use of your powers along lines of excellence.Today, more and more young people have a chance to fully use their powers along lines of excellence here at home.Of course, there are still challenges, to spread opportunity to the most disadvantaged, to integrate into the mainstream those who have turned their backs on violence.But bitter, old divisions are falling away.A few months ago, students from St.Joseph's College and Knockbreda High School, who study a half-mile apart, met for the very first time and toured the sights of Belfast.One of them said, I always just saw their school badge but never talked to them.But when we met, we got on brilliant.Students from both schools are working with their counterparts from Mullingar Community College in the Republic to promote local recycling efforts.They're all taking part in Civic Link, an initiative supported by the Department of Education in the United States.Give them a hand there.So I thank the ones, the students who are here, and I hope more will participate.Now, amidst all this momentum, why are we having this meeting, and why are all you showing up here? Because we've still got problems and headaches.And I just went through a whole lot of meetings about it.Two years ago George Mitchell said that implementing the Good Friday agreement would be harder than negotiating it.Why? Well, first, because the devil is always in the details, and second, because human nature being what it is, it's always easier to talk about high-minded change than it is to pull it off, or even to feel it inside.In spite of the overwhelming support for the Good Friday agreement and the evident progress already brought, opponents of peace still try to exploit the implementation controversies, to rub salt in old wounds, and serve their own ends.And others, for their own purposes, still stand on the sidelines watching and just waiting for something to go wrong.Well, I wanted you all to come together, first to show the world that the great majority of the people of Northern Ireland are still on the side of peace and want it to prevail; second, to say again to the proponents of violence that their way is finished; and third, to reaffirm, even in this great arena, that peace, unlike hockey, is not a spectator sport.No one can afford to sit on the sidelines.The progress that the leaders have made has only been possible because they knew when they took risks for peace they were acting on the yearning of the people for peace.For years you have made your view clear: Violence is not the answer; peace is the path to justice.The Good Friday accords define that path.Last week's tragic killings are a brutal reminder of a past we all wish to leave behind, that is not completely gone and a sober reminder that failing to move forward risks slipping backward.As the promises of the Good Friday accords are fulfilled or deferred, trust between the parties will rise or fall.We have seen that when trust rises and people work together, peace grows stronger, and when trust unravels, peace is made more vulnerable.The people of Northern Ireland must be clear and unequivocal about your support for peace.Remember, the enemies of peace don't really need your approval.All they need is your apathy.I do not believe you want Northern Ireland ever again to be a place where tomorrow's dreams are clouded by yesterday's nightmares.The genius of the Good Friday agreement still remains its core principles of consent, equality, justice, respect for each other and for law and order.These ideas are big enough to embody the aspirations, hopes, and needs of all the people of Northern Ireland.As I said before, your progress in putting these principles into practice has truly been remarkable.But again, we all know there is still much to do before the agreement's vision is fully and finally realized.We know, for example, there must be a full and irrevocable commitment to effecting change only through peaceful means, through ballots, not bullets.That means putting all arms fully, finally, and forever beyond use.Last week's IRA statement on this topic was a welcome development; the followthrough will be even more so.We welcome the contribution of those paramilitaries observing a cease-fire.Those who reject peace should know there is no place for them to hide.Based on my conversations with Prime Minister Ahern in Dublin yesterday and with Prime Minister Blair today, I want to say that the United States will intensify its cooperation with British and Irish authorities on counterterrorism, to combat groups seeking to undermine the Good Friday accords through violence.We are going to get experts from the three nations together in the near future, and the United States will continue to work in a systematic way to do whatever we can to help to root out terrorism and to make this peace agreement take hold.Now, we also know that real respect for human rights must be woven into the fabric of all your institutions.The light this will cast is the best guarantee that political violence will disappear.That's why it is so important to have a police force that inspires pride and confidence in all the people.Just before our gathering here, I met with victims of the violence, quite a large number of them who lost their children, their husbands, their wives, their limbs, their livelihood.Among them was the widow of an RUC officer and the sister of a slain defense attorney.Together, they offer the best testimony to the need to honor those who unjustifiably sacrificed their lives, their health, or their loved ones.We should honor those who have done their duty in the past while making a fresh start toward a police service that will protect, serve, and involve everyone equally in the years to come.Finally, and maybe most important of all, for the vision of the Good Friday agreement to be fully realized, all sides must be fully engaged with each other, understanding that they must move forward together or not at all, that for one community to succeed, the whole community must succeed.Over the last several hours today, I have talked to the parties.I'm convinced they do all genuinely want this peace process to work.They know how far it has come.They know how irresponsible it would be to permit it to fail.On the basis of our discussion, it is clear to me that's what must happen to move the process forward.First, the Patton Report must be implemented, and on that basis leaders from every part of the community must commit to make the new police service work.There must be security normalization, and arms must be put beyond use.This will lead to a reduction of fear and mistrust on all sides.And somehow these processes must take place together, giving practical effect on the ground to the rhetorical promise of peace.I think we can do this.Of course, it will be difficult.But I urge the parties, the political parties here, the British and Irish Governments, the communities themselves, to work out the way forward in the coming days and weeks.And we will do all we can to help.I have said before to all of you&mdash;I did 2 years ago when I was here&mdash;how profoundly important peace in Northern Ireland is to the rest of the world.This morning, when I got up, I saw the Prime Minister of Ethiopia on television, discussing the agreement the United States helped to broker there, between Ethiopia and Eritrea.I have been heavily involved in the Middle East for 8 years now and in many of the tribal conflicts in Africa, in a little-understood border conflict in the Andes, and many other places.And let me tell you, you cannot imagine the impact of the Good Friday agreement in Northern Ireland on troubled regions of the world&mdash;in Africa and the Middle East, in Latin America, and, of course, in the Balkans, where the United States has been heavily involved in my time.Peace continues to be challenged all around the world.It is more important than ever to say, but look what they did in Northern Ireland, and look what they are doing in Northern Ireland.In the end, there has to be a belief that you can only go forward together, that you cannot be lifted up by putting your neighbor down.You know, I think&mdash;and I talk in the United States about this a lot&mdash;our children will live in a completely different world than the one we have known.Just for example, because of the human genome project, which is going to give us cures for many kinds of cancers&mdash;Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and more important, will give mothers bringing little babies home from the hospital, roadmaps of their children's genetic makeup and future&mdash;very soon, life expectancy in places with decent health systems will be over 90 years.And the lives of the young people in this audience, I am convinced, average life expectancy will rise to 100 years.You will see new sources of energy tapped and new conservation technologies developed that will enable human beings for the first time both to increase wealth and to reduce energy use and global warming, ensuring a longer future on this planet for the great-grandchildren of the youngest people in this audience today.You will be able to, you young people, travel farther and faster through outer space and cyberspace even than people can today.The world will be so different for you.Now, I think the children of Northern Ireland deserve their fair chance to be a full part of that future.I believe the people of Northern Ireland want that for their children, and that means the leaders of Northern Ireland must find a way to do what is necessary to give that future to your children.You know, this is the last chance I will have as President to speak to the people of Northern Ireland.Let me say to all of you that I have tried to be pretty straightforward today in my remarks and not nearly as emotional as I feel.I think you know that I have loved this land and love the work I have tried to do for peace.But the issue is not how I feel; it's how your kids are going to live.I say to all of you, it has been a great honor for me; it has been an honor for the United States to be involved in the cause of peace in a land that produced the forbearers of so many of present-day America's citizens.I believe that the United States will be with you in the future.I know I will be with you in the future in whatever way I can.But in the end, I will say again, what really matters is not what America does, and what really matters is not even all the encouragement you give to people around the world.What really matters is what you do and whether you decide to give your children not your own yesterdays but their own tomorrows.Thank you, and God bless you.",clinton
"Hillary, for being my wife, my friend, and my partner in our efforts to build a better future for the children and families of Arkansas and America.Restoring the hopes of the forgotten middle class...It is what we've devoted ourselves to here in Arkansas.I'm proud of what we've done here in Arkansas together.Proud of the work we've done to become a laboratory of democracy and innovation.And proud that we've done it without giving up the things we cherish and honor most about our way of life.For the Soviet Empire never lost to us on the field of battle.I applaud the President's recent initiative in reducing nuclear weapons.It is an important beginning.But make no mistake - the end of the Cold War is not the end of threats to America.The world is still a dangerous and uncertain place.No vision, no action.They've used it to divide us for years.They washed their hands of responsibility for the economy and education and health care and social policy and turned it over to fifty states and a thousand points of light.Well, here in Arkansas we've done our best to create jobs and educate our people.And we will.We have to do a better job of the old-fashioned work of confronting the real problems of real people and pointing the way to a better future.It's both, and it's different.The small towns and main streets of America aren't like the corridors and backrooms of Washington.People out here don't care about the idle rhetoric of left and right and liberal and conservative and all the other words that have made our politics a substitute for action.We don't need another President who doesn't know what he wants to do for America.I'm going to tell you in plain language what I intend to do as President.How we can meet the challenges we face - that's the test for all the Democratic candidates in this campaign.It's just common sense.Government's responsibility is to create more opportunity.We've got to grow this economy, not shrink it.We need to give people Incentives to make long-term investment in America and reward people who produce goods and services, not those who speculate with other people's money.We've got to invest more money in emerging technologies to help keep high-paying jobs here at home.The American people don't want to run from the world.We need more than photo ops and empty rhetoric - we need standards and accountability and excellence in education.And we don't have to bankrupt the taxpayers to do it.We do have to take on the big insurance companies and health care bureaucracies and get some real cost control into the system.Across America, citizens are banding together to take their streets and neighborhoods back.I'm not out to soak the rich.I wouldn't mind being rich.But I do believe the rich should pay their fair share.For 12 years, the Republicans have raised taxes on the middle class.We should give people on welfare the skills they need to succeed, but we should demand that everybody who can work and become a productive member of society.Governments don't raise children, parents do.If you drop out for no good reason, you should lose your driver's license.When they ran their companies into the ground and their employees were on the street, what did they do? They bailed out with golden parachutes to a cushy life.They changed America by standing up for what's right.When Salomon Brothers abused the Treasury markets, the President was silent.In a Clinton Administration, when people sell their companies and their workers and their country down the river, they'll get called on the carpet.We spent more money on the present and the past and less on the future.We spent $500 billion to recycle assets in the S&L mess, but we couldn't afford $5 billion for unemployed workers or to give every kid in this country the chance to be in Head Start.I want to reinvent government to make it more efficient and more effective.I want to give citizens more choices in the services they get, and empower them to make those choices.That's what we've tried to do in Arkansas.We've balanced the budget every year and improved services.We need a new spirit of community, a sense that we are all in this together.If we have no sense of community the American dream will continue to wither.Our destiny is bound up with the destiny of every other American.We talked to a dozen sixth graders, whose number one concern was being shot going to and from school.Their second worry was turning 12 or 13 and being forced to join a gang or be beaten.My mother had been widowed three months before I was born.I was raised for four years by my grandparents, while she went back to nursing school.They didn't have much money.I spent a lot of time with my great-grandparents.By any standard, they were poor.But we didn't blame other people.We took responsibility for ourselves and for each other because we knew we could do better.And that is our generation's responsibility - to form a new covenant...We can usher in a new era of progress, prosperity and renewal.We can &mdash; we must.This is not just a campaign for the Presidency &mdash; it is a campaign for the future, for the forgotten hard-working middle class families of America who deserve a government that fights for them.A campaign to keep America strong at home and around the world.Join with us.I ask for your prayers, your help, your hands, and your hearts.Together we can make America great again, and build a community of hope that will inspire the world.",clinton
"No American foreign policy can succeed if it neglects our domestic needs.And no American foreign policy can succeed if it slights our commitment to democracy.The President often takes a lot of credit for Communism's downfall, but fails to recognize that the global democratic revolution actually gave freedom its birth.He simply does not seem at home in the mainstream pro-democracy tradition of American foreign policy.He shows little regard for the idea that we must have a principled and coherent American purpose in international affairs, something he calls the vision thing.Instead, President Bush seems too often to prefer a foreign policy that embraces stability at the expense of freedom, a foreign policy built more on personal relationships with foreign leaders than on consideration of how those leaders acquired and maintained their power.It is almost as if this Administration were nostalgic for a world of times past, when foreign policy was the exclusive preserve of a few aristocrats.This approach to foreign policy is sometimes described as power politics, to distinguish it from what some contend is sentimentalism and idealism of a pro-democracy foreign policy.But in a world where freedom, not tyranny, is on the march, the cynical calculus of pure power politics simply does not compute.It is ill-suited to a new era in which ideas and information are broadcast around the globe before ambassadors can read their cable.Simple reliance on old balance-of-power strategies cannot bring the same practical success as a foreign policy that draws more generously from American democratic experience and ideals and lights fires in the hearts of millions of freedom-loving people around the world.Military power still matters.And I am committed to maintaining a strong and ready defense.I will use that strength where necessary to defend our vital interests.But power must be accompanied by clear purpose.Mr. Bush's ambivalence about supporting democracy, his eagerness to defend potentates and dictators, has shown itself time and again.It has been a disservice not only to our democratic values, but also to our national interest.For in the long run I believe that Mr.Bush's neglect of our democratic ideals abroad could do as much harm as our neglect of our economic needs at home.Let us look at the record.It reflects an unmistakable pattern in the Bush Administration's foreign policy.Fearing attacks by isolationists in his own party, President Bush was reluctant to offer Boris Yeltsin, Russia's freely elected president, a helping hand.It took a chorus of complaints, culminating with the prodding of another Republican, Richard Nixon, to move him into action on the Russian aid package.Just weeks before the attempted coup in Moscow, President Bush traveled to Ukraine.There he lectured a people subjected to genocidal starvation in the Stalin era, warning that their aspirations for independence constituted, and I quote, a suicidal nationalism.A few months later, the people of Ukraine voted by a huge margin for the immediate and total dissolution of the Soviet Union.But when at long last, the moment of Baltic independence came, President Bush suddenly became a reluctant bridegroom.The United States was 37th among the world's nations to extend diplomatic recognition to these countries.We should have been first..In the Middle East, I supported the President when it became necessary to evict Saddam Hussein from Kuwait, and I support his decision now to provide air cover to Saddam's Kurdish and Shiite opponents in the north and the south of Iraq.But I am angered by the Administration's appeasement of Saddam Hussein before the war and disappointed by its callous disregard for democratic principles after the war.Just this week another friend of freedom, my running mate, Senator Gore, laid out in precise and devastating detail the errors of this Administration in dealing with Saddam Hussein.President Bush showered Government-backed grain credits and high technology on a regime that had used poison gas on its own people.After the war, Mr.Bush encouraged the Iraqi people to revolt against Saddam Hussein but then abandoned them.I support strongly the peace talks that are under way, and if elected, I will continue without interruption America's role in them.I also believe that America's policy in the Middle East should be guided by a vision of the region in which Israel and Arab partners are secure in their peace, and where the practices and principles of the personal liberty and governmental accountability are spreading.",clinton
"Good afternoon.Ladies and gentlemen, I have just heard a summary of President Bush's recently concluded remarks.I'd like to begin by expressing my appreciation for them.I'd like to read this statement.Today I want to reaffirm the essential continuity of American foreign policy and my desire to seek bipartisan support for our role in the world.During the transition that is now beginning, I urge America's friends and foes alike to recognize, as I do, that America has only one President at a time, that America's foreign policy remains solely in his hands, that even as America's Administrations change, America's fundamental interests do not, that the greatest gesture of good will any nation can make toward me is to continue their full cooperation during this period with our one President, George Bush, and that the greatest mistake any adversary could make would be to doubt America's resolve during this period of transition.I look forward to working closely with President Bush to insure continuity in global affairs of interest to all Americans, from continued progress in the Mideast peace talks to completing negotiations on the details of the START II arms control agreement, to making progress toward a good agreement on our world trade talks, to bolstering Russia's fledgling democracy, to working toward peaceful resolution of the conflict in the republics of the former Yugoslavia, to assisting the victims of famine in Somalia.I also look forward to getting to work on the hard and vital task of restoring our nation's economic strength.Today I say to our financial and business leaders that although change is on the horizon, we understand the need to pursue stability even as we pursue new growth.The changes I seek will strengthen America's market systems not weaken them.And to the people of our great nation, for whom we pledge to get up every morning and work hard to bring the economic opportunity that was at the core of the Clinton-Gore campaign, I say that the task has already begun.It will not be easy, but we will spare no effort to restore growth, jobs and incomes to the American people.Let me also stress the stakes and the opportunities in the months and years that lie ahead.The cold war is won.Now we have a chance to build a new peace.We have entered a global economy.Now we have the opportunity to master its competitive challenges rather than let these changes undermine our strength.We have become a diverse people of many colors and languages and beliefs.Now we have the obligation to insure that our diversity is a source of strength and pride to all of us here at home and around the world.We've become a nation of 250 million Americans.Now we have the opportunity, the duty and the imperative to see that we do not leave even one of those 250 million behind as we move toward the next century.We have entered a period of great challenge and extraordinary opportunity for our nation.I am confident we can make it a proud time in our history, proud for the families who are raising this nation's next generation, proud for the workers and businesses who are America's lifeblood, proud for the men and women who wear America's uniforms and proud for the peoples of other nations living today in freedom, or in fear, who draw strength from American ideals, and share our vision of a peaceful and more prosperous world.America has called upon me to be our next President.But our forebears call on all of us at this moment to honor their efforts, their sacrifices, their ideals and their lives by working hard and working together to improve this good and great nation as much for our children and our children's children as those who preceded us did for us.They call on us to take our dreams and our hopes and make them real.Thank you, and God bless America.",clinton
"PRESIDENT-ELECT BILL CLINTON Today, I have asked you here to announce the first members of our economic team.These people are seasoned, skilled, incredibly able and ready to work for the American people.I stress the word team because the success of our economic action agenda will depend not only on the talents of these people as individuals and those whom I will announce in the next few days, but also in their capacity to work together for the common good of all Americans.They are deeply aware that we must not be the first generation of Americans to leave a worse economy to our children.And as I have said repeatedly, our nation faces two deficits, a budget deficit and an investment deficit.I'm going to work my heart out with these people to construct a strong, long-term plan for economic growth, for jobs, for incomes, and to reduce our national debt.My first appointment, intentionally, is the Secretary of the Treasury.In filling this post, I wanted someone who had the unique capacity to command the respect of Wall Street, which showing an unrelenting concern for the Americans who make their living on Main Street.When Lloyd Bentsen agreed to serve as Secretary of the Treasury, it is safe to say I succeeded.In American politics when you say the words stature, dignity, and respects, Lloyd Bentsen's name comes right to mind.I've known Senator Bentsen for many years, and, as a few of my folks know, I've had him in mind for this position for a long time, long before I was actually elected President.I followed his work for years as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee; I know about the tax bills he tried to have written into law, which would have promoted more investment and less consumption; I know about the trade positions he's tried to convince our country to take which would have promoted more free trade but a tougher set of demand to open markets to American products.But he, too, needs a team, and the team that will take the helm at the Treasury Department is truly exceptional, in part because of the creativity and quality of the person who will be appointed as deputy secretary of the Treasury, Roger Altman.Roger is a longtime friend of mine, a former assistant secretary of the Treasury, a preeminent investment banker.And he's been one of my closest economic advisers throughout this entire campaign.As director of the Office of Management and Budget, Congressman Leon Panetta will bring integrity to this critical office and restore the confidence of the American people and their elected representatives that O.M.B.is shooting straight with the Congress and shooting straight with the American people, and doing its best to help us not only to have a responsible budget but to manage the massive American Government in a different and better way than ever before.As chairman of the House Budget Committee, Leon Panetta brought a unique combination of strong leadership and superb technical skills.With Leon Panetta as O.M.B.director, I believe that agency can play the pivotal role we have to have it play in the swift and effective implementation of our economic plan.I'm also delighted to announce that Alice Rivlin, the former director of the Congressional Budget Office and one of our nation's most respected budget experts, has agreed to serve as deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget.Together, Alice and Leon promise to be the most dynamic team in the history of O.M.B.and to restore the confidence of the Congress that the executive branch is going to be a responsible partner in making the budgets of this country.Finally, I have asked Robert Rubin to serve as assistant to the President for economic policy and to help to coordinate and to direct our new Economic Council.I've created this new role, similar to that of the national security adviser in the present White House, because the coordination of our nation's economic policy is every bit as essential as the coordination of foreign policy to our long-term national security.Bob Rubin has enjoyed a brilliant career at his firm, and has throughout manifested concern for the welfare of all Americans, and a special concern for the welfare of the inner city poor for whom he has worked as a member of the Cuomo Commission and in other contexts.This new Economic Council which I will chair embodies our commitment to make economic prosperity the top priority of this administration and to sharply focus on economic policy in the White House.Today's appointments are just the first of many.In the coming days and before too long, we will have appointed the entire economic team and the remainder of the Cabinet.Rubin from Mr.Bentsen, or Mr.Bentsen from Mr.Rubin? It's not quite clear what each one will be doing here.PRESIDENT-ELECT CLINTON Well, I think it is quite clear.First of all, the Secretary of the Treasury will continue to be the principal economic spokesperson after the President for this Administration, just as it has traditionally occurred.Mr.Rubin's job will be very much like General Scowcroft's job on the national security side in this Administration.His job will be to coordinate, to facilitate and to provide some direction to the deliberations of our economic council.It will be a larger group than the National Security Council because it will include not only these departments, but also some others which I have discussed with you before, like Commerce, Labor, Energy.And it is a very important job.But in the end, I will make the ultimate decisions and be the ultimate arbiter when there has to be an arbiter.I think that if you go back to the campaign structure that we tried to provide, which really did defy past organizations because it was less hierarchical and more team work oriented, that's what I expect to provide here.And I think that because we want to bring in more people in a more systematic way and reconcile what these departments are doing so they can reinforce and energy one another, I decided that I needed someone on the domestic side to be that sort of coordinator and facilitator but these departments, each will stand on their own.The Treasury will still be the place where the President's economic views are spoken for after the President does it.SENATOR LLOYD BENTSEN I've heard all these stories about my being an insider.Let me tell you, I felt like an outsider for 12 years.And I'm tired of the gridlock.To do the things we've tried to do on campaign reform, do the things we tried to do on a tough crime bill, to do the things that we did in the last tax bill, to put economic incentives in there to create jobs, and to get this country moving again, and to see those kinds of things vetoed, I'm just delighted to see us be able to bring about the kind of change, to create those jobs now, with a Democratic President, a Democratic President like Bill Clinton.I think you're going to see those hopes turn into reality.And to be able to pass those and put them into law is what I'm so pleased about.And as far as the Secretary of the Treasury's job, I know you're probably looking for more maturity in that job.But I'll do what I can.REPRESENTATIVE LEON E.PANETTA I think everyone that knows me as chairman of the Budget Committee and my work on the budget, we've been basically fighting the budgets that have been presented over the last 12 years concerned about the priorities that we part of those budgets, the failure to invest in our society, and the fact that they would ultimately produce the record deficits that they have produced.So I've been fighting against those kinds of budgets in the time I've been in Congress, and I think the President-elect and I share a common commitment, not only to long-term deficit reduction, but to making the investments in education and health care and infrastructure and growth that this Administration has failed to make over the last few years.But the Democratic Party in Texas is in great shape and we have a very effective and attractive Governor who will be making that decision and that choice and who will play a major role in that campaign and I think the odds are just excellent that a Democrat will succeed me in that spot.PRESIDENT-ELECT CLINTON I did give it some thought.It crossed my mind.I think that frankly the kind of leadership that has been provided in Texas by people like Ann Richards, Henry Cisneros, John Sharp, that they and many others have embodied the kind of new Democratic Party that we're trying to bring to the United States.And I think there's a good chance that Governor Richards will name someone senator who will have the confidence of the people of Texas.I thought about it.But I also thought that Senator Bentsen was the best choice for America for Treasury Secretary and I think the people of Texas will respond to that.But I don't think there's any reason to believe that the Democrats can't be highly competitive in that job.Do you believe that there is a need for additional inquiries in that? And will you appoint, have your Justice Department appoint, a special prosecutor after you take office? PRESIDENT-ELECT CLINTON I certainly think we need to know more about it than we now know.And what I intend to do is to appoint an Attorney General and then get a recommendation on it.And generically, let me make a statement, the special prosecutor law, as you know, either just did or is about to expire and I had to tell you, I think it should be reenacted.And I will support that.",clinton
"She had thick blond hair, big glasses, wore no makeup, and she had a sense of strength and self-possession that I found magnetic.After the class I followed her out, intending to introduce myself.I got close enough to touch her back, but I couldn't do it.Somehow I knew this would not be just another tap on the shoulder, that I might be starting something I couldn't stop.And I saw her several more times in the next few days, but I still didn't speak to her.Then one night I was in the law library talking to a classmate who wanted me to join the Yale Law Journal.He said it would guarantee me a job in a big firm or a clerkship with a federal judge.I really wasn't interested, I just wanted to go home to Arkansas.Finally she was staring back at me, so I watched her.She closed her book, put it down and started walking toward me.I remember, she was wearing a long, white, flowery skirt.And I went up to her and she said she was going to register for classes for the next term.And I said I'd go, too.And I thought, well, heck, since my cover's been blown I just went ahead and asked her to take a walk down to the art museum.We've been walking and talking and laughing together ever since.We cried together this morning on the news that our good friend and a lot of your good friend, Mark Weiner, passed away early this morning.We've built up a lifetime of memories.Her crusty, conservative father, her rambunctious brothers, all extolling the virtues of rooting for the Bears and the Cuba.She was more liberal than the boys.And she had a childhood that made mine look like a piece of cake.She was easy to underestimate with her soft manner and she reminded me all over again of the truth of that old saying you should never judge a book by its covers.Knowing her was one of the greatest gifts Hillary ever gave me.He took her downtown to Chicago to hear Dr.Martin Luther King speak and he remained her friend for the rest of his life.This will be the only campaign of hers he ever missed.When she got to college, her support for civil rights, her opposition to the Vietnam War compelled her to change party, to become a Democrat.She got so involved in children's issues that she actually took an extra year in law school working at the child studies center to learn what more could be done to improve the lives and the futures of poor children.In the summer of 1972, she went to Dothan, Alabama to visit one of those segregated academies that then enrolled over half-a-million white kids in the South.The only way the economics worked is if they claimed federal tax exemptions to which they were not legally entitled.She got sent to prove they weren't.So she sauntered into one of these academies all by herself, pretending to be a housewife that had just moved to town and needed to find a school for her son.And they exchanged pleasantries and finally she said, look, let's just get to the bottom line here, if I enroll my son in this school will he be in a segregated school, yes or know? And the guy said absolutely.And she went back and her encounter was part of a report that gave Marian Marian Wright Edelman the ammunition she needed to keep working to force the Nixon administration to take those tax exemptions away and give our kids access to an equal education.I think some of them are still around to vote for her in 2016.And she filed a report on that, which led to some changes, too.Always making things better.I was trying to convince her to marry me.And we were on the shoreline of this wonderful little lake, Lake Ennerdale.I asked her to marry me and she said I can't do it.This time trying to figure out why so many kids counted in the Census weren't enrolled in school.She found one of them sitting alone on her porch in a wheelchair.Once more, she filed a report about these kids, and that helped influence ultimately the Congress to adopt the proposition that children with disabilities, physical or otherwise, should have equal access to public education.I said I really want you to marry me, but you shouldn't do it.I said I know, but it's true.And I meant it, it was true.I said I know most of the young Democrats our age who want to go into politics, they mean well and they speak well, but none of them is as good as you are at actually doing things to make positive changes in people's lives.She just laughed and said, are you out of you mind, nobody would ever vote for me.And she decided to take a huge chance.She moved to a strange place, more rural, more culturally conservative than anyplace she had ever been, where she knew good and well people would wonder what in the world she was like and whether they could or should accept her.Didn't take them long to find out what she was like.She loved her teaching and she got frustrated when one of her students said, well, what do you expect, I'm just from Arkansas.She said, don't tell me that, you're as smart as anybody, you've just got to believe in yourself and work hard and set high goals.She believed that anybody could make it.And one day I was driving her to the airport to fly back to Chicago when we passed this little brick house that had a for sale sign on it.And she said, boy, that's a pretty house.It had 1,100 square feet, an attic, fan and no air conditioner in hot Arkansas, and a screened-in porch.Hillary commented on what a uniquely designed and beautiful house it was.So I took a big chance.I bought the house.My mortgage was $175 a month.I said, while you were gone I bought it, you have to marry me now.I married my best friend.I was still in awe after more than four years of being around her at how smart and strong and loving and caring she was.And I really hoped that her choosing me and rejecting my advice to pursue her own career was a decision she would never regret.A little over a year later we moved to Little Rock when I became attorney general and she joined the oldest law firm west of the Mississippi.Soon after, she started a group called the Arkansas Advocates for Families and Children.They recommended to do that partly by deploying trained nurse practitioners in places with no doctors to provide primary care they were trained to provide.It was a big deal then, highly controversial and very important.And I got the feeling that what she did for the rest of her life she was doing there.She just went out and figured out what needed to be done and what made the most sense and what would help the most people.And then if it was controversial she'd just try to persuade people it was the right thing to do.We found out we were going to be parents.On February 27th, 1980, 15 minutes after I got home from the National Governors Conference in Washington, Hillary's water broke and off we went to the hospital.Chelsea was born just before midnight.The miracle of a new beginning.The hole it filled for me because my own father died before I was born, and the absolute conviction that my daughter had the best mother in the whole world.The truth is we rarely disagreed on parenting, although she did believe that I had gone a little over the top when I took a couple of days off with Chelsea to watch all six Police Academy movies back-to-back.And I became overnight, I think, the youngest former governor in the history of the country.We only had two-year terms back then.Hillary was great.Immediately she said, OK, what are we going to do? Here's what we're going to do, we're going to get a house, you're going to get a job, we're going to enjoy being Chelsea's parents.And if you really want to run again, you've got to go out and talk to people and figure out why you lost, tell people you got the message and show them you've still got good ideas.I followed her advice.Within two days we had a house, I soon had a job.We had two fabulous years with Chelsea.And in 1982, I became the first governor in the history of our state to be elected, defeated and elected again.The rest of the decade sort of flew by as our lives settled into a rhythm of family and work and friends.In 1983, Hillary chaired a committee to recommend new education standards for us as a part of and in response to a court order to equalize school funding and a report by a national expert that said our woefully underfunded schools were the worst in America.Typical Hillary, she held listening tours in all 75 counties with our committee.She came up with really ambitious recommendations.For example, that we be the first state in America to require elementary counselors in every school because so many kids were having trouble at home and they needed it.And that's because of those standards that Hillary developed.The idea was to teach low-income parents, even those that couldn't read, to be their children's first teachers.She said she thought it would work in Arkansas.I said that's great, what are we going to do about it? She said, oh, I already did it.I called the woman who started the program in Israel, she'll be here in about 10 days and help us get started.Next thing you know I'm being dragged around to all these little preschool graduations.Now, keep in mind, this was before any state even had universal kindergarten and I'm being dragged to preschool graduations watching these poor parents with tears in their eyes because they never thought they'd be able to help their kids learn.There are a lot of young adults in America who have no idea Hillary had anything to do with it who are enjoying better lives because they were in that program.She did all this while being a full-time worker, a mother and enjoying our life.Why? Well, she's insatiably curious, she's a natural leader, she's a good organizer, and she's the best darn change-maker I ever met in my entire life.This is a really important point for you to take out of this convention.If you believe in making change from the bottom up, if you believe the measure of change is how many people's lives are better, you know it's hard and some people think it's boring.So people say, well, we need to change.She's been around a long time, she sure has, and she's sure been worth every single year she's put into making people's lives better.If you were sitting where I'm sitting and you heard what I have heard at every dinner conversation, every lunch conversation, on every lone walk, you would say this woman has never been satisfied with the status quo in anything.She always wants to move the ball forward.That is just who she is.You all know we failed because we couldn't break a Senate filibuster.Hillary immediately went to work on solving the problems the bill sought to address one by one.The most important goal was to get more children with health insurance.It insures more than 8 million kids.There are a lot of other things in that bill that she got done piece by piece, pushing that rock up the hill.In 1997, she also teamed with the House Minority Leader Tom DeLay, who maybe disliked me more than any of Newt Gingrich's crowd.They worked on a bill together to increase adoptions of children under foster care.She wanted to do it because she knew that Tom DeLay, for all of our differences, was an adoptive parent and she honored him for doing that.It made life better because she's a change-maker, that's what she does.1997 was the year Chelsea finished high school and went to college.We were happy for her, but sad for us to see her go.I'll never forget moving her into her dorm room at Stanford.It would have been a great little reality flick.So we closed a big chapter in the most important work of our lives.As you'll see Thursday night when Chelsea speaks, Hillary's done a pretty fine job of being a mother.We had always intended to go to New York after I left office and commute to Arkansas, but this had never occurred to either one of us.Hillary had never run for office before, but she decided to give it a try.She began her campaign the way she always does new things, by listening and and learning.And after a tough battle, New York elected her to the seat once held by another outsider, Robert Kennedy.Her early years were dominated by 9/11, by working to fund the recovery, then monitoring the health and providing compensation to victims and first and second responders.She and Senator Schumer were tireless and so were our House members.In 2003, partly spurred on by what we were going through, she became the first senator in the history of New York ever to serve on the Armed Services Committee.She tried to expand and did expand health care coverage to Reservists and members of the National Guard.She got longer family leave, working with Senator Dodd, for people caring for wounded service members.And she worked for more extensive care for people with traumatic brain injury.She also served on a special Pentagon commission to propose changes necessary to meet our new security challenges.Newt Gingrich was on that commission, he told me what a good job she had done.They are a national treasure of all races, all religions, all walks of life.She voted for and against some proposed trade deals.She became the de facto economic development officer for the area of New York outside the ambit of New York City.She worked for farmers, for winemakers, for small businesses and manufacturers, for upstate cities in rural areas who needed more ideas and more new investment to create good jobs, something we have to do again in small-town and rural America, in neighborhoods that have been left behind in our cities and Indian country and, yes, in coal country.But she hesitated to say yes when he asked her to join his Cabinet because she so loved being a senator from New York.So like me, in a different context, he had to keep asking.And in what The Wall Street Journal no less called a half-court shot at the buzzer, she got Russia and China to support them.Her team negotiated the New START Treaty with Russia to reduce nuclear weapons and reestablish inspections.And she got enough Republican support to get two-thirds of the Senate, the vote necessary to ratify the treaty.She tripled the number of people with AIDS in poor countries whose lives are being saved with your tax dollars, most of them in Africa, going from 1.7 million lives to 5.1 million lives and it didn't cost you any more money.She just bought available FDA-approved generic drugs, something we need to do for the American people more.You don't know any of those 3.4 million people, but I'll guarantee you they know you.They know you because they see you as thinking their lives matter.They know you and that's one reason the approval of the United States was 20 points higher when she left the secretary of state's office than when she took it.One is real, the other is made up.You just have to decide.You just have to decide which is which, my fellow Americans.The real one had done more positive change-making before she was 30 than many public officials do in a lifetime in office.Cartoons are two-dimensional, they're easy to absorb.Life in the real world is complicated and real change is hard.And a lot of people even think it's boring.You guys calm down.Look, I have lived a long, full, blessed life, it really took off when I met and fell in love with that girl in the spring of 1971.When I was president, I worked hard to give you more peace and shared prosperity, to give you an America where nobody is invisible or counted out.And she is still the best darn change-maker I have ever known.That is just who she is.But we won't get to them if America makes the wrong choice in this election.That's why you should elect her.And you should elect her because she'll never quit when the going gets tough.She'll never quit on you.She sent me in this primary to West Virginia where she knew we were going to lose, to look those coal miners in the eye and say I'm down here because Hillary sent me to tell you that if you really think you can get the economy back you had 50 years ago, have at it, vote for whoever you want to.But if she wins, she is coming back for you to take you along on the ride to America's future.We want you.You know it because she's spent a lifetime doing it.I hope you will do it.I hope you will elect her.Those of us who have more yesterdays than tomorrows tend to care more about our children and grandchildren.The reason you should elect her is that in the greatest country on earth we have always been about tomorrow.You children and grandchildren will bless you forever if you do.God bless you.Thank you.",clinton
"Warm greetings to everyone celebrating Hanukkah.Every year during the month of Kislev on the Hebrew calendar, Jews around the world celebrate the Festival of Lights.They remember with sorrow the desecration of the Holy Temple, with pride the triumph of the Maccabees over the forces of oppression, and with a renewed faith in God's providence the miracle of a day's worth of oil burning for eight straight days&mdash; a miracle commemorated by lighting the candles of the menorah.This year, Hanukkah is celebrated during the same week Christians celebrate Christmas and Muslims celebrate the Eid Al-Fitr.The coinciding of these special days, sacred to followers of the world's three Abrahamic faiths, serves as a powerful reminder of the fundamental values we share: a reverence for our Creator, a belief in human dignity, and a conviction that we must love our neighbors as ourselves.These ancient lessons still hold great meaning for us today, as the global community grows ever closer and American society becomes increasingly diverse.By taking them to heart at this blessed season, we can build a future where we respect one another's differences, embrace our shared values, and where all God's children live together in peace.Hillary joins me in extending best wishes to all for a joyous Hanukkah celebration.",clinton
"On behalf of the great state of Illinois, crossroads of a nation, Land of Lincoln, let me expressmy deepest gratitude for the privilege of addressing this convention.Tonight is a particular honor for me because, lets face it, my presence on this stage is prettyunlikely. My father was a foreign student, born and raised in a small village in Kenya. He grewup herding goats, went to school in a tin-roof shack. His father -- my grandfather -- was acook, a domestic servant to the British.But my grandfather had larger dreams for his son. Through hard work and perseverance myfather got a scholarship to study in a magical place, America, that shone as a beacon offreedom and opportunity to so many who had come before.While studying here, my father met my mother. She was born in a town on the other side ofthe world, in Kansas. Her father worked on oil rigs and farms through most of the Depression.The day after Pearl Harbor my grandfather signed up for duty; joined Pattons army, marchedacross Europe. Back home, my grandmother raised a baby and went to work on a bomberassembly line. After the war, they studied on the G.I. Bill, bought a house through F.H.A., andlater moved west all the way to Hawaii in search of opportunity.And they, too, had big dreams for their daughter. A common dream, born of two continents.My parents shared not only an improbable love, they shared an abiding faith in thepossibilities of this nation. They would give me an African name, Barack, or blessed,believing that in a tolerant America your name is no barrier to success. They imagined -- Theyimagined me going to the best schools in the land, even though they werent rich, because ina generous America you dont have to be rich to achieve your potential.They're both passed away now. And yet, I know that on this night they look down on me withgreat pride.They stand here, and I stand here today, grateful for the diversity of my heritage, aware thatmy parents dreams live on in my two precious daughters. I stand here knowing that my storyis part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me,and that, in no other country on earth, is my story even possible.Tonight, we gather to affirm the greatness of our Nation -- not because of the height of ourskyscrapers, or the power of our military, or the size of our economy. Our pride is based on avery simple premise, summed up in a declaration made over two hundred years ago: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they areendowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are Life,Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.That is the true genius of America, a faith -- a faith in simple dreams, an insistence on smallmiracles; that we can tuck in our children at night and know that they are fed and clothed andsafe from harm; that we can say what we think, write what we think, without hearing asudden knock on the door; that we can have an idea and start our own business withoutpaying a bribe; that we can participate in the political process without fear of retribution, andthat our votes will be counted -- at least most of the time.This year, in this election we are called to reaffirm our values and our commitments, to holdthem against a hard reality and see how we're measuring up to the legacy of our forbearersand the promise of future generations.And fellow Americans, Democrats, Republicans, Independents, I say to you tonight: We havemore work to do --  more work to do for the workers I met in Galesburg, Illinois, who arelosing their union jobs at the Maytag plant thats moving to Mexico, and now are having tocompete with their own children for jobs that pay seven bucks an hour; more to do for thefather that I met who was losing his job and choking back the tears, wondering how he wouldpay 4500 dollars a month for the drugs his son needs without the health benefits that hecounted on; more to do for the young woman in East St. Louis, and thousands more like her,who has the grades, has the drive, has the will, but doesnt have the money to go to college.Now, dont get me wrong. The people I meet -- in small towns and big cities, in diners andoffice parks -- they dont expect government to solve all their problems. They know they haveto work hard to get ahead,  and they want to. Go into the collar counties around Chicago, andpeople will tell you they dont want their tax money wasted, by a welfare agency or by thePentagon. Go in -- Go into any inner city neighborhood, and folks will tell you thatgovernment alone cant teach our kids to learn; they know that parents have to teach, thatchildren cant achieve unless we raise their expectations and turn off the television sets anderadicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white. They know thosethings.People dont expect -- People don't expect government to solve all their problems. But theysense, deep in their bones, that with just a slight change in priorities, we can make sure thatevery child in America has a decent shot at life, and that the doors of opportunity remain opento all.They know we can do better. And they want that choice.In this election, we offer that choice. Our Party has chosen a man to lead us who embodiesthe best this country has to offer. And that man is John Kerry.John Kerry understands the ideals of community, faith, and service because theyve definedhis life. From his heroic service to Vietnam, to his years as a prosecutor and lieutenantgovernor, through two decades in the United States Senate, he's devoted himself to thiscountry. Again and again, weve seen him make tough choices when easier ones wereavailable.His values and his record affirm what is best in us. John Kerry believes in an America wherehard work is rewarded; so instead of offering tax breaks to companies shipping jobs overseas,he offers them to companies creating jobs here at home.John Kerry believes in an America where all Americans can afford the same health coverageour politicians in Washington have for themselves.John Kerry believes in energy independence, so we arent held hostage to the profits of oilcompanies, or the sabotage of foreign oil fields.John Kerry believes in the Constitutional freedoms that have made our country the envy ofthe world, and he will never sacrifice our basic liberties, nor use faith as a wedge to divide us.And John Kerry believes that in a dangerous world war must be an option sometimes, but itshould never be the first option.You know, a while back -- awhile back I met a young man named Shamus in a V.F.W. Hall inEast Moline, Illinois. He was a good-looking kid -- six two, six three, clear eyed, with an easysmile. He told me hed joined the Marines and was heading to Iraq the following week. And asI listened to him explain why hed enlisted, the absolute faith he had in our country and itsleaders, his devotion to duty and service, I thought this young man was all that any of usmight ever hope for in a child.But then I asked myself, ""Are we serving Shamus as well as he is serving us?""I thought of the 900 men and women -- sons and daughters, husbands and wives, friends andneighbors, who wont be returning to their own hometowns. I thought of the families Ive metwho were struggling to get by without a loved ones full income, or whose loved ones hadreturned with a limb missing or nerves shattered, but still lacked long-term health benefitsbecause they were Reservists.When we send our young men and women into harms way, we have a solemn obligation notto fudge the numbers or shade the truth about why theyre going, to care for their familieswhile theyre gone, to tend to the soldiers upon their return, and to never ever go to warwithout enough troops to win the war, secure the peace, and earn the respect of the world.Now -- Now let me be clear. Let me be clear. We have real enemies in the world. Theseenemies must be found. They must be pursued. And they must be defeated. John Kerry knowsthis. And just as Lieutenant Kerry did not hesitate to risk his life to protect the men whoserved with him in Vietnam, President Kerry will not hesitate one moment to use our militarymight to keep America safe and secure.John Kerry believes in America. And he knows that its not enough for just some of us toprosper -- for alongside our famous individualism, theres another ingredient in the Americansaga,  a belief that were all connected as one people. If there is a child on the south side ofChicago who cant read, that matters to me, even if its not my child. If there is a seniorcitizen somewhere who cant pay for their prescription drugs, and having to choose betweenmedicine and the rent, that makes my life poorer, even if its not my grandparent. If theresan Arab American family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process, thatthreatens my civil liberties.It is that fundamental belief -- It is that fundamental belief: I am my brothers keeper. I ammy sisters keeper that makes this country work. Its what allows us to pursue our individualdreams and yet still come together as one American family.E pluribus unum: ""Out of many, one.""Now even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us -- the spin masters,the negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of ""anything goes."" Well, I say to themtonight, there is not a liberal America and a conservative America -- there is the United Statesof America. There is not a Black America and a White America and Latino America and AsianAmerica -- theres the United States of America.The pundits, the pundits like to slice-and-dice our country into red states and blue states; redstates for Republicans, blue states for Democrats. But Ive got news for them, too. Weworship an awesome God in the blue states, and we dont like federal agents poking around inour libraries in the red states. We coach Little League in the blue states and yes, weve gotsome gay friends in the red states. There are patriots who opposed the war in Iraq and thereare patriots who supported the war in Iraq. We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance tothe stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America.In the end -- In the end -- In the end, thats what this election is about. Do we participate in apolitics of cynicism or do we participate in a politics of hope?John Kerry calls on us to hope. John Edwards calls on us to hope.Im not talking about blind optimism here -- the almost willful ignorance that thinksunemployment will go away if we just dont think about it, or the health care crisis will solveitself if we just ignore it. Thats not what Im talking about. Im talking about something moresubstantial. Its the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs; the hope ofimmigrants setting out for distant shores; the hope of a young naval lieutenant bravelypatrolling the Mekong Delta; the hope of a millworkers son who dares to defy the odds; thehope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him, too.Hope -- Hope in the face of difficulty. Hope in the face of uncertainty. The audacity of hope!In the end, that is Gods greatest gift to us, the bedrock of this nation. A belief in things notseen. A belief that there are better days ahead.I believe that we can give our middle class relief and provide working families with a road toopportunity.I believe we can provide jobs to the jobless, homes to the homeless, and reclaim youngpeople in cities across America from violence and despair.I believe that we have a righteous wind at our backs and that as we stand on the crossroadsof history, we can make the right choices, and meet the challenges that face us.America! Tonight, if you feel the same energy that I do, if you feel the same urgency that Ido, if you feel the same passion that I do, if you feel the same hopefulness that I do -- if wedo what we must do, then I have no doubt that all across the country, from Florida to Oregon,from Washington to Maine, the people will rise up in November, and John Kerry will be swornin as President, and John Edwards will be sworn in as Vice President, and this country willreclaim its promise, and out of this long political darkness a brighter day will come.Thank you very much everybody.God bless you.Thank you.",obama

"I love you back.A little less than one year from today, you will go into the voting booth and you will select thePresident of the United States of America. Now, heres the good news -- the name George W.Bush will not be on the ballot. The name of my cousin Dick Cheney will not be on the ballot.Weve been trying to hide that for a long time. Everybody has a black sheep in the family. Theera of Scooter Libby justice, and Brownie incompetence, and Karl Rove politics will finally beover.But the question youre going to have to ask yourself when you caucus in January and youvote in November is, Whats next for America? We are in a defining moment in ourhistory. Our nation is at war. The planet is in peril. The dream that so many generationsfought for feels as if its slowly slipping away. We are working harder for less. Weve neverpaid more for health care or for college.  Its harder to save and its harder to retire. And mostof all weve lost faith that our leaders can or will do anything about it.We were promised compassionate conservatism and all we got was Katrina and wiretaps. Wewere promised a uniter, and we got a President who could not even lead the half of thecountry that voted for him. We were promised a more ethical and more efficient government,and instead we have a town called Washington that is more corrupt and more wasteful than itwas before. And the only mission that was ever accomplished is to use fear and falsehood totake this country to a war that should have never been authorized and should have neverbeen waged.It is because of these failures that America is listening, intently, to what we say here today --not just Democrats, but Republicans and Independents whove lost trust in their government,but want to believe again. And it is because of these failures that we not only have a momentof great challenge, but also a moment of great opportunity. We have a chance to bring thecountry together in a new majority -- to finally tackle problems that George Bush made farworse, but that had festered long before George Bush ever took office -- problems that wevetalked about year after year after year after year.And that is why the same old Washington textbook campaigns just wont do in this election. Thats why not answering questions cause we are afraid our answers wont be popular justwont do. Thats why telling the American people what we think they want to hear instead oftelling the American people what they need to hear just wont do. Triangulating and poll-driven positions because were worried about what Mitt or Rudy might say about us just wontdo. If we are really serious about wining this election Democrats, we cant live in fear of losingit.This party -- the party of Jefferson and Jackson, of Roosevelt and Kennedy -- has alwaysmade the biggest difference in the lives of the American people when we led, not by polls, butby principle; not by calculation, but by conviction; when we summoned the entire nation to acommon purpose -- a higher purpose. And I run for the Presidency of the United States ofAmerica because thats the party America needs us to be right now.A party that offers not just a difference in policies, but a difference in leadership.A party that doesnt just focus on how to win but why we should.A party that doesnt just offer change as a slogan, but real, meaningful change -- change thatAmerica can believe in.Thats why Im in this race. Thats why I am running for the Presidency of the United States ofAmerica -- to offer change that we can believe in.I am in this race to tell the corporate lobbyists that their days of setting the agenda inWashington are over. I have done more than any other candidate in this race to take onlobbyists -- and won. They have not funded my campaign, they will not get a job in my WhiteHouse, and they will not drown out the voices of the American people when I am President.Im in this race to take those tax breaks away from companies that are moving jobs overseasand put them in the pockets of hard working Americans who deserve it. And I wont raise theminimum wage every ten years -- I will raise it to keep pace so that workers dont fall behind.That is why I am in it. To protect the American worker. To fight for the American worker.Im in this race because I want to stop talking about the outrage of 47 million Americanswithout health care and start actually doing something about it. I expanded health care inIllinois by bringing Democrats and Republicans together.  By taking on the insuranceindustry. And that is how I will make certain that every single American in this country hashealth care they can count on and I wont do it twenty years from now, I wont do it ten yearsfrom now, I will do it by the end of my first term as President of the United States of America.I run for president to make sure that every American child has the best education that wehave to offer -- from the day they are born to the day they graduate from college. And I wontjust talk about how great teachers are -- as President I will reward them for their greatness --by raising salaries and giving them more support. Thats why Im in this race.I am running for President because I am sick and tired of democrats thinking that the onlyway to look tough on national security is by talking, and acting, and voting like George BushRepublicans.When I am this partys nominee, my opponent will not be able to say that I voted for the warin Iraq; or that I gave George Bush the benefit of the doubt on Iran; or that I supported Bush-Cheney policies of not talking to leaders that we dont like. And he will not be able to say thatI wavered on something as fundamental as whether or not it is ok for America to torture --because it is never ok. Thats why I am in it.As President, I will end the war in Iraq. We will have our troops home in sixteen months. I willclose Guantanamo. I will restore habeas corpus. I will finish the fight against Al Qaeda. And Iwill lead the world to combat the common threats of the 21st century -- nuclear weapons andterrorism; climate change and poverty; genocide and disease. And I will send once more amessage to those yearning faces beyond our shores that says, You matter to us. Your futureis our future. And our moment is now.America, our moment is now. Our moment is now. I dont want to spend the next year or thenext four years re-fighting the same fights that we had in the 1990s. I dont want to pit RedAmerica against Blue America, I want to be the President of the United States of America.And if those Republicans come at me with the same fear-mongering and swift-boating thatthey usually do, then I will take them head on. Because I believe the American people aretired of fear and tired of distractions and tired of diversions. We can make this election notabout fear, but about the future. And that wont just be a Democratic victory; that will be anAmerican victory. And that is a victory America needs right now.I am not in this race to fulfill some long-held ambitions or because I believe its somehowowed to me. I never expected to be here, I always knew this journey was improbable. Ivenever been on a journey that wasnt. I am running in this race because of what Dr. King calledthe fierce urgency of now.  Because I believe that theres such a thing as being too late. And that hour is almost upon us.I dont want to wake up four years from now and find out that millions of Americans still lackhealth care because we couldnt take on the insurance industry.I dont want to see that the oceans have risen a few more inches. The planet has reached apoint of no return because we couldnt find a way to stop buying oil from dictators.I dont want to see more American lives put at risk because no one had the judgment or thecourage to stand up against a misguided war before we sent our troops into fight.I dont want to see homeless veterans on the streets. I dont want to send another generationof American children to failing schools. I dont want that future for my daughters. I dont wantthat future for your sons. I do not want that future for America.Im in this race for the same reason that I fought for jobs for the jobless and hope for thehopeless on the streets of Chicago; for the same reason I fought for justice and equality as acivil rights lawyer; for the same reason that I fought for Illinois families for over a decade.Because I will never forget that the only reason that Im standing here today is becausesomebody, somewhere stood up for me when it was risky. Stood up when it was hard. Stoodup when it wasnt popular. And because that somebody stood up, a few more stood up. Andthen a few thousand stood up. And then a few million stood up. And standing up, with courageand clear purpose, they somehow managed to change the world.Thats why Im running, Iowa -- to give our children and grandchildren the same chancessomebody gave me.Thats why Im running, Democrats -- to keep the American Dream alive for those who stillhunger for opportunity, who still thirst for equality.Thats why Im asking you to stand with me, thats why Im asking you to caucus for me,thats why I am asking you to stop settling for what the cynics say we have to accept.In this election -- in this moment -- let us reach for what we know is possible. A nationhealed.  A world repaired. An America that believes again.Thank you very much everybody.",obama
"Thank you, Iowa.You know, they said this day would never come. They said our sights were set too high.They said this country was too divided, too disillusioned to ever come together around acommon purpose.But on this January night, at this defining moment in history, you have done what the cynicssaid we couldn't do. You have done what the state of New Hampshire can do in five days. Youhave done what America can do in this new year, 2008.In lines that stretched around schools and churches, in small towns and in big cities, youcame together as Democrats, Republicans, and independents, to stand up and say that we areone nation. We are one people. And our time for change has come.You said the time has come to move beyond the bitterness and pettiness and anger that'sconsumed Washington; to end the political strategy that's been all about division, and insteadmake it about addition; to build a coalition for change that stretches through red states andblue states; because that's how we'll win in November, and that's how we'll finally meet thechallenges that we face as a nation.We are choosing hope over fear. We're choosing unity over division, and sending a powerfulmessage that change is coming to America.You said the time has come to tell the lobbyists who think their money and their influencespeak louder than our voices that they don't own this government -- we do. And we are hereto take it back.The time has come for a President who will be honest about the choices and the challenges weface, who will listen to you and learn from you, even when we disagree, who won't just tellyou what you want to hear, but what you need to know. And in New Hampshire, if you giveme the same chance that Iowa did tonight, I will be that President for America.I'll be a President who finally makes health care affordable and available to every singleAmerican, the same way I expanded health care in Illinois, by bringing Democrats andRepublicans together to get the job done.I'll be a President who ends the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas and puta middle-class tax cut into the pockets of working Americans who deserve it.I'll be a President who harnesses the ingenuity of farmers and scientists and entrepreneurs tofree this nation from the tyranny of oil once and for all.And I'll be a President who ends this war in Iraq and finally brings our troops home, whorestores our moral standing, who understands that 9/11 is not a way to scare up votes but achallenge that should unite America and the world against the common threats of the 21stcentury -- common threats of terrorism and nuclear weapons, climate change and poverty,genocide and disease.Tonight, we are one step closer to that vision of America because of what you did here inIowa. And so I'd especially like to thank the organizers and the precinct captains, thevolunteers and the staff who made this all possible.And while I'm at it on thank you's, I think it makes sense for me to thank the love of my life,the rock of the Obama family, the closer on the campaign trail: Give it up for Michelle Obama.I know you didn't do this for me. You did this because you believed so deeply in the mostAmerican of ideas -- that in the face of impossible odds, people who love this country canchange it.I know this. I know this because while I may be standing here tonight, I'll never forget thatmy journey began on the streets of Chicago doing what so many of you have done for thiscampaign and all the campaigns here in Iowa: organizing and working and fighting to makepeople's lives just a little bit better.I know how hard it is. It comes with little sleep, little pay, and a lot of sacrifice. There aredays of disappointment. But sometimes, just sometimes, there are nights like this: a nightthat, years from now, when we've made the changes we believe in, when more families canafford to see a doctor, when our children -- when Malia and Sasha and your children inherit aplanet that's a little cleaner and safer, when the world sees America differently, and Americasees itself as a nation less divided and more united, you'll be able to look back with pride andsay that this was the moment when it all began.This was the moment when the improbable beat what Washington always said was inevitable.This was the moment when we tore down barriers that have divided us for too long; when werallied people of all parties and ages to a common cause; when we finally gave Americans whohad never participated in politics a reason to stand up and to do so.This was the moment when we finally beat back the politics of fear and doubt and cynicism,the politics where we tear each other down instead of lifting this country up. This was themoment.Years from now, you'll look back and you'll say that this was the moment, this was the placewhere America remembered what it means to hope. For many months, we've been teased,even derided for talking about hope. But we always knew that hope is not blind optimism. It'snot ignoring the enormity of the tasks ahead or the roadblocks that stand in our path.It's not sitting on the sidelines or shirking from a fight. Hope is that thing inside us thatinsists, despite all the evidence to the contrary, that something better awaits us if we havethe courage to reach for it and to work for it and to fight for it.Hope is what I saw in the eyes of the young woman in Cedar Rapids who works the night shiftafter a full day of college and still can't afford health care for a sister who's ill -- a youngwoman who still believes that this country will give her the chance to live out her dreams.Hope is what I heard in the voice of the New Hampshire woman who told me that she hasn'tbeen able to breathe since her nephew left for Iraq -- who still goes to bed each night prayingfor his safe return.Hope is what led a band of colonists to rise up against an empire, what led the greatest ofgenerations to free a continent and heal a nation, what led young women and young men tosit at lunch counters and brave fire hoses and march through Selma and Montgomery forfreedom's cause.Hope is what led me here today. With a father from Kenya, a mother from Kansas, and astory that could only happen in the United States of America.Hope is the bedrock of this nation -- the belief that our destiny will not be written for us, butby us, by all those men and women who are not content to settle for the world as it is, whohave the courage to remake the world as it should be.That is what we started here in Iowa and that is the message we can now carry to NewHampshire and beyond; the same message we had when we were up and when we weredown; the one that can save this country, brick by brick, block by block, calloused hand bycalloused hand; that together, ordinary people can do extraordinary things.Because we are not a collection of red states and blue states. We are the United States ofAmerica. And in this moment, in this election, we are ready to believe again.Thank you, Iowa.",obama
"Scripture tells us that when Joshua and the Israelites arrived at the gates of Jericho, theycould not enter. The walls of the city were too steep for any one person to climb. They weretoo strong to be taken down by brute force. And so, the people sat for days, unable to pass onthrough; but God had a plan for His People. He told them to stand together and marchtogether around the city, and on the seventh day he told them that when they heard thesound of the rams horn, they should speak with one voice. And, at the chosen hour when thehorn sounded and a chorus of voices cried out together, the mighty walls of Jericho cametumbling down. Thats what scripture tells us.And there are many lessons to take from this passage, just as there are many lessons to takefrom this day, just as there are many memories that fill the space of this church. As I wasthinking about which ones we needed to remember at this hour, my mind went back to thevery beginning of the modern Civil Rights era. Because before Memphis and the mountaintop,before the bridge in Selma and the march on Washington, before Birmingham and thebeatings, the fire hoses, and the loss of those four little girls, before there was King the iconand his magnificent dream, there was King the young preacher and a people who foundthemselves suffering under the yolk of oppression. And on the eve of the bus boycotts in Montgomery, at a time when many were still doubtful about the possibilities of change, a timewhen there were those in the black community who not only mistrusted each other, butmistrusted themselves -- King inspired with words not of anger, but of an urgency, a fierceurgency that still speaks to us today. Unity, he said, is the great need of the hour. Unityis the great need of the hour. Unity is how we shall overcome.What Dr. King understood is that if just one person chose to walk instead of ri[de] the bus,those walls of oppression would not be moved. But maybe if a few more decided to walk,those foundations might start to shake. If just a few women were willing to do what RosaParks had been willing to do, maybe the cracks in those walls would start to show. Ifteenagers took rides from North to South, maybe a few bricks would come loose. Maybe ifwhite folks marched because theyd come to understand that their freedom was wrapped up inthe freedom of others, that they too had a stake in the impending battle, the walls wouldbegin to sway, and if enough Americans were awakened to injustice, if they joined togetherNorth and South, rich and poor, Jew and Gentile, then perhaps that wall would come tumblingdown, and justice would flow like waters of righteousness, like a mighty stream. Unity is thegreat need of the hour. Thats what Dr. King said. It is the great need of this hour as well,not because it sounds pleasant, not because it makes us feel good, but because it's the onlyway we can overcome the essential deficit that exits in this country.Im not talking about the budget deficit. Im not talking about the trade deficit. Talking aboutthe moral deficit in this country. Im talking about an empathy deficit, the inability torecognize ourselves in one another, to understand that we are our brothers keeper and oursisters keeper, that in the words of Dr. King, We are all tied together in a single garment ofdestiny. We have an empathy deficit when were still sending our children down corridors ofshame, schools in the forgotten corners of America where the color of your skin still affectsthe content of your education.We have a deficit when CEOs are making more in ten minutes than ordinary workers aremaking in an entire year, when families lose their homes so unscrupulous lenders can make aprofit, when mothers cant afford a doctor when their children are stricken with illness.We have a deficit in this country when we have Scooter Libby justice for some and Jenajustice for others, when our children see hanging nooses from a school yard tree today, in thepresent, in the 21st century.We have a deficit when homeless veterans sleep on the streets of our cities, when innocentsare slaughtered in the deserts of Darfur, when young Americans serve tour after tour aftertour after tour of duty in a war that should have never been authorized and should have neverbeen waged.We have an empathy deficit in this country that has to be closed. We have a deficit when ittakes a breach in the levees to reveal the breach in our compassion, when it takes a terriblestorm to reveal the hungry that God calls on us to feed, the sick that He calls on us to carefor, the least of these that He commands that we treat as our own. So, we have a deficit toclose. We have walls, barriers to justice and equality that must come down, and to do this, weknow that unity is the great need of the hour.However, all too often, when we talk about unity in this country, weve come to believe that itcan be purchased on the cheap. Weve come to believe that racial reconciliation can comeeasily; that its just a matter of a few ignorant people trapped in the prejudices of the past,and that if the demagogues and those who would exploit our racial divisions will simply goaway then all our problems will be solved. All too often, we seek to ignore the profoundstructural and institutional barriers that stand in the way of insuring opportunity for all of ourchildren, or decent jobs for all of our people, or health care for those who are sick. We offerunity, but we are not willing to pay the price that's required  Of course, true unity cannot be so easily purchased. It starts with a change in attitudes. Itstarts with changing our hearts, and changing our minds, broadening our spirit. Its not easyto stand in somebody elses shoes. Its not easy to see past our own differences. Weve allencountered this in our own lives. What makes it even more difficult is that we have a politicsin this country that seeks to drive us apart, that puts up walls between us. We are told thatthose who differ from us on a few things, differ from us on all things, that our problems arethe fault of those who dont think like us or look like us or come from where we do. TheWelfare Queen, shes taking our money. The Immigrant, hes taking our jobs. The believercondemns the nonbeliever as immoral, and the nonbeliever chides the believer for beingintolerant.And for most of this countrys history, we in the African-American community have been atthe receiving end of mans inhumanity to man. And all of us understand insidious -- All of usunderstand intimately the insidious role that race still sometimes plays on the job and in theschools, in our health care system, and in our criminal justice system.And yet, if we are honest with ourselves, we must admit that none of our hands are entirelyclean. If were honest with ourselves, we'll acknowledge that our own community has notalways been true to Kings vision of a beloved community. If were honest with ourselves, wehave to admit that there have been times when we've scorned our gay brothers and sistersinstead of embracing them. The scourge of anti-Semitism has at times revealed itself in ourcommunity. For too long, some of us have seen immigrants only as competitors for jobsinstead of companions in the fight for opportunity. Everyday our politics fuels and exploits thiskind of division across all races and regions, across gender and party. It is played out ontelevision; it is sensationalized by the media. Last week, it crept into the campaign forPresident with charges and countercharges that serve to obscure the issues instead ofilluminating the critical choices we face as a nation. None of our hands are clean.So let us say that on this day of all days, each of us carries with us the task of changing ourhearts and minds. The divisions, the stereotypes, the scapegoating, the ease with which weblame the plight of ourselves on others -- all of that distracts us from the common challengesthat we face, war and poverty, inequality and injustice. We can no longer afford to buildourselves up by tearing each other down. We can no longer afford to traffic in lies or fear orhate. It's the poison that we must purge from our politics, the wall that we must tear downbefore the hour grows too late. Because if Dr. King could love his jailer, if he could call on thefaithful, who once sat where you do, to forgive those who had set dogs and fire hoses uponthem, then surely we can look past what divides us in our time and bind up our wounds anderase the sympathy deficit that exists in our hearts.But if changing our hearts and our minds is the first critical step, we cannot stop there. Itsnot enough to bemoan the plight of the poor in this country and remain unwilling to push ourelected officials to provide the resources to fix our schools. It's not enough to decry thedisparities of health care and yet allow the insurance companies and the drug companies toblock real reform in our health care system. Its not enough -- Its not enough for us to abhorthe costs of a misguided war, and yet we continue to allow ourselves to be driven by a politicsof fear that sees the threat of an attack as a way to scare up votes instead of a call to cometogether in a common effort.Scripture tells us that we are judged not just by word but by deed. And if we are truly to bringabout the unity that is needed, that is so crucial in this time, we have to find it withinourselves to act on what we know, to understand that living up to this countrys ideals and itspossibilities is going to require great effort and great resources, sacrifice and stamina. Wecant pass a law called No Child Left Behind and then leave the money behind. That is not aserious effort in bringing about the unity that is needed. We cant celebrate Dr. Kings dream,and yet still have insufficient funds to cash that promissory note that was promised at thebeginning of this nation.That is what is at stake in this great debate we are having today. Changes that are neededare not just a matter of tinkering around the edges. They will not come if politicians simply tellus what we want to hear. All of us will be called upon to make some sacrifice. None of us willbe exempt from responsibility. We've had to fight to fix our schools, but we also have tochallenge ourselves to be better parents, and turn off the television set, and put away thevideo game, and our men have to be home with our children. That, too, is part of thechallenge that we must make.We will have to confront the biases in our criminal justice system, but we also have toacknowledge the deep-seeded violence that still resides in our own communities, in too manyof the hearts of our young people, and we have to break the grip of that violence wherever wesee it. Thats how were going to bring about the change that we seek. Thats how Dr. King ledthis country through the wilderness.He did it with words, words that he spoke not just to the children of slaves but the children ofslave owners, words that inspired not just black but also white, not just Christian but also Jewand Muslim and Buddhists and Atheists, not just the southerner but also the northerner. Heled with words, but he also led with deeds. He also led by example. He led by marching andgoing to jail and suffering threats and beatings and being away from his family. He led bytaking a stand against a war knowing full well that it would diminish his popularity. He led bychallenging our economic structures, understanding that it would cause discomfort. Dr. Kingunderstood that unity cannot be won on the cheap, that we would have to earn it throughgreat effort and determination. Thats the unity, the hard earned unity that we need rightnow. That is the effort, the determination that can transform blind optimism into hope.You know people have remarked on the fact that I talk about hope a lot in my campaign. Youknow they -- they tease me a little bit. Some have been scornful. They say, Ah, hes talkingabout hope again. Hes so idealistic. Hes so nave. Hes a hope monger. Thats okay. Itstrue. I talk about hope. I talk about it a lot because the odds of me standing here today are sosmall, so remote that I couldnt of gotten here without some hope. You know my -- my daddyleft me when I was two years old. I needed some hope to get here. I was raised by a singlemother. I needed some hope to get here. I got in trouble when I was a teenager, did somethings folks now like to talk about. I needed some hope to get here. I wasnt born into money,or great wealth, or great privilege, or status. I was given love, an education, and some hope.Thats what I got. Thats my birthright.So I talk about hope. I -- I put Hope on my campaign signs. It doesnt even have my nameon them sometimes -- just says Hope. Folks dont know who theyre voting for, but it makesthem feel good. Say, you know, huh? I spoke about hope at the Democratic Convention. I -- Iwrote a book called The Audacity of Hope. And so I -- so Im puzzled when -- when somepeople, some of the other candidates make a mockery of the idea. They say Im pedaling falsehopes. ""Get a reality check,"" they tell me. And I have to -- I have to try to understand whatthey're saying. The implication is is that if you are hopeful, that you somehow must beengaging in wishful thinking. Your -- Your head must be in the clouds; that you must bepassive and just sit back and wait for things to happen to you. That seems to be theimplication.And so I have to explain to people thats not what hope is. Hope is not blind optimism. Hope isnot ignorance of the barriers and hurdles and hazards that stand in your way. Hopes just theopposite. I know how hard it will be to provide health care to every single American. Theinsurance companies, drug companies, they dont want to give up their profits. I know it wontbe easy to have a energy policy that makes sense for America because the oil companies likewriting the energy bills. I know that alleviating poverty, or making sure all our children canlearn, or eliminating the scourge of racism in our society -- none of those things lendthemselves to simple solutions.I know because I fought on the streets as a community organizer in poor neighborhoods onthe Southside of Chicago alongside those without jobs or without prospects for the future. Ihave fought in the courts as a civil rights attorney for those who had been denied opportunityon the job or denied access to the ballot box. Ive seen good legislation die because -- Well,Ive seen that too -- Ive seen good legislation die because good intentions werent enough,because they werent fortified with a political majority and political will. Ive seen this country-- this countrys judgment clouded by fear. I know how easily a country can be misled when itis afraid. I know how hard it is. Everybody here understands how difficult it is to bring abouttrue change, change that we can believe in. But I also know this -- that nothing in this countryworthwhile has ever happened except somebody somewhere decided to hope.Thats how this country was founded because a group of patriots decided they were going totake on the British Empire. Nobody was putting their money on them. Thats how slaves andabolitionists resisted that evil system. Thats how a new President was able to chart a courseto insure that this nation would no longer remain half slave and half free. Thats how thegreatest generation defeated Fascism and overcame a Great Depression. Thats how womenwon the right to vote. Thats how workers won the right to organize. Thats how young peopleand old people and middle-aged folks were willing to walk instead of ride the bus, and folkscame down on Freedom Rides. They marched, and they sat in, and they were beaten and firehouses were sent on them, and dogs were sent on them, and some went to jail, and somedied for freedom's cause. Thats what hope is. Imagining and then fighting for and strugglingfor and sometimes dying for what didnt seem possible before. Theres nothing nave aboutthat. There are no false hopes in that.I dont believe in false hopes. Imagine if John F. Kennedy had looked up at the moon andsaid, ""Well, thats too far."" False hopes, we cant go there. If Dr. King had stood on the LincolnMemorial and said, ""Yall go home; we cant overcome."" Theres no such thing as false hopes,but what I know deep in my heart is that we cannot bring about change unless we are unified,unless we do it together. Change does not happen from the top down -- in America oranywhere else. It happens from the bottom up. It happens because ordinary people dreamextraordinary things. Its because all of you decide that change must come. That I know.It wasnt just one voice -- It wasn't just one voice that shouted out before the walls of Jericho.All the voices came together, a chorus of voices. Thats what gives me hope: not just thosewho ascend to high office, but the changes that are happening in ordinary places. The storiesthat give me my hope dont happen in the spotlight. When I think about Dr. King, I suspect hewas sustained not by having dinner with Presidents; not by getting the Nobel Peace Prize; butcoming back to church and seeing the mothers of the church and the deacons. Those whomaintained their dignity were standing up straight in the face of injustice. Thats where hedrew his hope. He saw God in their faces. Those stories dont happen on a presidential stage;they happen in the quiet quarters of our lives. They happen in the moments we least expect.So, let me close by giving an example of one of those stories.There is a young woman, 23 years old, white woman, named Ashley Baia, who organizes forour campaign in Florence, South Carolina. Ashley has been working to organize mostly blackfolks. Shes in Florence, South Carolina. Shes been doing it since the beginning of thecampaign, and the other day she...set up a round table discussion where everyone aroundwas telling their story about who they were and why they were there. And so, Ashleyexplained, she started things off, by explaining why she was there. And she explained thatwhen she was nine years old her mother got cancer, and because she had to miss a day ofwork she was let go; and she lost her health care; and then she had to file for bankruptcy.They were on hard times, and thats when Ashley, nine-years-old at the time, decided she hadto do something to help her mom, and she knew that food was one of their most expensivecosts. They didnt have a lot of money. Ashley lived in a poor household.And so Ashley convinced her mother that she really liked and really wanted to eat more thananything else mustard and relish sandwiches. She had heard that condiments like mustardand relish were cheap. And she -- she concocted in her own mind at the age of nine that shewould convince her mother that thats the only thing she wanted to eat everyday, because shefigured that would be a way of saving money for the family and helping them alleviate theirhardships. So she did this for a year until her mom got better. And in that round table she toldeveryone that the reason she joined our campaign was so that she could help millions of otherchildren in the country who want and need to help their parents too. She had heard me speakabout my mother having cancer and having to worry about maybe not getting the health careshe needed because of a preexisting condition, and she had connected with that. She thought,maybe Barack would fight for my mother. And if he would fight for my mother, then maybe Iwill fight alongside him. Thats what had brought her to Florence.So Ashley finishes her story and then goes around the room and asks everyone else whytheyre supporting the campaign. They all have different stories and different reasons: somebring up specific issues; some talk about, upset about, affirmative action; some talk about,you know, ""I want to see more jobs in the community""; some are frustrated about trade;some just like me.So they all got a bunch of different reasons, and finally, at the end of this discussion, theycome to this elderly black man. Hes been sitting there quiet the whole time, hasnt beensaying a word. And Ashley asks him why is he there. And he doesnt bring up a specific issue.He does not say healthcare or the economy. He doesnt talk about the Iraq War. He doesntsay anything about education. He doesnt say that hes there because he likes Barack Obama,or hes proud of the possibility of the first African American President. He simply says toeveryone in the room, I am here because of Ashley. I am here because of this young girl,and the fact that she's willing to fight for what she believes in. And that reminds me that I stillhave some fight left in me, and Im going stand up for what I believe in.Now, by itself, that single moment of recognition between that young white girl and that oldblack man, thats not enough to change a country. By itself, its not enough to give healthcare to the sick or jobs to the jobless or education to our children, but it is where we begin.Its why I believe that the walls in that room began to shake at that moment. And if they canshake in that room, then they can shake here in Atlanta, and if they can shake in Atlanta,then they can shake in the state of Georgia, and if they can shake in Georgia, they can shakeall across America. And if enough of our voices join together, if we see each other in eachothers eyes, we can bring those walls tumbling down. The walls of Jericho can finally cometumbling down.That is our hope, but only if we pray together, if we work together, and if we march together.Ebenezer, we cannot walk alone. Brothers and sisters, we cannot walk alone. In the strugglefor justice and for equality, we cannot walk alone. In the struggle for opportunity and justice,we cannot walk alone. In the struggle to heal this nation and repair the world, we cannot walkalone. So I ask you to walk with me and march with me and join your voices with mine, andtogether we will sing the song that tears down the walls that divide us and lift up an Americathat is truly indivisible with liberty and justice for all.May God bless the memory of the great pastor of this church.And may God bless the United States of America.Thank you. Thank you.",obama
"Let me begin by thanking Harris Wofford for his contributions to this country. In so manydifferent ways, he exemplifies what we mean by the word ""citizen."" And so we are verygrateful to him for all the work he has done; and I'm thankful for the gracious and thoughtfulintroduction.""We the people, in order to form a more perfect union."" Two hundred and twenty one yearsago, in a hall that still stands across the street, a group of men gathered and, with thesesimple words, launched America's improbable experiment in democracy. Farmers andscholars, statesmen and patriots who had traveled across the ocean to escape tyranny andpersecution finally made real their Declaration of Independence at a Philadelphia conventionthat lasted through the spring of 1787.The document they produced was eventually signed, but ultimately unfinished. It was stainedby this nation's original sin of slavery, a question that divided the colonies and brought theconvention to a stalemate until the founders chose to allow the slave trade to continue for atleast 20 more years, and to leave any final resolution to future generations. Of course, theanswer to the slavery question was already embedded within our Constitution -- aConstitution that had at is very core the ideal of equal citizenship under the law; aConstitution that promised its people liberty and justice, and a union that could be and shouldbe perfected over time.And yet words on a parchment would not be enough to deliver slaves from bondage, orprovide men and women of every color and creed their full rights and obligations as citizens ofthe United States. What would be needed were Americans in successive generations who werewilling to do their part -- through protests and struggles, on the streets and in the courts,through a civil war and civil disobedience, and always at great risk -- to narrow that gapbetween the promise of our ideals and the reality of their time.This was one of the tasks we set forth at the beginning of this presidential campaign: tocontinue the long march of those who came before us, a march for a more just, more equal,more free, more caring, and more prosperous America. I chose to run for President at thismoment in history because I believe deeply that we cannot solve the challenges of our timeunless we solve them together, unless we perfect our union by understanding that we mayhave different stories, but we hold common hopes; that we may not look the same and maynot have come from the same place, but we all want to move in the same direction: towards abetter future for our children and our grandchildren. And this belief comes from my unyieldingfaith in the decency and generosity of the American people. But it also comes from my ownstory.I'm the son of a black man from Kenya and a white woman from Kansas. I was raised with thehelp of a white grandfather who survived a Depression to serve in Patton's army during WorldWar II, and a white grandmother who worked on a bomber assembly line at Fort Leavenworthwhile he was overseas. I've gone to some of the best schools in America and I've lived in oneof the world's poorest nations. I am married to a black American who carries within her theblood of slaves and slave owners, an inheritance we pass on to our two precious daughters. Ihave brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews, uncles, and cousins of every race and every huescattered across three continents. And for as long as I live, I will never forget that in no othercountry on earth is my story even possible. It's a story that hasn't made me the mostconventional of candidates. But it is a story that has seared into my genetic makeup the ideathat this nation is more than the sum of its parts -- that out of many, we are truly one.Now throughout the first year of this campaign, against all predictions to the contrary, we sawhow hungry the American people were for this message of unity. Despite the temptation toview my candidacy through a purely racial lens, we won commanding victories in states withsome of the whitest populations in the country. In South Carolina, where the Confederate flagstill flies, we built a powerful coalition of African Americans and white Americans. This is not tosay that race has not been an issue in this campaign. At various stages in the campaign, somecommentators have deemed me either ""too black"" or ""not black enough."" We saw racialtensions bubble to the surface during the week before the South Carolina primary. The presshas scoured every single exit poll for the latest evidence of racial polarization, not just interms of white and black, but black and brown as well.And yet, it's only been in the last couple of weeks that the discussion of race in this campaignhas taken a particularly divisive turn. On one end of the spectrum, we've heard the implicationthat my candidacy is somehow an exercise in affirmative action; that it's based solely on thedesire of wild and wide-eyed liberals to purchase racial reconciliation on the cheap. On theother end, we've heard my former pastor, Jeremiah Wright, use incendiary language toexpress views that have the potential not only to widen the racial divide, but views thatdenigrate both the greatness and the goodness of our nation and that rightly offend white andblack alike.Now I've already condemned, in unequivocal terms, the statements of Reverend Wright thathave caused such controversy, and in some cases, pain. For some, nagging questions remain:Did I know him to be an occasionally fierce critic of American domestic and foreign policy? Ofcourse. Did I ever hear him make remarks that could be considered controversial while I sat inthe church? Yes. Did I strongly disagree with many of his political views? Absolutely, just asI'm sure many of you have heard remarks from your pastors, priests, or rabbis with which youstrongly disagree.But the remarks that have caused this recent firestorm weren't simply controversial. Theyweren't simply a religious leader's efforts to speak out against perceived injustice. Instead,they expressed a profoundly distorted view of this country, a view that sees white racism asendemic and that elevates what is wrong with America above all that we know is right withAmerica; a view that sees the conflicts in the Middle East as rooted primarily in the actions ofstalwart allies like Israel instead of emanating from the perverse and hateful ideologies ofradical Islam.As such, Reverend Wright's comments were not only wrong but divisive, divisive at a timewhen we need unity; racially charged at a time when we need to come together to solve a setof monumental problems: two wars, a terrorist threat, a falling economy, a chronic healthcare crisis, and potentially devastating climate change -- problems that are neither black orwhite or Latino or Asian, but rather problems that confront us all.Given my background, my politics, and my professed values and ideals, there will no doubt bethose for whom my statements of condemnation are not enough. Why associate myself withReverend Wright in the first place, they may ask? Why not join another church? And I confessthat if all that I knew of Reverend Wright were the snippets of those sermons that have run inan endless loop on the television sets and YouTube, if Trinity United Church of Christconformed to the caricatures being peddled by some commentators, there is no doubt that Iwould react in much the same way. But the truth is, that isn't all that I know of the man. The man I met more than twenty yearsago is a man who helped introduce me to my Christian faith, a man who spoke to me aboutour obligations to love one another, to care for the sick and lift up the poor.He is a man who served his country as a United States Marine, and who has studied andlectured at some of the finest universities and seminaries in the country, and who over 30years has led a church that serves the community by doing God's work here on Earth -- byhousing the homeless, ministering to the needy, providing day care services and scholarshipsand prison ministries, and reaching out to those suffering from HIV/AIDS.In my first book, Dreams From My Father, I described the experience of my first service atTrinity, and it goes as follows:People began to shout, to rise from their seats and clap and cry out, a forceful windcarrying the reverend's voice up to the rafters.And in that single note -- hope -- I heard something else; at the foot of that cross,inside the thousands of churches across the city, I imagined the stories of ordinaryblack people merging with the stories of David and Goliath, Moses and Pharaoh, theChristians in the lion's den, Ezekiel's field of dry bones.Those stories of survival and freedom and hope became our stories, my story. Theblood that spilled was our blood; the tears our tears; until this black church, on thisbright day, seemed once more a vessel carrying the story of a people into futuregenerations and into a larger world. Our trials and triumphs became at once uniqueand universal, black and more than black. In chronicling our journey, the stories andsongs gave us a meaning to reclaim memories that we didn't need to feel shame about-- memories that all people might study and cherish and with which we could start torebuild.That has been my experience at Trinity. Like other predominantly black churches across thecountry, Trinity embodies the black community in its entirety -- the doctor and the welfaremom, the model student and the former gang-banger. Like other black churches, Trinity'sservices are full of raucous laughter and sometimes bawdy humor. They are full of dancingand clapping and screaming and shouting that may seem jarring to the untrained ear. Thechurch contains in full the kindness and cruelty, the fierce intelligence and the shockingignorance, the struggles and successes, the love and, yes, the bitterness and biases thatmake up the black experience in America.And this helps explain, perhaps, my relationship with Reverend Wright. As imperfect as hemay be, he has been like family to me. He strengthens my faith, officiated my wedding, andbaptized my children. Not once in my conversations with him have I heard him talk about anyethnic group in derogatory terms or treat whites with whom he interacted with anything butcourtesy and respect. He contains within him the contradictions -- the good and the bad -- ofthe community that he has served diligently for so many years.I can no more disown him than I can disown the black community. I can no more disown himthan I can disown my white grandmother, a woman who helped raise me, a woman whosacrificed again and again for me, a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything inthis world, but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed her by on thestreet, and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that mademe cringe.These people are part of me. And they are part of America, this country that I love.Now, some will see this as an attempt to justify or excuse comments that are simplyinexcusable. I can assure you it is not. And I suppose the politically safe thing to do would beto move on from this episode and just hope that it fades into the woodwork. We can dismissReverend Wright as a crank or a demagogue, just as some have dismissed Geraldine Ferraroin the aftermath of her recent statements as harboring some deep -- deep-seated bias.But race is an issue that I believe this nation cannot afford to ignore right now. We would bemaking the same mistake that Reverend Wright made in his offending sermons aboutAmerica: to simplify and stereotype and amplify the negative to the point that it distortsreality. The fact is that the comments that have been made and the issues that have surfacedover the last few weeks reflect the complexities of race in this country that we've never reallyworked through, a part of our union that we have not yet made perfect. And if we walk awaynow, if we simply retreat into our respective corners, we will never be able to come togetherand solve challenges like health care or education or the need to find good jobs for everyAmerican.Understanding -- Understanding this reality requires a reminder of how we arrived at thispoint. As William Faulkner once wrote, ""The past isn't dead and buried. In fact, it isn't evenpast."" We do not need to recite here the history of racial injustice in this country. But we doneed to remind ourselves that so many of the disparities that exist between the African-American community and the larger American community today can be traced directly toinequalities passed on from an earlier generation that suffered under the brutal legacy ofslavery and Jim Crow. Segregated schools were, and are, inferior schools. We still haven'tfixed them, 50 years after Brown versus Board of Education. And the inferior education theyprovided, then and now, helps explain the pervasive achievement gap between today's blackand white students.Legalized discrimination, where blacks were prevented, often through violence, from owningproperty, or loans were not granted to African-American business owners, or blackhomeowners could not access FHA mortgages, or blacks were excluded from unions, or thepolice force, or the fire department meant that black families could not amass any meaningfulwealth to bequeath to future generations. That history helps explain the wealth and incomegap between blacks and whites and the concentrated pockets of poverty that persist in somany of today's urban and rural communities.A lack of economic opportunity among black men and the shame and frustration that camefrom not being able to provide for one's family contributed to the erosion of black families, aproblem that welfare policies for many years may have worsened. And the lack of basicservices in so many urban black neighborhoods -- parks for kids to play in, police walking thebeat, regular garbage pick-up, building code enforcement -- all helped create a cycle ofviolence, blight, and neglect that continues to haunt us.This is the reality in which Reverend Wright and other African-Americans of his generationgrew up. They came of age in the late '50s and early '60s, a time when segregation was stillthe law of the land and opportunity was systematically constricted. What's remarkable is nothow many failed in the face of discrimination, but how many men and women overcame theodds, how many were able to make a way out of no way for those like me who would comeafter them. But for all those who scratched and clawed their way to get a piece of the American Dream,there were many who didn't make it -- those who were ultimately defeated, in one way oranother, by discrimination. That legacy of defeat was passed on to future generations -- thoseyoung men and increasingly young women who we see standing on street corners orlanguishing in our prisons, without hope or prospects for the future. Even for those blacks whodid make it, questions of race, and racism, continue to define their world view in fundamentalways. For the men and women of Reverend Wright's generation, the memories of humiliationand doubt and fear have not gone away, nor has the anger and the bitterness of those years.That anger may not get expressed in public, in front of white co-workers or white friends, butit does find voice in the barbershop or the beauty shop or around the kitchen table. At times,that anger is exploited by politicians to gin up votes along racial lines or to make up for apolitician's own failings. And occasionally it finds voice in the church on Sunday morning, inthe pulpit and in the pews. The fact that so many people are surprised to hear that anger insome of Reverend Wright's sermons simply reminds us of that old truism that the mostsegregated hour of American life occurs on Sunday morning.That -- That anger is not always productive. Indeed, all too often it distracts attention fromsolving real problems. It keeps us from squarely facing our own complicity within the African-American community in our own condition. It prevents the African-American community fromforging the alliances it needs to bring about real change. But the anger is real; it is powerful,and to simply wish it away, to condemn it without understanding its roots only serves towiden the chasm of misunderstanding that exists between the races.In fact, a similar anger exists within segments of the white community. Most working andmiddle-class white Americans don't feel that they've been particularly privileged by their race.Their experience is the immigrant experience. As far as they're concerned, no one handedthem anything; they built it from scratch. They've worked hard all their lives, many times onlyto see their jobs shipped overseas or their pensions dumped after a lifetime of labor. They areanxious about their futures, and they feel their dreams slipping away.And in an era of stagnant wages and global competition, opportunity comes to be seen as azero sum game, in which your dreams come at my expense. So when they are told to bustheir children to a school across town, when they hear that an African American is getting anadvantage in landing a good job or a spot in a good college because of an injustice that theythemselves never committed, when they're told that their fears about crime in urbanneighborhoods are somehow prejudice, resentment builds over time. Like the anger within the black community, these resentments aren't always expressed inpolite company. But they have helped shape the political landscape for at least a generation.Anger over welfare and affirmative action helped forge the Reagan Coalition. Politiciansroutinely exploited fears of crime for their own electoral ends. Talk show hosts andconservative commentators built entire careers unmasking bogus claims of racism whiledismissing legitimate discussions of racial injustice and inequality as mere political correctnessor reverse racism. And just as black anger often proved counterproductive, so have thesewhite resentments distracted attention from the real culprits of the middle class squeeze: acorporate culture rife with inside dealing, questionable accounting practices, and short-termgreed; a Washington dominated by lobbyists and special interests; economic policies thatfavor the few over the many. And yet, to wish away the resentments of white Americans, tolabel them as misguided or even racist without recognizing they are grounded in legitimateconcerns, this, too, widens the racial divide and blocks the path to understanding.This is where we are right now.It's a racial stalemate we've been stuck in for years. And contrary to the claims of some of mycritics, black and white, I have never been so naive as to believe that we can get beyond ourracial divisions in a single election cycle or with a single candidate, particularly -- particularly acandidacy as imperfect as my own. But I have asserted a firm conviction, a conviction rootedin my faith in God and my faith in the American people, that, working together, we can movebeyond some of our old racial wounds and that, in fact, we have no choice -- we have nochoice if we are to continue on the path of a more perfect union. For the African-American community, that path means embracing the burdens of our pastwithout becoming victims of our past. It means continuing to insist on a full measure of justicein every aspect of American life. But it also means binding our particular grievances, for betterhealth care and better schools and better jobs, to the larger aspirations of all Americans -- thewhite woman struggling to break the glass ceiling, the white man who's been laid off, theimmigrant trying to feed his family. And it means also taking full responsibility for our ownlives -- by demanding more from our fathers, and spending more time with our children, andreading to them, and teaching them that while they may face challenges and discrimination intheir own lives, they must never succumb to despair or cynicism. They must always believe --They must always believe that they can write their own destiny.Ironically, this quintessentially American -- and, yes, conservative -- notion of self-help foundfrequent expression in Reverend Wright's sermons. But what my former pastor too often failedto understand is that embarking on a program of self-help also requires a belief that societycan change. The profound mistake of Reverend Wright's sermons is not that he spoke aboutracism in our society. It's that he spoke as if our society was static, as if no progress had beenmade, as if this country -- a country that has made it possible for one of his own members torun for the highest office in the land and build a coalition of white and black, Latino, Asian,rich, poor, young and old -- is still irrevocably bound to a tragic past. What we know, what wehave seen, is that America can change. That is true genius of this nation. What we havealready achieved gives us hope -- the audacity to hope -- for what we can and must achievetomorrow.Now, in the white community, the path to a more perfect union means acknowledging thatwhat ails the African-American community does not just exist in the minds of black people;that the legacy of discrimination -- and current incidents of discrimination, while less overtthan in the past -- that these things are real and must be addressed. Not just with words, butwith deeds -- by investing in our schools and our communities; by enforcing our civil rightslaws and ensuring fairness in our criminal justice system; by providing this generation withladders of opportunity that were unavailable for previous generations. It requires allAmericans to realize that your dreams do not have to come at the expense of my dreams,that investing in the health, welfare, and education of black and brown and white children willultimately help all of America prosper.In the end, then, what is called for is nothing more and nothing less than what all the world'sgreat religions demand: that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us. Let us beour brother's keeper, Scripture tells us. Let us be our sister's keeper. Let us find that commonstake we all have in one another, and let our politics reflect that spirit as well.For we have a choice in this country. We can accept a politics that breeds division and conflictand cynicism. We can tackle race only as spectacle, as we did in the O.J. trial; or in the wakeof tragedy, as we did in the aftermath of Katrina; or as fodder for the nightly news. We canplay Reverend Wright's sermons on every channel every day and talk about them from nowuntil the election, and make the only question in this campaign whether or not the Americanpeople think that I somehow believe or sympathize with his most offensive words. We canpounce on some gaffe by a Hillary supporter as evidence that she's playing the race card; orwe can speculate on whether white men will all flock to John McCain in the general electionregardless of his policies. We can do that. But if we do, I can tell you that in the next election,we'll be talking about some other distraction, and then another one, and then another one.And nothing will change.That is one option.Or, at this moment, in this election, we can come together and say, ""Not this time."" This timewe want to talk about the crumbling schools that are stealing the future of black children andwhite children and Asian children and Hispanic children and Native-American children. Thistime we want to reject the cynicism that tells us that these kids can't learn; that those kidswho don't look like us are somebody else's problem. The children of America are not ""thosekids,"" -- they are our kids, and we will not let them fall behind in a 21st-century economy. Notthis time. This time we want to talk about how the lines in the emergency room are filled withwhites and blacks and Hispanics who do not have health care, who don't have the power ontheir own to overcome the special interests in Washington, but who can take them on if we doit together.This time we want to talk about the shuttered mills that once provided a decent life for menand women of every race, and the homes for sale that once belonged to Americans fromevery religion, every region, every walk of life. This time we want to talk about the fact thatthe real problem is not that someone who doesn't look like you might take your job; it's thatthe corporation you work for will ship it overseas for nothing more than a profit. This time --This time we want to talk about the men and women of every color and creed who servetogether, and fight together, and bleed together under the same proud flag. We want to talkabout how to bring them home from a war that should've never been authorized andshould've never been waged. And we want to talk about how we'll show our patriotism bycaring for them, and their families, and giving them the benefits that they have earned.I would not be running for President if I didn't believe with all my heart that this is what thevast majority of Americans want for this country. This union may never be perfect, butgeneration after generation has shown that it can always be perfected. And today, whenever Ifind myself feeling doubtful or cynical about this possibility, what gives me the most hope isthe next generation -- the young people whose attitudes and beliefs and openness to changehave already made history in this election.There's one story in particular that I'd like to leave you with today, a story I told when I hadthe great honor of speaking on Dr. King's birthday at his home church, Ebenezer Baptist, inAtlanta. There's a young, 23-year-old woman, a white woman named Ashley Baia, whoorganized for our campaign in Florence, South Carolina. She'd been working to organize amostly African-American community since the beginning of this campaign, and one day shewas at a roundtable discussion where everyone went around telling their story and why theywere there. And Ashley said that when she was 9 years old, her mother got cancer. Andbecause she had to miss days of work, she was let go and lost her health care. They had tofile for bankruptcy, and that's when Ashley decided that she had to do something to help hermom. She knew that food was one of their most expensive costs, and so Ashley convinced hermother that what she really liked and really wanted to eat more than anything else wasmustard and relish sandwiches -- because that was the cheapest way to eat. That's the mindof a 9 year old.She did this for a year until her mom got better. And so Ashley told everyone at theroundtable that the reason she had joined our campaign was so that she could help themillions of other children in the country who want and need to help their parents too. Now, Ashley might have made a different choice. Perhaps somebody told her along the waythat the source of her mother's problems were blacks who were on welfare and too lazy towork, or Hispanics who were coming into the country illegally. But she didn't. She sought outallies in her fight against injustice. Anyway, Ashley finishes her story and then goes around the room and asks everyone else whythey're supporting the campaign. They all have different stories and different reasons. Manybring up a specific issue. And finally they come to this elderly black man who's been sittingthere quietly the entire time. And Ashley asks him why he's there. And he doesn't bring up aspecific issue. He does not say health care or the economy. He does not say education or thewar. He does not say that he was there because of Barack Obama. He simply says toeveryone in the room, ""I am here because of Ashley."" ""I'm here because of Ashley."" Now, by itself, that single moment of recognition between that young white girl and that oldblack man is not enough. It is not enough to give health care to the sick, or jobs to thejobless, or education to our children. But it is where we start. It is where our union growsstronger. And as so many generations have come to realize over the course of the 221 yearssince a band of patriots signed that document right here in Philadelphia, that is whereperfection begins. Thank you very much, everyone. Thank you.",obama

"Thank you very much, Madam President. And thank you to the distinguished Senator fromConnecticut not only for yielding time, but also for the extraordinarily hard work that he's putin over the last several days and, in fact, over a -- a week. And I want to thank hiscounterparts on the other side, including Senator Gregg, for their hard work.Now, the fact that we're even here voting on a plan to rescue our economy from the greedand irresponsibility of Wall Street and some in Washington is an outrage. It's an outrage toevery American who works hard, pays their taxes, is doing their best every day to make abetter life for themselves and their families. And understandably, people are frustrated andthey're angry that Wall Street's mistakes have put their tax dollars at risk. And they shouldbe. I'm frustrated and angry, too.But while there's plenty of blame to go around -- and many in Washington and Wall Streetwho deserve it, all of us -- all of us have a responsibility to solve this crisis, because it affectsthe financial well-being of every single American. There will be time to punish those who setthis fire, but now is not the time to argue about how it got set, or did the neighbor sleep in hisbed, or leave the stove on. Right now we want to put out that fire; and now's the time for usto come together and do that.When the House of Representatives failed to act on Monday, we saw the single largest declinein the stock market in two decades. Over one trillion dollars of wealth was lost by the time themarkets closed. And it wasn't just the wealth of a few CEOs or Wall Street executives. The401(k)s and retirement accounts of millions became smaller. The state pension funds ofteachers and government employees lost billions upon billions of dollars. Hard-workingAmericans who invested their nest egg to watch it grow saw it diminish and in some casesdisappear.And while that decline was devastating, the consequences of the credit crisis that caused itwill be even worse if we do not act now. We're in a very dangerous situation, where financialinstitutions across this country are afraid to lend money. And if all that meant was the failureof a few banks in New York, that would be one thing. But that's not what it means. What itmeans is, if we don't act, it will be harder for Americans to get a mortgage for their home orloans they need to buy a car or send their children to college.What it means is that businesses won't be able to get the loans they need to open a newfactory or make payroll for their workers. And if they can't make payroll on Friday, thenworkers are laid off on Monday. And if workers are laid off on Monday, then they can't paytheir bills or pay back their loans to somebody else. And it will go on and on and on, ripplingthrough the entire economy. And potentially we could see thousands of businesses close,millions of jobs could be lost, and a long and painful recession could follow. In other words,this is not just a Wall Street crisis; it's an American crisis. And it's the American economy thatneeds this rescue plan.I understand completely why people would be skeptical when this President asks for a blankcheck to solve this problem. I was, too, as was Senator Dodd and a whole bunch of us here.And that's why, over a week ago, I demanded that this plan include some specific proposals toprotect taxpayers, protections that the Administration eventually agreed to, and, thanks to thehard work of Senator Dodd and Republican counterparts like Senator Gregg, we here in theSenate have agreed to, and now hopefully the House will agree to, as well.Let me just go over those principles:Number one, I said we needed an independent board to provide oversight andaccountability for how and where this money is spent at every step of the way.Number two, I said that we cannot help banks on Wall Street without helping themillions of innocent homeowners who are struggling to stay in their homes. Theydeserve a plan, too.Number three, I said that I would not allow this plan to become a welfare program forWall Street executives, whose greed and irresponsibility got us into this mess.And, finally, I said that, if American taxpayers are financing this solution, then theyhave to be treated like investors. They should get every penny of their tax dollars backonce the economy recovers.Now, this last part is important, because it's been the most misunderstood and poorlycommunicated part of this plan. This is not a plan to just hand over 700 billion dollars oftaxpayer money to a few banks. If this is managed correctly -- and that's an important ""if"" --we will hopefully get most or all of our money back and possibly even turn a profit on thegovernment's intervention, every penny of which will go directly back to the American people.And if we fall short, we will levy a fee on financial institutions so that they can repay for thelosses that they caused.Now, let me -- let's acknowledge, even with all these taxpayer protections, this plan is notperfect. Democrats and Republicans in Congress have legitimate concerns about it. Some ofmy closest colleagues, people I have the greatest respect for, still have problems with it andmay choose to vote against this bill, and I think that we can respectfully disagree. Iunderstand their frustrations.I also know that many -- many Americans share their concerns. But it's clear that, from myperspective, this is what we need to do right now to prevent the possibility of a crisis turninginto a catastrophe. It is conceivable -- it's possible that if we did nothing everything wouldturn out okay. It's -- There -- There's a possibility that that's true. And there's no doubt thatthere may be other plans out there that, had we had two or three or six months to develop,might be even more refined and might serve our purposes better.But we don't have that kind of time. And we can't afford to take a risk that the economy ofthe United States of America and, as a consequence, the worldwide economy could beplunged into a very, very deep hole. So to Democrats and Republicans who've opposed thisplan, I say: Step up to the plate. Let's do what's right for the country at this time, becausethe time to act is now.I know many Americans are wondering what happens next. And passing this bill can't be theend of our work to strengthen our economy; it must be the beginning. Because one thing I --I think all of us who may end up supporting this bill understand is that, even if we get this inplace, we could still have enormous problems and probably will have big problems in theeconomy over the next several months and potentially longer; because the fact is, is that wehave seen some mismanagement of the fundamentals of the economy for a very long time,and we are not going to dig ourselves out of that hole immediately.So this is not the end. This is the beginning. As soon as we pass this rescue plan, we need tomove aggressively with the same sense of urgency to rescue families on Main Street who arestruggling to pay their bills and keep their jobs. They've been in crisis a lot longer than WallStreet has.I've said it before and I say it again: We need to pass an economic stimulus package that willhelp ordinary Americans cope with rising food and gas prices, that can save one million jobsrebuilding our schools, and roads, and our infrastructure, and help states and cities avoidbudget cuts and tax increase[s], a -- a plan that would extend expiring unemploymentbenefits for those Americans who've lost their jobs and cannot find new ones. That's the rightthing to do at a time when consumer confidence is down and we are in great danger ofslipping into a big recession.We also must do more in this rescue package in order to help homeowners stay in theirhomes. I will continue to advocate bankruptcy reforms. I know my colleague from Illinois,Dick Durbin, has been a strong champion of this, as have many. It is the right thing to do tochange our bankruptcy laws so that people have a better chance of staying in their homes andwe're not seeing communities devastated all across the country. And we should encourageTreasury to study the option of buying individual mortgages, like we did successfully in the1930s.And finally, while we all hope that this rescue package succeeds, we should be prepared totake more vigorous actions in the months ahead to rebuild capital, if it's necessary.Now, just as families are planning for their future in tough times, Washington's going to haveto do the same. Runaway spending and record deficits are not how families run their budgets.It can't be how Washington handles people's tax dollars. So we're going to have to return tothe fiscal responsibility we had in the 1990s. And the next White House and the next Congressis going to have to work together to make sure that we go through our budget, we get rid ofprograms that don't work, that we make the ones that do work better and cost less. With lessmoney flowing into the Treasury, some useful programs or policies might need to be delayed.And some might be -- need to be stretched out over a longer period of time.But there are certain investments in our future that we cannot delay, precisely because oureconomy is in turmoil.Mr. President, I've exceeded the time a little bit. I would like unanimous consent for a couplemore minutes.Senate President: Is there objection? Seeing no objection -- Senator Obama: Thank you.There are certain investments in our future that we can't delay precisely be -- because theeconomy's in turmoil. We can't wait to help Americans keep up with rising costs and shrinkingpaychecks, and we're going to do that by making sure that we are giving our workers amiddle-class tax cut.We can't wait to relieve the burden of crushing health care costs. We can't wait to createmillions of new jobs by rebuilding our roads and our bridges, and investing in broadband linesin rural communities, and fixing our electricity grid so we can get renewable energy topopulation centers that need them. And we need to develop an energy policy that prevents usfrom sending 700 billion dollars a year to tyrants and dictators for their oil. We can't wait toeducate the next generation of Americans with the skills and knowledge they need to competewith any workers anywhere in the world. These are the priorities we cannot delay.Now, let me just close by saying this: I do not think this is going to be easy. It's not going tocome without costs. We are all going to need to sacrifice. We're all going to need to pull ourweight, because now, more than ever, we are all in this together. That's part of what thiscrisis has taught us -- that in the end of the day, there's no real separation between WallStreet and Main Street. There's only the road we're traveling on as Americans. And we willrise or fall on that journey as one nation and as one people.I know that many Americans are feeling anxiety right now about their jobs, about theirhomes, about their life savings. But I also know this, that we can steer ourselves out of thiscrisis. We are -- always have. During the great financial crisis of the last century, in his firstfireside chat, FDR told his fellow Americans that, There is an element in the re-adjustment of our financial system more important thancurrency, more important than gold, and that is the confidence of the peoplethemselves. Confidence and courage are the essentials of success in carrying out ourplan.Let us unite in banishing fear. Together we cannot fail. We cannot fail, not now, not tomorrow,not next year.This is a nation that's faced down war and depression, great challenges and great threats. Andat each and every moment, we have risen to meet up these challenges, not as Democrats, notas Republicans, but as Americans, with resolve and with confidence, with that fundamentalbelief that, here in America, our destiny is not written for us, it's written by us. And that's whowe are. And that's the country I know we can be right now.I want to thank again the extraordinary leadership of Chairman Dodd and Banking --  theBanking Committee, as well as Chairman Baucus and Majority Leader Reid. They have workedtirelessly. I want to thank the leadership in the House of Representatives.I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation, understanding thatthis will not solve all our problems. It is a necessary but not sufficient step to make sure thatthis economy once again works on behalf of all Americans in their pursuit of the Americandream.Thank you, Mr. President.

"Good morning, everybody. I hope you all had a wonderful Thanksgiving.Last week, we announced our economic team, which is working as we speak to craft anEconomic Recovery Program to create jobs and grow our struggling economy. Today, VicePresident-elect Biden and I are pleased to announce our national security team.The national security challenges we face are just as grave -- and just as urgent -- as oureconomic crisis. We are fighting two wars. Our old conflicts remain unresolved, and newlyassertive powers have put strains on the international system. The spread of nuclear weaponsraises the peril that the worlds deadliest technologies could fall into dangerous hands. Ourdependence on foreign oil empowers authoritarian governments and endangers our planet.America must also be strong at home to be strong abroad. We need to provide education andopportunity to all our citizens, so every American can compete with anyone, anywhere. Andour economic power must sustain our military strength, our diplomatic leverage, and ourglobal leadership.The common thread linking these challenges is the fundamental reality that in the 21stcentury, our destiny is shared with the world's. From our markets to our security, from ourpublic health to our climate, we must act with the understanding that, now more than ever,we have a stake in what happens across the globe. And as we learned so painfully on 9/11,terror cannot be contained by borders, nor safety provided by oceans alone.Last week, we were reminded of this threat once again when terrorists took the lives of sixAmerican among nearly 200 victims in Mumbai. In the world we seek, there is no place forthose who kill innocent civilians to advance hateful extremism. This weekend, I told PrimeMinister Singh of India that Americans stand with the people of India in this dark time. And Iam confident that India's great democracy is more resilient than killers who would tear itdown.And so, in this uncertain world, the time has come for a new beginning -- a new dawn ofAmerican leadership to overcome the challenges of the 21st century, and to seize theopportunities embedded in those challenges. We will strengthen our capacity to defeat ourenemies and support our friends. We will renew old alliances and forge new and enduringpartnerships. We will show the world once more that America is relentless in the defense ofour people, steady in advancing our interests, and committed to the ideals that shine as abeacon to the world: democracy and justice; opportunity and unyielding hope -- becauseAmerican values are Americas greatest export to the world.To succeed, we must pursue a new strategy that skillfully uses, balances, and integrates allelements of American power: our military and diplomacy; our intelligence and lawenforcement; our economy and the power of our moral example. The team that we'veassembled here today is uniquely suited to do just that.In their past service and plans for the future, these men and women represent all of thoseelements of American power, and the very best of the American example. They've served inuniform and as diplomats; they have worked as legislators, law enforcement officials, andexecutives. They share my pragmatism about the use of power, and my sense of purposeabout America's role as a leader in the world.I have known Hillary Clinton as a friend, a colleague, a source of counsel, and as a campaignopponent. She possesses an extraordinary intelligence and a remarkable work ethic. I amproud that she will be our next Secretary of State. She is an American of tremendous staturewho will have my complete confidence, who knows many of the world's leaders, who willcommand respect in every capitol, and who will clearly have the ability to advance ourinterests around the world.Hillarys appointment is a sign to friend and foe of the seriousness of my commitment torenew American diplomacy and restore our alliances. There is much to do -- from preventingthe spread of nuclear weapons to Iran and North Korea, to seeking a lasting peace betweenIsrael and the Palestinians, to strengthening international institutions. I have no doubt thatHillary Clinton is the right person to lead our State Department, and to work with me intackling this ambitious foreign policy agenda.At a time when we face unprecedented transition amidst two wars, I've have asked RobertGates to continue as Secretary of Defense, and I'm pleased that he's accepted. Two yearsago, he took over the Pentagon at a difficult time. He restored accountability. He won theconfidence of military commanders and the trust of our brave men and women in uniform, aswell as their families. He earned the respect of members of Congress on both sides of the aislefor his pragmatism and competence. He knows that we need a sustainable national securitystrategy -- and that includes a bipartisan consensus at home.As I said throughout the campaign, I will be giving Secretary Gates and our military a newmission as soon as I take office: responsibly ending the war in Iraq through a successfultransition to Iraqi control. We will also ensure that we have the strategy and resources tosucceed against al Qaeda and the Taliban. As Bob said not too long ago, Afghanistan is wherethe war on terror began, and it is where it must end. And going forward, we will continue tomake the investments necessary to strengthen our military and increase our ground forces todefeat the threats of the 21st century.Eric Holder has the talent and commitment to succeed as Attorney General from his first dayon the job, which is even more important in a transition that demands vigilance. He hasdistinguished himself as a prosecutor, a judge, and a senior official, and he is deeply familiarwith the law enforcement challenges we face -- from terrorism to counter-intelligence, fromwhite collar crime to public corruption. Eric also has the combination of toughness andindependence that we need at the Justice Department. Let me be clear: The Attorney Generalserves the American people. And I have every expectation that Eric will protect our people,uphold the public trust, and adhere to our Constitution.Janet Napolitano offers the experience and executive skills we need in the next Secretary ofHomeland Security. She has spent her career protecting people -- as a US Attorney, anAttorney General, and as the Governor of Arizona. She understands the need for aDepartment of Homeland Security that has the capacity to help prevent terrorist attacks andrespond to catastrophe -- be it manmade or natural. Janet assumes this critical role havinglearned the lessons -- some of them painful -- of the last several years, from 9/11 to Katrina.She insists on competence and accountability. She knows firsthand the need to have a partnerin Washington that works well with state and local governments. She understands as well asanyone the danger of an unsecure border. And she will be a leader who can reform asprawling Department while safeguarding our homeland.Susan Rice will take on the crucial task of serving as Permanent Representative of the UnitedStates to the United Nations. Susan has been a close and trusted advisor. As in previousAdministrations, the UN Ambassador will serve as a member of my cabinet and an integralmember of my team. Her background as a scholar, on the National Security Council, andAssistant Secretary of State will serve our nation well at the United Nations. Susan knows thatthe global challenges we face demand global institutions that work. She shares my belief thatthe UN is an indispensable and imperfect forum. She will carry the message that ourcommitment to multilateral action must be coupled with a commitment to reform. We needthe United Nations to be more effective as a venue for collective action -- against terror andproliferation, climate change and genocide, poverty and disease.Finally, I am convinced that General James Jones is uniquely suited to be a strong and skilledNational Security Advisor. Generations of Joneses have served heroically on the battlefield --from the beaches of Tarawa in World War II, to Foxtrot Ridge in Vietnam. Jim's Silver Star is aproud part of that legacy. He will bring to the job the dual experience of serving in uniformand as a diplomat. He has commanded a platoon in battle, served as Supreme AlliedCommander in a time of war, and worked on behalf of peace in the Middle East. Jim is focusedon the threats of today and the future. He understands the connection between energy andnational security, and has worked on the frontlines of global instability  from Kosovo tonorthern Iraq to Afghanistan. He will advise me and work effectively to integrate our effortsacross the government, so that we are effectively using all elements of American power todefeat unconventional threats and promote our values.I am confident that this team is what we need to make a new beginning for American nationalsecurity. This morning, we met to discuss the situation in Mumbai and some of the challengesthat we face in the months and years ahead. In the coming weeks, I will be in close contactwith these advisors, who will be working with their counterparts in the Bush Administration tomake sure that we are ready to hit the ground running on January 20th. Given the range ofthreats that we face and the vulnerability that can be a part of every presidential transition, Ihope that we can proceed swiftly for those national security officials who demandconfirmation.We move forward with the humility that comes with knowing that there are brave men andwomen protecting us on our front lines: diplomats and intelligence officers in dangerouscorners of the world, troops serving their second, third, or fourth tours; FBI agents in thefield, cops on the beat, prosecutors in our courts, and cargo inspectors at our ports. Theseselfless Americans whose names are unknown to most of us will form the backbone of oureffort. If we serve as well as they are serving, we will protect our country and promote ourvalues.And as we move forward with respect for America's tradition of a bipartisan national securitypolicy and a commitment to national unity, we have to recall that when it comes to keepingour nation and our people safe, we are not Republicans or Democrats: We are Americans. There's no monopoly of power or wisdom in either party. Together, as one nation, as onepeople, we can shape our times instead of being shaped by them. Together, we will meet thechallenges of the 21st century not with fear, but with hope.",obama

"Let me begin by thanking George Mason University for their extraordinary hospitality and tothank all the great friends, the governors, the mayors who are in attendance here today.Throughout America's history, there have been some years that simply rolled into the nextwithout much notice or fanfare. And then there are the years that come along once in ageneration, the kind that mark a clean break from a troubled past and set a new course forour nation. This is one of those years.We start 2009 in the midst of a crisis unlike any we have seen in our lifetime, a crisis that hasonly deepened over the last few weeks. Nearly two million jobs have been now lost. And onFriday, we're likely to learn that we lost more jobs last year than at any time since World WarII. Just in the past year, another 2.8 million Americans who want and need full-time workhave had to settle for part-time jobs. Manufacturing has hit a 28-year low. Many businessescannot borrow or make payroll. Many families cannot pay their bills or their mortgage. Manyworkers are watching their life savings disappear. And many, many Americans are bothanxious and uncertain of what the future will hold.Now, I don't believe it's too late to change course, but it will be if we don't take dramaticaction as soon as possible. If nothing is done, this recession could linger for years. Theunemployment rate could reach double digits. Our economy could fall 1 trillion dollars short ofits full capacity, which translates into more than 12,000 dollars in lost income for a family offour.We could lose a generation of potential and promise as more young Americans are forced toforego dreams of college or the chance to train for the jobs of the future. And our nation couldlose the competitive edge that has served as a foundation for our strength and our standing inthe world. In short, a bad situation could become dramatically worse.This crisis did not happen solely by some accident of history or normal turn of the businesscycle. And we won't get out of it by simply waiting for a better day to come or relying on theworn-out dogmas of the past. We arrived at this point due to an era of profoundirresponsibility that stretched from corporate board rooms to the halls of power inWashington, D.C.For years, too many Wall Street executives made imprudent and dangerous decisions, seekingprofits with too little regard for risk, too little regulatory scrutiny, and too little accountability.Banks made loans without concern for whether borrowers could repay them, and someborrowers took advantage of cheap credit to take on debt they couldn't afford. Politiciansspent taxpayer money without wisdom or discipline and too often focused on scoring politicalpoints instead of problems they were sent here to solve. The result has been a devastatingloss of trust and confidence in our economy, our financial markets, and our government.Now, the very fact that this crisis is largely of our own making means that it's not beyond ourability to solve. Our problems are rooted in past mistakes, not our capacity for futuregreatness. It will take time -- perhaps many years -- but we can rebuild that lost trust andconfidence. We can restore opportunity and prosperity. We should never forget that ourworkers are still more productive than any on Earth. Our universities are still the envy of theworld. We are still home to the most brilliant minds, the most creative entrepreneurs, and themost advanced technology and innovation that history has ever known. And we are still thenation that has overcome great fears and improbable odds. If we act with the urgency andseriousness that this moment requires, I know that we can do it again.That is why I have moved quickly to work with my economic team and leaders of both partieson an American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan that will immediately jump-start job creationand long-term growth. It's a plan that represents not just new policy, but a whole newapproach to meeting our most urgent challenges. For if we hope to end this crisis, we mustend the culture of anything goes that helped create it, and this change must begin inWashington. It's time to trade old habits for a new spirit of responsibility. It's time to finallychange the ways of Washington so that we can set a new and better course for America.There is no doubt that the cost of this plan will be considerable. It will certainly add to thebudget deficit in the short term. But equally certain are the consequences of doing too little ornothing at all, for that will lead to an even greater deficit of jobs, incomes, and confidence inour economy.It is true that we cannot depend on government alone to create jobs or long-term growth. Butat this particular moment, only government can provide the short-term boost necessary to liftus from a recession this deep and severe. Only government can break the cycle that are [sic]crippling our economy, where a lack of spending leads to lost jobs, which leads to even lessspending, where an inability to lend and borrow stops growth and leads to even less credit.That's why we need to act boldly and act now to reverse these cycles. That's why we need toput money in the pockets of the American people, create new jobs, and invest in our future.That's why we need to restart the flow of credit and restore the rules of the road that willensure a crisis like this never happens again.Now this plan begins with -- this plan must begin today, a plan I am confident will save orcreate at least three million jobs over the next few years. It's not just another public worksprogram. It's a plan that recognizes both the paradox and promise of this moment: the factthat there are millions of Americans trying to find work, even as all around the country there'sso much work to be done. And that's why we'll invest in priorities like energy and education,health care and a new infrastructure that are necessary to keep us strong and competitive inthe 21st century. That's why the overwhelming majority of the jobs created will be in theprivate sector, while our plan will save the public sector jobs of teachers, police officers,firefighters, and others who provide vital services.To finally spark the creation of a clean energy economy, we will double the production ofalternative energy in the next three years. We will modernize more than 75 percent of federalbuildings and improve the energy efficiency of 2 million American homes, saving consumersand taxpayers billions on our energy bills.In the process, we will put Americans to work in new jobs that pay well and can't beoutsourced, jobs building solar panels and wind turbines, constructing fuel-efficient cars andbuildings, and developing the new energy technologies that will lead to even more jobs, moresavings, and a cleaner, safer planet in the bargain.To improve the quality of our health care while lowering its cost, we will make the immediateinvestments necessary to ensure that, within five years, all of America's medical records arecomputerized. This will cut waste, eliminate red tape and reduce the need to repeat expensivemedical tests. But it just won't save billions of dollars and thousands of jobs; it will save livesby reducing the deadly but preventable medical errors that pervade our health care system.To give our children the chance to live out their dreams in a world that's never been morecompetitive, we will equip tens of thousands of schools, community colleges, and publicuniversities with 21st century classrooms, labs, and libraries. We'll provide new computers,new technology, and new training for teachers so that students in Chicago and Boston cancompete with children in Beijing for the high-tech, high-wage jobs of the future.To build an economy that can lead this future, we will begin to rebuild America. Yes, we'll putpeople to work repairing crumbling roads, bridges, and schools by eliminating the backlog ofwell-planned, worthy, and needed infrastructure projects. But we'll also do more to retrofitAmerica for a global economy. That means updating the way we get our electricity by startingto build a new smart grid that will save us money, protect our power sources from blackout orattack, and deliver clean, alternative forms of energy to every corner of our nation. It meansexpanding broadband lines across America, so that a small business in a rural town canconnect and compete with their counterparts anywhere in the world. It means investing in thescience, research, and technology that will lead to new medical breakthroughs, newdiscoveries, and entire new industries.And finally, this recovery and reinvestment plan will provide immediate relief to states,workers, and families who are bearing the brunt of this recession. To get people spendingagain, 95% of working families will receive a thousand dollar tax cut -- the first stage of amiddle-class tax cut that I promised during the campaign and will include in our next budget.To help Americans who have lost their jobs and can't find new ones, we'll continue thebipartisan extension of unemployment insurance and health care coverage to help themthrough this crisis. Government at every level will have to tighten its belt, but we'll helpstruggling states avoid harmful budget cuts, as long as they take responsibility and use themoney to maintain essential services like police, fire, education, and health care.Now I understand that some might be skeptical of this plan. Our government has alreadyspent a good deal of money, but we haven't yet seen that translate into more jobs or higherincomes or renewed confidence in our economy. And that's why the American Recovery andReinvestment Plan won't just throw money at our problems; we'll invest in what works. Thetrue test of policies we'll pursue won't be whether they're Democratic or Republican ideas,whether they're conservative or liberal ideas, but whether they create jobs, grow oureconomy, and put the American Dream within the reach of the American people.Instead of politicians doling out money behind a veil of secrecy, decisions about where weinvest will be made transparently, and informed by independent experts wherever possible.Every American will be able to hold Washington accountable for these decisions by goingonline to see how and where their taxpayer dollars are being spent. And as I announcedyesterday, we will launch an unprecedented effort to eliminate unwise and unnecessaryspending that has never been more unaffordable for our nation and our children's future thanit is right now.We have to make tough choices and smart investments today so that as the economyrecovers, the deficits start coming down. We cannot have a solid recovery if our people andour businesses don't have confidence that we're getting our fiscal house in order. And that'swhy our goal is not to create a slew of new government programs, but a foundation for long-term economic growth. That also means an economic recovery plan that is free from earmarksand pet projects. I understand that every member of Congress has ideas about how to spendmoney. Many of these projects are worthy. They benefit local communities.But this emergency legislation must not be the vehicle for those aspirations. This must be atime when leaders in both parties put the urgent needs of our nation above our own narrowinterests.Now, this recovery plan alone will not solve all the problems that led us into this crisis. Wemust also work with the same sense of urgency to stabilize and repair the financial system weall depend on. That means using our full arsenal of tools to get credit flowing again to familiesand businesses, while restoring confidence in our markets. It means launching a sweepingeffort to address the foreclosure crisis so that we can keep responsible families in their homes.It means preventing the catastrophic failure of financial institutions whose collapse couldendanger the entire economy, but only with maximum protections for taxpayers and a clearunderstanding that government support for any company is an extraordinary action that mustcome with significant restrictions on the firms that receive support. And it means reforming aweak and outdated regulatory system so that we can better withstand financial shocks andbetter protect consumers, investors, and businesses from the reckless greed and risk-takingthat must never endanger our prosperity again.No longer can we allow Wall Street wrongdoers to slip through regulatory cracks. No longercan we allow special interests to put their thumbs on the economic scales. No longer can weallow the unscrupulous lending and borrowing that leads only to destructive cycles of bubbleand bust. It is time to set a new course for this economy, and that change must begin now.We should have an open and honest discussion about this recovery plan in the days ahead,but I urge Congress to move as quickly as possible on behalf of the American people. Forevery day we wait or point fingers or drag our feet, more Americans will lose their jobs. Morefamilies will lose their savings. More dreams will be deferred and denied. And our nation willsink deeper into a crisis that, at some point, we may not be able to reverse.That is not the country I know. It is not a future I accept as President of the United States. Aworld that depends on the strength of our economy is now watching and waiting for Americato lead once more. And that is what we will do.It will not come easy or happen overnight, and it is altogether likely that things may get worsebefore they get better. But that is all the more reason for Congress to act without delay. Iknow the scale of this plan is unprecedented, but so is the severity of our situation. We havealready tried the wait-and-see approach to our problems, and it is the same approach thathelped lead us to this day of reckoning.And that is why the time has come to build a 21st century economy in which hard work andresponsibility are once again rewarded. That's why I'm asking Congress to work with me andmy team day and night, on weekends if necessary, to get the plan passed in the next fewweeks.That's why I'm calling on all Americans -- Democrats and Republicans and Independents -- toput -- to put good ideas ahead of the old ideological battles; a sense of common purposeabove the same narrow partisanship; and insist that the first question each of us asks isn't,""What's good for me?"" but ""What's good for the country my children will inherit?""More than any program or policy, it is this spirit that will enable us to confront thesechallenges with the same spirit that has led previous generations to face down war, anddepression, and fear itself. And if we do, if we are able to summon that spirit again, if we areable to look out for one another, and listen to one another, and do our part for our nation andfor posterity, then I have no doubt that years from now, we will look back on 2009 as one ofthose years that marked another new and hopeful beginning for the United States of America.Thank you, God Bless You, and may God Bless America.",obama

"I, Barack Hussein Obama, do solemnly swear that I will execute the office of the President of theUnited States faithfully1, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend theConstitution of the United States, so help me God.Thank you, thank you.My fellow citizens:I stand here today humbled by the task before us, grateful for the trust you've bestowed,mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors. I thank President Bush for his service to ournation, as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition. Forty-four Americans have now taken the presidential Oath. The words have been spokenduring rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace. Yet, every so often the Oath istaken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms.At these moments, America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those inhigh office, but because We the People have remained faithful to the ideals of our forebearers[sic], and true to our founding documents.So it has been. So it must be with this generation of Americans.That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood. Our nation is at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred. Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence ofgreed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hardchoices and prepare the nation for a new age. Homes have been lost; jobs shed; businessesshuttered. Our health care is too costly; our schools fail too many; and each day bringsfurther evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten ourplanet.These are the indicators of crisis, subject to data and statistics. Less measurable, but no lessprofound, is a sapping of confidence across our land -- a nagging fear that America's decline isinevitable, that the next generation must lower its sights. Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real. They are serious and they are many.They will not be met easily or in a short span of time. But know this, America: They will bemet.On this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflictand discord.On this day, we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises, therecriminations and worn out dogmas, that for far too long have strangled our politics. We remain a young nation, but in the words of Scripture, the time has come to ""set asidechildish things.""2 The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit; to choose our betterhistory; to carry forward that precious gift, that noble idea, passed on from generation togeneration: the God-given promise that all are equal, all are free, and all deserve a chance topursue their full measure of happiness.In reaffirming the greatness of our nation, we understand that greatness is never a given. Itmust be earned. Our journey has never been one of short-cuts or settling for less. It has notbeen the path for the faint-hearted -- for those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only thepleasures of riches and fame. Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers ofthings -- some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor, who havecarried us up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and freedom.For us, they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of anew life.For us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West; endured the lash of the whip andplowed the hard earth.For us, they fought and died, in places like Concord and Gettysburg; Normandy and Khe Sahn.Time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their handswere raw so that we might live a better life. They saw America as bigger than the sum of ourindividual ambitions; greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction.This is the journey we continue today. We remain the most prosperous, powerful nation onEarth. Our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began. Our minds are no lessinventive, our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month orlast year. Our capacity remains undiminished. But our time of standing pat, of protectingnarrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions - that time has surely passed. Startingtoday, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remakingAmerica.For everywhere we look, there is work to be done. The state of our economy calls for action,bold and swift, and we will act -- not only to create new jobs, but to lay a new foundation forgrowth. We will build the roads and bridges, the electric grids and digital lines that feed ourcommerce and bind us together. We will restore science to its rightful place, and wieldtechnology's wonders to raise health care's quality and lower its cost. We will harness the sunand the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories. And we will transform ourschools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age.All this we can do.All this we will do.Now, there are some who question the scale of our ambitions -- who suggest that our systemcannot tolerate too many big plans. Their memories are short. For they have forgotten whatthis country has already done; what free men and women can achieve when imagination isjoined to common purpose, and necessity to courage.What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them -- that thestale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply. The question weask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works --whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that isdignified. Where the answer is yes, we intend to move forward. Where the answer is no,programs will end. And those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to account --to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do our business in the light of day -- because onlythen can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government.Nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill. Its power togenerate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched, but this crisis has reminded us thatwithout a watchful eye, the market can spin out of control. The nation cannot prosper longwhen it favors only the prosperous. The success of our economy has always depended not juston the size of our Gross Domestic Product, but on the reach of our prosperity; on the ability toextend opportunity to every willing heart -- not out of charity, but because it is the surestroute to our common good.As for our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals.Our Founding Fathers, faced with perils that we can scarcely imagine, drafted a charter toassure the rule of law and the rights of man, a charter expanded by the blood of generations.Those ideals still light the world, and we will not give them up for expedience'[s] sake. And soto all the other peoples and governments who are watching today, from the grandest capitalsto the small village where my father was born: Know that America is a friend of each nationand every man, woman, and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity. And we are readyto lead once more. Recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles andtanks, but with the sturdy alliances and enduring convictions. They understood that our poweralone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please. Instead, they knew that ourpower grows through its prudent use; our security emanates from the justness of our cause,the force of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and restraint.We are the keepers of this legacy. Guided by these principles once more, we can meet thosenew threats that demand even greater effort -- even greater cooperation and understandingbetween nations. We will begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its people, and forge a hard-earned peace in Afghanistan. With old friends and former foes, we will work tirelessly tolessen the nuclear threat, and roll back the specter of a warming planet. We will not apologizefor our way of life, nor will we waver in its defense, and for those who seek to advance theiraims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit isstronger and cannot be broken. You cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you!For we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness. We are a nation ofChristians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus -- and non-believers. We are shaped by everylanguage and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth; and because we have tasted thebitter swill of civil war and segregation, and emerged from that dark chapter stronger andmore united, we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that thelines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as the world grows smaller, our common humanity shallreveal itself; and that America must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace.To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutualrespect. To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society'sills on the West -- know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what youdestroy.To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, knowthat you are on the wrong side of history; but that we will extend a hand if you are willing tounclench your fist.To the people of poor nations, we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourishand let clean waters flow; to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds. And to thosenations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can no longer afford indifference to thesuffering outside our borders; nor can we consume the world's resources without regard toeffect. For the world has changed, and we must change with it.As we consider the road that unfolds before us, we remember with humble gratitude thosebrave Americans who, at this very hour, patrol far-off deserts and distant mountains. Theyhave something to tell us, just as the fallen heroes who lie in Arlington whisper through theages. We honor them not only because they are the guardians of our liberty, but because theyembody the spirit of service; a willingness to find meaning in something greater thanthemselves. And yet, at this moment -- a moment that will define a generation -- it isprecisely this spirit that must inhabit us all.For as much as government can do and must do, it is ultimately the faith and determination ofthe American people upon which this nation relies. It is the kindness to take in a strangerwhen the levees break, the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than seea friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours. It is the firefighter's courageto storm a stairway filled with smoke, but also a parent's willingness to nurture a child, thatfinally decides our fate. Our challenges may be new. The instruments with which we meet them may be new. Butthose values upon which our success depends -- honesty and hard work, courage and fairplay, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism -- these things are old. These things aretrue. They have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history. What is demandedthen is a return to these truths. What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility -- arecognition, on the part of every American, that we have duties to ourselves, our nation, andthe world, duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in theknowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit, so defining of our character, thangiving our all to a difficult task.This is the price and the promise of citizenship.This is the source of our confidence -- the knowledge that God calls on us to shape anuncertain destiny.This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed -- why men and women and children of everyrace and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall, and why a manwhose father less than sixty years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant cannow stand before you to take a most sacred Oath.So let us mark this day with remembrance, of who we are and how far we have traveled. Inthe year of America's birth, in the coldest of months, a small band of patriots huddled bydying campfires on the shores of an icy river. The Capitol was abandoned. The enemy wasadvancing. The snow was stained with blood. At a moment when the outcome of ourrevolution was most in doubt, the father of our nation ordered these words be read to thepeople:Let it be told to the future world...that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hopeand virtue could survive...that the city and the country, alarmed at one commondanger, came forth to meet [it].America: In the face of our common dangers, in this winter of our hardship, let us rememberthese timeless words. With hope and virtue, let us brave once more the icy currents, andendure what storms may come. Let it be said by our children's children that when we weretested we refused to let this journey end, that we did not turn back nor did we falter; and witheyes fixed on the horizon and God's grace upon us, we carried forth that great gift of freedomand delivered it safely to future generations.Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.",obama
"Let me first of all say how grateful I am for all of you being here, and how much weappreciate everything that you've done. I know that there are a lot of people here who havebeen so engaged in the campaign, have sacrificed so much, people who've been involved backsince 2007. And...so I...want all of you to know how appreciative I am. And I know many of you came here today for a campaign event. I was looking forward tohaving a fun conversation with you about some really important matters that we face as acountry and the differences between myself and my opponent in this election.But this morning, we woke up to news of a tragedy that reminds us of all the ways that weare united as one American family.By now, many of you know, many of you have heard that a few miles outside of Denver, in atown call Aurora, at least 12 people were killed when a gunman opened fire in a movietheater, and dozens more are being treated for injuries at a local hospital. Some of the victimsare being treated at a childrens hospital. Now, were still gathering all the facts about what happened in Aurora, but what we do knowis that the police have one suspect in custody. And the federal government stands ready to dowhatever is necessary to bring whoever is responsible for this heinous crime to justice -- andwe will take every step possible to ensure the safety of all of our people. We're going to stand by our neighbors in Colorado during this extraordinarily difficult time.And I had a chance to speak with the Mayor of Aurora as well as the Governor of Colorado toexpress, not just on behalf of Michelle and myself, but the entire American family, howheartbroken we are.Now, even as we learn how this happened and who's responsible, we may never understandwhat leads anybody to terrorize their fellow human beings like this. Such violence, such evil issenseless. It's beyond reason.But while we will never know fully what causes somebody to take the life of another, we doknow what makes life worth living. The people we lost in Aurora loved and they were loved.They were mothers and fathers; they were husbands and wives; sisters and brothers; sonsand daughters, friends and neighbors. They had hopes for the future and they had dreamsthat were not yet fulfilled. And if theres anything to take away from this tragedy its the reminder that life is very fragile.Our time here is limited and it is precious. And what matters at the end of the day is not thesmall things; its not the trivial things, which so often consume us and our daily lives.Ultimately, its how we choose to treat one another and how we love one another.It's what we do on a daily basis to give our lives meaning and to give our lives purpose. Thatswhat matters. At the end of the day, what well remember will be those we loved and what wedid for others. Thats why were here.Im sure that many of you who are parents here had the same reaction that I did when Iheard this news. My daughters go to the movies. What if Malia and Sasha had been at thetheater, as so many of our kids do every day? Michelle and I will be fortunate enough to hugour girls a little tighter tonight, and Im sure you will do the same with your children. But forthose parents who may not be so lucky, we have to embrace them and let them know we willbe there for them as a nation.So, again, I am so grateful that all of you are here. I am...so moved by your support. Butthere are going to be other days for politics. This, I think, is a day for prayer and reflection.So what Id ask everybody to do, Id like us to pause in a moment of silence for the victims ofthis terrible tragedy, for the people who knew them and loved them, for those who are stillstruggling to recover, and for all the victims of less publicized acts of violence that plague ourcommunities every single day.So if everybody can just take a moment.Thank you, everybody.I hope all of you will keep the people of Aurora in your hearts and minds today. May the Lordbring them comfort and healing in hard days to come.I am grateful to all of you, and I hope that as a consequence of todays events, as you leavehere, you spend a little time thinking about the incredible blessings that God has given us.Thank you very much, everybody.God bless you.God bless the United States of America.",obama
"In short, if we do not act boldly and swiftly, a bad situation could become dramatically worse.That is why I have proposed an American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan to immediatelyjumpstart job creation as well as long-term economic growth. I am pleased to say that bothparties in Congress are already hard at work on this plan, and I hope to sign it into law in lessthan a month.Its a plan that will save or create three to four million jobs over the next few years, and onethat recognizes both the paradox and the promise of this moment -- the fact that there aremillions of Americans trying to find work even as, all around the country, theres so muchwork to be done. Thats why this is not just a short-term program to boost employment. Itsone that will invest in our most important priorities like energy and education; health care anda new infrastructure that are necessary to keep us strong and competitive in the 21st century.Today Id like to talk specifically about the progress we expect to make in each of these areas.To accelerate the creation of a clean energy economy, we will double our capacity to generatealternative sources of energy like wind, solar, and biofuels over the next three years. Wellbegin to build a new electricity grid that lay down more than 3,000 miles of transmission linesto convey this new energy from coast to coast. Well save taxpayers $2 billion a year bymaking 75% of federal buildings more energy efficient, and save the average working family$350 on their energy bills by weatherizing 2.5 million homes.To lower health care cost, cut medical errors, and improve care, well computerize the nationshealth record in five years, saving billions of dollars in health care costs and countless lives.And well protect health insurance for more than 8 million Americans who are in danger oflosing their coverage during this economic downturn.To ensure our children can compete and succeed in this new economy, well renovate andmodernize 10,000 schools, building state-of-the-art classrooms, libraries, and labs to improvelearning for over five million students. Well invest more in Pell Grants to make collegeaffordable for seven million more students, provide a $2,500 college tax credit to four millionstudents, and triple the number of fellowships in science to help spur the next generation ofinnovation.Finally, we will rebuild and retrofit America to meet the demands of the 21st century. Thatmeans repairing and modernizing thousands of miles of Americas roadways and providingnew mass transit options for millions of Americans. It means protecting America by securing90 major ports and creating a better communications network for local law enforcement andpublic safety officials in the event of an emergency. And it means expanding broadbandaccess to millions of Americans, so business can compete on a level-playing field, wherevertheyre located.I know that some are skeptical about the size and scale of this recovery plan. I understandthat skepticism, which is why this recovery plan must and will include unprecedentedmeasures that will allow the American people to hold my Administration accountable for theseresults. We wont just throw money at our problems -- well invest in what works. Instead ofpoliticians doling out money behind a veil of secrecy, decisions about where we invest will bemade public, and informed by independent experts whenever possible. Well launch anunprecedented effort to root out waste, inefficiency, and unnecessary spending in ourgovernment, and every American will be able to see how and where we spend taxpayerdollars by going to a new website called recovery.gov.No one policy or program will solve the challenges we face right now, nor will this crisis recedein a short period of time. But if we act now and act boldly; if we start rewarding hard workand responsibility once more; if we act as citizens and not partisans and begin again the workof remaking America, then I have faith that we will emerge from this trying time evenstronger and more prosperous than we were before.Thanks for listening.",obama

"Good morning President Taylor, Board of Trustees, faculty, parents, family, friends, thecommunity of Galesburg, the class of 1955 -- which I understand was out partying last night,and yet still showed up here on time -- and most of all, the Class of 2005. Congratulations onyour graduation, and thank you -- thank you for the honor of allowing me to be a part of it.Thank you also, Mr. President, for this honorary degree. It was only a couple of years ago thatI stopped paying my student loans in law school. Had I known it was this easy, I would haveran [sic] for the United States Senate earlier.You know, it has been about six months now since you sent me to Washington as your UnitedStates Senator. I recognize that not all of you voted for me, so for those of you mutteringunder your breath ""I didnt send you anywhere,"" that's ok too. Maybe well hold -- What doyou call it? -- a little Pumphandle after the ceremony. Change your mind for the next time.It has been a fascinating journey thus far. Each time I walk onto the Senate floor, I'mreminded of the history, for good and for ill, that has been made there. But there have been afew surreal moments.For example, I remember the day before I was sworn in, myself and my staff, we decided tohold a press conference in our office. Now, keep in mind that I am ranked 99th in seniority. Iwas proud that I wasnt ranked dead last until I found out that its just because Illinois isbigger than Colorado. So Im 99th in seniority, and all the reporters are crammed into the tinytransition office that I have, which is right next to the janitors closet in the basement of theDirksen Office Building. Its my first day in the building, I have not taken a single vote, I havenot introduced one bill, had not even sat down in my desk, and this very earnest reporterraises his hand and says:Senator Obama, what is your place in history?I did what you just did, which is laugh out loud. I said, ""place in history?"" I thought he waskidding. At that point, I wasnt even sure the other Senators would save a place for me at thecool kids table.But as I was thinking about the words to share with this class, about whats next, aboutwhats possible, and what opportunities lay ahead, I actually think its not a bad question foryou, the class of 2005, to ask yourselves: What will be your place in history?In other eras, across distant lands, this question could be answered with relative ease andcertainty. As a servant in Rome, you knew youd spend your life forced to build somebodyelses Empire. As a peasant in 11th Century China, you knew that no matter how hard youworked, the local warlord might come and take everything you had -- and you also knew thatfamine might come knocking at the door. As a subject of King George, you knew that yourfreedom of worship and your freedom to speak and to build your own life would be ultimatelylimited by the throne.And then America happened.A place where destiny was not a destination, but a journey to be shared and shaped andremade by people who had the gall, the temerity to believe that, against all odds, they couldform a more perfect union on this new frontier.And as people around the world began to hear the tale of the lowly colonists who overthrewan empire for the sake of an idea, they started to come. Across oceans and the ages, theysettled in Boston and Charleston, Chicago and St. Louis, Kalamazoo and Galesburg, to try andbuild their own American Dream. This collective dream moved forward imperfectly -- it wasscarred by our treatment of native peoples, betrayed by slavery, clouded by the subjugationof women, shaken by war and depression. And yet, brick by brick, rail by rail, calloused handby calloused hand, people kept dreaming, and building, and working, and marching, andpetitioning their government, until they made America a land where the question of our placein history is not answered for us. Its answered by us.Have we failed at times? Absolutely. Will you occasionally fail when you embark on your ownAmerican journey? You surely will. But the test is not perfection.The true test of the American ideal is whether were able to recognize our failings and thenrise together to meet the challenges of our time. Whether we allow ourselves to be shaped byevents and history, or whether we act to shape them. Whether chance of birth orcircumstance decides lifes big winners and losers, or whether we build a community where, atthe very least, everyone has a chance to work hard, get ahead, and reach their dreams.We have faced this choice before.At the end of the Civil War, when farmers and their families began moving into the cities towork in the big factories that were sprouting up all across America, we had to decide:  Do wedo nothing and allow captains of industry and robber barons to run roughshod over theeconomy and workers by competing to see who can pay the lowest wages at the worstworking conditions? Or do we try to make the system work by setting up basic rules for themarket, instituting the first public schools, busting up monopolies, letting workers organizeinto unions?We chose to act, and we rose together.When the irrational exuberance of the Roaring Twenties came crashing down with the stockmarket, we had to decide: do we follow the call of leaders who would do nothing, or the call ofa leader who, perhaps because of his physical paralysis, refused to accept political paralysis?We chose to act -- regulating the market, putting people back to work, expanding bargainingrights to include health care and a secure retirement -- and together we rose.When World War II required the most massive home front mobilization in history and weneeded every single American to lend a hand, we had to decide: Do we listen to skeptics whotold us it wasnt possible to produce that many tanks and planes? Or, did we build RooseveltsArsenal for Democracy and grow our economy even further by providing our returning heroeswith a chance to go to college and own their own home?Again, we chose to act, and again, we rose together.Today, at the beginning of this young century, we have to decide again. But this time, it isyour turn to choose.Here in Galesburg, you know what this new challenge is. Youve seen it. All of you, your firstyear in college saw what happened at 9/11. Its already been noted, the degree to which yourlives will be intertwined with the war on terrorism that currently is taking place. But whatyouve also seen, perhaps not as spectacularly, is the fact that when you drive by the oldMaytag plant around lunchtime, no one walks out anymore.I saw it during the campaign when I met union guys who worked at the plant for 20, 30 yearsand now wonder what theyre gonna do at the age of 55 without a pension or health care;when I met the man whos son needed a new liver but because hed been laid off, didnt knowif he could afford to provide his child the care that he needed.Its as if someone changed the rules in the middle of the game and no wonder -- no onebothered to tell these folks. And, in reality, the rules have changed.It started with technology and automation that rendered entire occupations obsolete. Whenwas the last time anybody here stood in line for the bank teller instead of going to the ATM, ortalked to a switchboard operator? Then it continued when companies like Maytag were able topick up and move their factories to some under developed country where workers were a lotcheaper than they are in the United States.As Tom Friedman points out in his new book, The World Is Flat, over the last decade or so,these forces -- technology and globalization -- have combined like never before. So that whilemost of us have been paying attention to how much easier technology has made our own lives-- sending e-mails back and forth on our blackberries, surfing the Web on our cell phones,instant messaging with friends across the world -- a quiet revolution has been breaking downbarriers and connecting the worlds economies. Now business not only has the ability to movejobs wherever theres a factory, but wherever theres an internet connection.Countries like India and China realized this. They understand that they no longer need to bejust a source of cheap labor or cheap exports. They can compete with us on a global scale.The one resource they needed were skilled, educated workers. So they started schooling theirkids earlier, longer, with a greater emphasis on math and science and technology, until theirmost talented students realized they dont have to come to America to have a decent life --they can stay right where they are.The result? China is graduating four times the number of engineers that the United States isgraduating. Not only are those Maytag employees competing with Chinese and Indian andIndonesian and Mexican workers, you are too. Today, accounting firms are e-mailing your taxreturns to workers in India who will figure them out and send them back to you as fast as anyworker in Illinois or Indiana could.When you lose your luggage in Boston at an airport, tracking it down may involve a call to anagent in Bangalore, who will find it by making a phone call to Baltimore. Even the AssociatedPress has outsourced some of their jobs to writers all over the world who can send in a storyat a click of a mouse.As Prime Minister Tony Blair has said, in this new economy, ""Talent is the 21st centurywealth.""  If you've got the skills, you've got the education, and you have the opportunity toupgrade and improve both, youll be able to compete and win anywhere. If not, the fall will befurther and harder than it ever was before.So what do we do about this? How does America find its way in this new, globaleconomy? What will our place in history be?Like so much of the American story, once again, we face a choice. Once again, there are thosewho believe that there isnt much we can do about this as a nation. That the best idea is togive everyone one big refund on their government -- divvy it up by individual portions, in theform of tax breaks, hand it out, and encourage everyone to use their share to go buy theirown health care, their own retirement plan, their own child care, their own education, and soon.In Washington, they call this the Ownership Society. But in our past there has been anotherterm for it -- Social Darwinism -- every man or woman for him or herself. Its a tempting idea,because it doesnt require much thought or ingenuity. It allows us to say that those whosehealth care or tuition may rise faster than they can afford -- tough luck. It allows us to say tothe Maytag workers who have lost their job -- life isnt fair. It lets us say to the child who wasborn into poverty -- pull yourself up by your bootstraps. And it is especially tempting becauseeach of us believes we will always be the winner in lifes lottery, that were the one who will bethe next Donald Trump, or at least we wont be the chump who Donald Trump says: Yourefired!But there is a problem. It wont work. It ignores our history. It ignores the fact that its beengovernment research and investment that made the railways possible and the internetpossible. Its been the creation of a massive middle class, through decent wages and benefitsand public schools that allowed us all to prosper. Our economic dependence depended onindividual initiative. It depended on a belief in the free market; but it has also depended onour sense of mutual regard for each other, the idea that everybody has a stake in the country,that were all in it together and everybodys got a shot at opportunity. Thats whats producedour unrivaled political stability.And so if we do nothing in the face of globalization, more people will continue to lose theirhealth care. Fewer kids will be able to afford the diploma youre about to receive.More companies like United Airlines wont be able to provide pensions for their employees.And those Maytag workers will be joined in the unemployment line by any worker whose skillscan be bought and sold on the global market.So today Im here to tell you what most of you already know. This is not us -- the option thatI just mentioned. Doing nothing. Its not how our story ends -- not in this country. America isa land of big dreamers and big hopes.It is this hope that has sustained us through revolution and civil war, depression and worldwar, a struggle for civil and social rights and the brink of nuclear crisis. And it is because ourdreamers dreamed that we have emerged from each challenge more united, more prosperous,and more admired than before.So lets dream. Instead of doing nothing or simply defending 20th century solutions, letsimagine together what we could do to give every American a fighting chance in the 21stcentury.What if we prepared every child in America with the education and skills they need to competein the new economy?  If we made sure that college was affordable for everyone who wantedto go? If we walked up to those Maytag workers and we said Your old job is not coming back,but a new job will be there because were going to seriously retrain you and theres life-longeducation thats waiting for you -- the sorts of opportunities that Knox has created with theStrong Futures scholarship program.What if no matter where you worked or how many times you switched jobs, you had healthcare and a pension that stayed with you always, so you all had the flexibility to move to abetter job or start a new business? What if instead of cutting budgets for research anddevelopment and science, we fueled the genius and the innovation that will lead to the newjobs and new industries of the future?Right now, all across America, there are amazing discoveries being made. If we supportedthese discoveries on a national level, if we committed ourselves to investing in thesepossibilities, just imagine what it could do for a town like Galesburg. Ten or twenty yearsdown the road, that old Maytag plant could re-open its doors as an Ethanol refinery thatturned corn into fuel. Down the street, a biotechnology research lab could open up on thecusp of discovering a cure for cancer. And across the way, a new auto company could be busychurning out electric cars. The new jobs created would be filled by American workers trainedwith new skills and a world-class education.All of that is possible but none of it will come easy. Every one of us is going to have to workmore, read more, train more, think more. We will have to slough off some bad habits -- likedriving gas guzzlers that weaken our economy and feed our enemies abroad. Our children willhave to turn off the TV set once in a while and put away the video games and start hitting thebooks. Well have to reform institutions, like our public schools, that were designed for anearlier time. Republicans will have to recognize our collective responsibilities, even asDemocrats recognize that we have to do more than just defend old programs.It wont be easy, but it can be done. It can be our future. We have the talent and theresources and brainpower. But now we need the political will. We need a nationalcommitment.And we need each of you.Now, no one can force you to meet these challenges. If you want, it will be pretty easy for youto leave here today and not give another thought to towns like Galesburg and the challengesthey face. There is no community service requirement in the real world; no one is forcing youto care.You can take your diploma, walk off this stage, and go chasing after the big house, and thenice suits, and all the other things that our money culture says that you should want, that youshould aspire to, that you can buy.But I hope you dont walk away from the challenge. Focusing your life solely on making a buckshows a certain poverty of ambition. It asks too little of yourself. You need to take up thechallenges that we face as a nation and make them your own. Not because you have a debt tothose who helped you get here, although you do have that debt. Not because you have anobligation to those who are less fortunate than you, although I do think you do have thatobligation. Its primarily because you have an obligation to yourself. Because individualsalvation has always depended on collective salvation. Because its only when you hitch yourwagon to something larger than yourself that you realize your true potential.And I know that all of you are wondering how youll do this, the challenges seem so big. Theyseem so difficult for one person to make a difference.But we know it can be done. Because where youre sitting, in this very place, in this town, itshappened before.Nearly two centuries ago, before civil rights, before voting rights, before Abraham Lincoln,before the Civil War, before all of that, America was stained by the sin of slavery. In thesweltering heat of southern plantations, men and women who looked like me could not escapethe life of pain and servitude in which they were sold. And yet, year after year, as this moralcancer ate away at the American ideals of liberty and equality, the nation was silent.But its people didnt stay silent for long.One by one, abolitionists emerged to tell their fellow Americans that this would not be ourplace in history -- that this was not the America that had captured the imagination of theworld.This resistance that they met was fierce, and some paid with their lives. But they would not bedeterred, and they soon spread out across the country to fight for their cause. One man fromNew York went west, all the way to the prairies of Illinois to start a colony.And here in Galesburg, freedom found a home.Here in Galesburg, the main depot for the Underground Railroad in Illinois, escaped slavescould roam freely on the streets and take shelter in peoples homes. And when their mastersor the police would come for them, the people of this town would help them escape north,some literally carrying them in their arms to freedom.Think about the risks that involved. If they were caught abetting a fugitive, you couldve beenjailed or lynched. It would have been simple for these townspeople to turn the other way; togo live their lives in a private peace.And yet, they didnt do that. Why?Because they knew that we were all Americans; that we were all brothers and sisters; thesame reason that a century later, young men and women your age would take Freedom Ridesdown south, to work for the Civil Rights movement. The same reason that black women wouldwalk instead of ride a bus after a long day of doing somebody elses laundry and cleaningsomebody elses kitchen. Because they were marching for freedom.Today, on this day of possibility, we stand in the shadow of a lanky, raw-boned man with littleformal education who once took the stage at Old Main and told the nation that if anyone didnot believe the American principles of freedom and equality, that those principles weretimeless and all-inclusive, they should go rip that page out of the Declaration ofIndependence.My hope for all of you is that as you leave here today, you decide to keep these principlesalive in your own life and in the life of this country. You will be tested. You wont alwayssucceed. But know that you have it within your power to try. That generations who have comebefore you faced these same fears and uncertainties in their own time. And that through ourcollective labor, and through Gods providence, and our willingness to shoulder each othersburdens, America will continue on its precious journey towards that distant horizon, and abetter day.Thank you so much class of 2005, and congratulations on your graduation. Thank you.",obama
"Thank you, Tim, for your hard work on this issue and on our economic recovery. The economic crisis we face is unlike any we've seen in our lifetime. It's a crisis of fallingconfidence and rising debt, of widely distributed risk and narrowly concentrated reward; acrisis written in the fine print of sub-prime mortgages, on the ledger lines of once mightyfinancial institutions, and on the pink slips that have upended the lives of so many peopleacross this country and cost the economy 2.6 million jobs last year alone.We know that even if we do everything that we should, this crisis was years in the making,and it will take more than weeks or months to turn things around.But make no mistake: A failure to act, and act now, will turn crisis into a catastrophe andguarantee a longer recession, a less robust recovery, and a more uncertain future. Millionsmore jobs will be lost. More businesses will be shuttered. More dreams will be deferred.And that's why I feel such a sense of urgency about the economic recovery and reinvestmentplan that is before Congress today. With it, we can save or create more than three millionjobs, doing things that will strengthen our country for years to come. It's not merely aprescription for short-term spending -- it's a strategy for long-term economic growth in areaslike renewable energy and health care and education.Now, in the past few days I've heard criticisms that this plan is somehow wanting, and thesecriticisms echo the very same failed economic theories that led us into this crisis in the firstplace -- the notion that tax cuts alone will solve all our problems; that we can ignorefundamental challenges like energy independence and the high cost of health care; that we can somehow deal with this in a piecemeal fashion and still expect our economy and ourcountry to thrive.I reject those theories. And so did the American people when they went to the polls inNovember and voted resoundingly for change. So I urge members of Congress to act withoutdelay. No plan is perfect, and we should work to make it stronger. No one is more committedto making it stronger than me. But let's not make the perfect the enemy of the essential. Let'sshow people all over the country who are looking for leadership in this difficult time that weare equal to the task.At the same time, we know that this recovery and reinvestment plan is only the first part ofwhat we need to do to restore prosperity and secure our future. We also need a strong andviable financial system to keep credit flowing to businesses and families alike. And myadministration will do whatever it takes to restore our financial system. Our recovery dependson it. And so in the next week, Secretary Geithner will release a new strategy to get creditmoving again -- a strategy that will reflect some of the lessons of past mistakes while layingthe foundation of the future.But in order to restore trust in our financial system, we're going to have to do more than justput forward our plans. In order to restore trust, we've got to make certain that taxpayer fundsare not subsidizing excessive compensation packages on Wall Street.We all need to take responsibility. And this includes executives at major financial firms whoturned to the American people, hat in hand, when they were in trouble, even as they paidthemselves customary lavish bonuses. As I said last week, this is the height of irresponsibility.It's shameful. And that's exactly the kind of disregard of the costs and consequences of theiractions that brought about this crisis: a culture of narrow self-interest and short-term gain atthe expense of everything else.This is America. We don't disparage wealth. We don't begrudge anybody for achievingsuccess. And we certainly believe that success should be rewarded. But what gets peopleupset -- and rightfully so -- are executives being rewarded for failure, especially when thoserewards are subsidized by U.S. taxpayers, many of whom are having a tough timethemselves.For top executives to award themselves these kinds of compensation packages in the midst ofthis economic crisis isn't just bad taste -- it's bad strategy -- and I will not tolerate it asPresident. We're going to be demanding some restraint in exchange for federal aid -- so thatwhen firms seek new federal dollars, we won't find them up to the same old tricks.As part of the reforms we're announcing today, top executives at firms receiving extraordinaryhelp from U.S. taxpayers will have their compensation capped at 500,000 dollars -- a fractionof the salaries that have been reported recently. And if these executives receive any additionalcompensation, it will come in the form of stock that can't be paid up until taxpayers are paidback for their assistance.Companies receiving federal aid are going to have to disclose publicly all the perks andluxuries bestowed upon senior executives, and provide an explanation to the taxpayers and toshareholders as to why these expenses are justified. And we're putting a stop to these kindsof massive severance packages we've all read about with disgust; we're taking the air out ofgolden parachutes.We're asking these firms to take responsibility, to recognize the nature of this crisis and theirrole in it. We believe that what we've laid out should be viewed as fair and embraced as basiccommon sense.And finally, these guidelines we're putting in place are only the beginning of a long-termeffort. We're going to examine the ways in which the means and manner of executivecompensation have contributed to a reckless culture and a quarter-by-quarter mentality thatin turn helped to wrought havoc in our financial system. We're going to be taking a look atbroader reforms so that executives are compensated for sound risk management, andrewarded for growth measured over years, not just days or weeks. We all have to pull together and take our share of responsibility. That's true here inWashington. That's true on Wall Street. The American people are carrying a huge burden as aresult of this economic crisis: bearing the brunt of its effects as well as the cost ofextraordinary measures we're taking to address them. The American people expect anddemand that we pursue policies that reflect the reality of this crisis -- and that will preventthese kinds of crises from occurring again in the future.Thank you very much.",obama
"Good evening, everybody. Please be seated. Before I take your questions tonight, I'd like to speak briefly about the state of our economy and why Ibelieve we need to put this recovery plan in motion as soon as possible. I took a trip to Elkhart, Indiana, today. Elkhart is a place that has lost jobs faster than anywhere else inAmerica. In one year, the unemployment rate went from 4.7 percent to 15.3 percent. Companies that have sustainedthis community for years are shedding jobs at an alarming speed, and the people who've lost them have noidea what to do or who to turn to. They can't pay their bill and they've stopped spending money. Andbecause they've stopped spending money, more businesses have been forced to lay off more workers. Infact, local TV stations have started running public service announcements that tell people where to find foodbanks, even as the food banks don't have enough to meet the demand. As we speak, similar scenes are playing out in cities and towns across America. Last Monday, more than athousand men and women stood in line for 35 firefighter jobs in Miami. Last month, our economy lost598,000 jobs, which is nearly the equivalent of losing every single job in the state of Maine. And if there'sanyone out there who still doesn't believe this constitutes a full-blown crisis, I suggest speaking to one of themillions of Americans whose lives have been turned upside down because they don't know where their nextpaycheck is coming from. And that is why the single most important part of this Economic Recovery and Reinvestment Plan is the factthat it will save or create up to 4 million jobs, because that's what America needs most right now.It is absolutely true that we can't depend on government alone to create jobs or economic growth. That isand must be the role of the private sector. But at this particular moment, with the private sector soweakened by this recession, the federal government is the only entity left with the resources to jolt oureconomy back into life. It is only government that can break the vicious cycle where lost jobs lead to peoplespending less money, which leads to even more layoffs. And breaking that cycle is exactly what the planthat's moving through Congress is designed to do. When passed, this plan will ensure that Americans who've lost their jobs through no fault of their own canreceive greater unemployment benefits and continue their health care coverage. We will also provide a$2,500 tax credit to folks who are struggling to pay the cost of their college tuition, and $1,000 worth of badlyneeded tax relief to working and middle-class families. These steps will put more money in the pockets ofthose Americans who are most likely to spend it, and that will help break the cycle and get our economymoving. But as we've learned very clearly and conclusively over the last eight years, tax cuts alone can't solve all ofour economic problems -- especially tax cuts that are targeted to the wealthiest few Americans. We have tried that strategy, time and time again. And it's only helped lead us to the crisis we face right now. And that's why we have come together, around a plan that combines hundreds of billions in tax cuts for themiddle class with direct investment in areas like health care, energy, education and infrastructure,investments that will save jobs, create new jobs and new businesses and help our economy grow again,now and in the future. More than 90 percent of the jobs created by this plan will be in the private sector. They're not going to bemake-work jobs but jobs doing the work that America desperately needs done, jobs rebuilding our crumblingroads and bridges, repairing our dangerously deficient dams and levees, so that we don't face anotherKatrina.They'll be jobs building the wind turbines and solar panels and fuel-efficient cars that will lower ourdependence on foreign oil and modernizing our costly health care system that will save us billions of dollarsand countless lives. They'll be jobs creating the 21st-century classrooms, libraries and labs for millions of children acrossAmerica. And they'll be the jobs of firefighters and teachers and police officers that would otherwise beeliminated, if we do not provide states with some relief. Now after many weeks of debate and discussion, the plan that ultimately emerges from Congress must bebig enough and bold enough to meet the size of the economic challenges that we face right now. It's a planthat is already supported by businesses representing almost every industry in America, by both theChamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO. It contains input, ideas and compromises from both Democratsand Republicans. It also contains an unprecedented level of transparency and accountability, so that everyAmerican will be able to go online and see where and how we're spending every dime. What it does not contain, however, is a single pet project, not a single earmark, and it has been stripped ofthe projects members of both parties found most objectionable. Now despite all of this, the plan's not perfect. No plan is. I can't tell you for sure that everything in this planwill work exactly as we hope, but I can tell you with complete confidence that a failure to act will only deepenthis crisis, as well as the pain felt by millions of Americans. My administration inherited a deficit of over $1 trillion, but because we also inherited the most profoundeconomic emergency since the Great Depression, doing little or nothing at all will result in ever -- evengreater deficits, even greater job loss, even greater loss of income and even greater loss of confidence. Those are deficits that could turn a crisis into a catastrophe, and I refuse to let that happen. As long as Ihold this office, I will do whatever it takes to put this economy back on track and put this country back towork. I want to thank the members of Congress who've worked so hard to move this plan forward. But I also wantto urge all members of Congress to act without delay in the coming week to resolve their differences andpass this plan. We find ourselves in a rare moment where the citizens of our country and all countries are watching andwaiting for us to lead. It's a responsibility that this generation did not ask for, but one that we must accept forthe future of our children and our grandchildren. The strongest democracies flourish from frequent and lively debate, but they endure when people of everybackground and belief find a way to set aside smaller differences in service of a greater purpose. That's thetest facing the United States of America in this winter of our hardship, and it is our duty as leaders andcitizens to stay -- stay true to that purpose in the weeks and months ahead. After a day of speaking with and listening to the fundamentally decent men and women who call this nationhome, I have full faith and confidence that we can do it. But we're going to have to work together. That's what I intend to promote in the weeks and days ahead. And with that, I'll take some of your questions. And let me go to Jennifer Loven at AP. There you are. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. Earlier today in Indiana you said something striking. You said thatthis nation could end up in a crisis, without action, that we would be unable to reverse. Can you talk aboutwhat you know or what you're hearing that would lead you to say that our recession might be permanentwhen others in our history have not? And do you think that you risk losing some credibility or even talkingdown the economy by using dire language like that? The latest on President Obama, the new administration and other news from Washington and around thenation.MR. OBAMA: No, no, no, no. I think that what I've said is what other economists have said across thepolitical spectrum, which is that if you delay acting on an economy of this severity, then you potentiallycreate a negative spiral that becomes much more difficult for us to get out of. We saw this happen in Japan in the 1990s, where they did not act boldly and swiftly enough, and as aconsequence they suffered what was called the ""lost decade,"" where essentially for the entire '90s, they didnot see any significant economic growth. So what I'm trying to underscore is what the people in Elkhart already understand, that this is not yourordinary, run-of-the-mill recession. We are going through the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. We've lost now 3.6 million jobs. But what's perhaps even more disturbing is that almost half of that job losshas taken place over the last three months, which means that the problems are accelerating instead ofgetting better. Now, what I said in Elkhart today is what I'll repeat this evening, which is I'm absolutely confident that wecan solve this problem, but it's going to require us to take some significant, important steps. Step number one, we have to pass an economic recovery and reinvestment plan. And we've madeprogress. There was a vote this evening that moved the process forward in the Senate. We already have aHouse bill that's passed. I'm hoping over the next several days that the House and the Senate can reconciletheir differences and get that bill on my desk. There have been criticisms from a bunch of different directions about this bill. So let me just address a fewof them. Some of the criticisms really are with the basic idea that government should intervene at all in this momentof crisis. You have some people, very sincere, who philosophically just think the government has nobusiness interfering in the marketplace. And in fact there are several who have suggested that FDR was wrong to intervene back in the New Deal.They're fighting battles that I thought were resolved a pretty long time ago. Most economists, almost unanimously, recognize that even if philosophically you're -- you're wary ofgovernment intervening in the economy, when you have the kind of problem we have right now -- whatstarted on Wall Street goes to Main Street, suddenly businesses can't get credit, they start paring back theirinvestment, they start laying off workers, workers start pulling back in terms of spending -- that when youhave that situation, that government is an important element of introducing some additional demand into theeconomy. We stand to lose about $1 trillion worth of demand this year and another trillion next year, andwhat that means is you've got this gaping hole in the economy. That's why the -- the figure that we initially came up with, of approximately $800 billion, was put forward.That wasn't just some random number that I plucked out of -- out of a hat. That was Republican andDemocratic, conservative and liberal economists that I spoke to, who indicated that given the magnitude ofthe crisis and the fact that it's happening worldwide, it's important for us to have a bill of sufficient size andscope that we can save or create 4 million jobs. That still means that you're going to have some net job loss,but at least we can start slowing the trend and moving it in the right direction.Now, the recovery and reinvestment package is not the only thing we have to do. It's one leg of the stool.We are still going to have to make sure that we are attracting private capital, get the credit markets flowingagain, because that's the lifeblood of the economy. And so tomorrow my Treasury secretary, Tim Geithner,will be announcing some very clear and specific plans for how we are going to start loosening up credit onceagain. The latest on President Obama, the new administration and other news from Washington and around thenation.And that means having some transparency and oversight in the system. It means that we correct some of the mistakes, with TARP, that were made earlier, the lack of consistency,the lack of clarity, in terms of how the program was going to move forward. It means that we condition taxpayer dollars that are being provided, to the banks, on them showing somerestraint when it comes to executive compensation, not using the money to charter corporate jets whenthey're not necessary. It means that we focus on housing and how are we going to help homeowners that are suffering foreclosureor homeowners who are still making their mortgage payments but are seeing their property values decline. So there's going to be a whole range of approaches that we have to take for dealing with the economy. Mybottom line is to make sure that we are saving or creating 4 million jobs, we are making sure that thefinancial system is working again, that homeowners are getting some relief. And I'm happy to get good ideas from across the political spectrum, from Democrats and Republicans. What I won't do is return to the failed theories of the last eight years that got us into this fix in the first place,because those theories have been tested and they have failed. And that's part of what the election inNovember was all about. Okay? Caren Bohan of Reuters. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. I'd like to shift gears to foreign policy. What is your strategy forengaging Iran, and when will you start to implement it? Will your time table be affected at all by the Iranianelections? And are you getting any indications that Iran is interested in a dialogue with the United States?MR. OBAMA: I said during the campaign that Iran is a country that has extraordinary people, extraordinaryhistory and traditions, but that its actions over many years now have been unhelpful when it comes topromoting peace and prosperity both in the region and around the world; that their attacks or -- or their --their financing of terrorist organizations like Hezbollah and Hamas, the bellicose language that they've usedtowards Israel, their development of a nuclear weapon or their pursuit of a nuclear weapon -- that all ofthose things create the possibility of destabilizing the region and are not only contrary to our interests, but Ithink are contrary to the interests of international peace. What I've also said is that we should take an approach with Iran that employs all of the resources at theUnited States' disposal, and that includes diplomacy. And so my national security team is currentlyreviewing our existing Iran policy, looking at areas where we can have constructive dialogue, where we candirectly engage with them. And my expectation is, in the coming months, we will be looking for openings thatcan be created where we can start sitting across the table, face to face; of diplomatic overtures that willallow us to move our policy in a new direction. There's been a lot of mistrust built up over the years, so it's not going to happen overnight. And it's important that even as we engage in this direct diplomacy, we are very clear about certain deepconcerns that we have as a country, that Iran understands that we find the funding of terrorist organizationsunacceptable, that we're clear about the fact that a nuclear Iran could set off a nuclear arms race in theregion that would be profoundly destabilizing. So there are going to be a set of objectives that we have inthese conversations, but I think that there's the possibility, at least, of a relationship of mutual respect andprogress.The latest on President Obama, the new administration and other news from Washington and around thenation.And I think that if you look at how we've approached the Middle East, my designation of George Mitchell asa special envoy to help deal with the Arab-Israeli situation, some of the interviews that I've given, it indicatesthe degree to which we want to do things differently in the region. Now it's time for Iran to send some signalsthat it wants to act differently as well and recognize that even as it is has some rights as a member of theinternational community, with those rights come responsibilities. Okay. MR. OBAMA: Chip Reid. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. You have often said that bipartisanship is extraordinarily important overall and in this stimulus package. Butnow when we ask your advisers about the lack of bipartisanship so far -- zero votes in the House, three inthe Senate -- they say, well, it's not the number of votes that matters; it's the number of jobs that will becreated.Is that a sign that you are moving away, your White House is moving away, from this emphasis onbipartisanship? And what went wrong? Did you underestimate how hard it would be to change the wayWashington worked? MR. OBAMA: I don't think -- I don't think I underestimated it. I don't think the American peopleunderestimated it. They understand that there have been a lot of bad habits built up here in Washington.And it's going to take time to break down some of those bad habits. You know, when I made a series of overtures to the Republicans -- going over to meet with both Republicancaucuses, you know, putting three Republicans in my Cabinet, something that is unprecedented, makingsure that they were invited here to the White House, to talk about the economic recovery plan -- all thosewere not designed simply to get some short-term votes. They were designed to try to build up some trustover time. And I think that, as I continue to make these overtures, over time, hopefully that will be reciprocated. But understand the bottom line that I've got right now, which is what's happening to the people of Elkhartand what's happening across the country. I can't afford to see Congress play the usual political games.What we have to do right now is deliver for the American people. So my bottom line when it comes to therecovery package is send me a bill that creates or saves 4 million jobs, because everybody has to bepossessed with a sense of urgency about putting people back to work, making sure that folks are staying intheir homes, that they can send their kids to college. That doesn't negate the continuing efforts that I'm going to make to listen and engage with my Republicancolleagues. And hopefully the tone that I've taken, which has been consistently civil and respectful, will paysome dividends over the long term. There are going to be areas where we disagree and there are going to be areas where we agree. As I said, the one concern I've got on the stimulus package, in terms of the debate and listening to some ofwhat's been said in Congress is that there seems to be a set of folks who -- I don't doubt their sincerity --who just believe that we should do nothing. Now, if that's their opening position or their closing position innegotiations, then we're probably not going to make much progress, because I don't think that'seconomically sound and I don't think what -- that's what the American people expect, is for us to stand byand do nothing. There are others who recognize that we've got to do a significant recovery package but they're concernedabout the mix of what's in there. And if they're sincere about it, then I'm happy to have conversations aboutthis tax cut versus that -- that tax cut or this infrastructure project versus that infrastructure project.The latest on President Obama, the new administration and other news from Washington and around thenation.But what I -- what I've been concerned about is some of the language that's been used suggesting that thisis full of pork and this is wasteful government spending, so on and so forth. First of all, when I hear that fromfolks who presided over a doubling of the national debt, then, you know, I just want them to not engage insome revisionist history. I inherited the deficit that we have right now and the economic crisis that we haveright now. Number two is that, although there are some programs in there that I think are good policy, some of themaren't job creators. I think it's perfectly legitimate to say that those programs should be out of this particularrecovery package, and we can deal with them later. But when they start characterizing this as pork without acknowledging that there are no earmarks in thispackage -- something, again, that was pretty rare over the last eight years -- then you get a feeling thatmaybe we're playing politics instead of actually trying to solve problems for the American people. So I'm going to keep on engaging. I hope that as we get the Senate and the House bills together, thateverybody is willing to give a little bit. I suspect that the package that emerges is not going to be a hundredpercent of what I want. But my bottom line is, are we creating 4 million jobs, and are we laying thefoundation for long- term economic growth? This is another concern that I've had in some of the arguments that I'm hearing. When people suggest thatwhat a waste of money to make federal buildings more energy-efficient -- why would that be a waste ofmoney? We're creating jobs immediately by retrofitting these buildings or weatherizing 2 million Americans'homes, as was called for in the package. So that right there creates economic stimulus, and we are savingtaxpayers, when it comes to federal buildings, potentially $2 billion. In the case of homeowners, they will seemore money in their pockets. And we're reducing our dependence on foreign oil in the Middle East. Whywouldn't we want to make that kind of investment? Now, maybe philosophically you just don't think that the federal government should be involved in energypolicy. I happen to disagree with that. I think that's the reason why we find ourselves importing more foreignoil right now than we did back in the early '70s, when OPEC first formed. And we can have a respectfuldebate about whether or not we should be involved in energy policymaking, but don't suggest that somehowthat's wasteful spending. That's exactly what this country needs. The same applies when it comes to information technologies and health care. We know that health care iscrippling businesses and making us less competitive, as well as breaking the banks of families all acrossAmerica. And part of the reason is we've got the most inefficient health care system imaginable. We're stillusing paper. We're -- we're still filing things in triplicate. Nurses can't read the prescriptions that doctors --that doctors have written out. Why wouldn't we want to put that on an -- put that on an electronic medicalrecord that will reduce error rates, reduce our long-term cost of health care, and create jobs right now? Education, yet another example. The suggestion is, why should the federal government be involved inschool construction? Well, I visited a school down in South Carolina that was built in the 1850s. Kids are stilllearning in that school -- as best they can. When the -- when the railroad -- when the -- it's right next to arailroad, and when the train runs by the whole building shakes and the teacher has to stop teaching for awhile.The -- The auditorium is completely broken down and they can't use it. So why wouldn't we want to buildstate-of-the-art schools with science labs that are teaching our kids the skills they need for the 21st century,that will enhance our economy and, by the way, right now will create jobs?The latest on President Obama, the new administration and other news from Washington and around thenation.So, you know, we can differ on some of the particulars, but again, the question I think that the Americanpeople are asking is, do you just want government to do nothing, or do you want it to do something? If youwant it to do something, then we can have a conversation. But doing nothing -- that's not an option from myperspective. All right. Chuck Todd. Where's Chuck? QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. In your opening remarks, you talked about that if your plan works theway you want it to work, it's going to increase consumer spending. But isn't consumer spending, or over-spending, how we got into this mess? And if people get money back into their pockets, do you not wantthem saving it or paying down debt first, before they start spending money into the economy? MR. OBAMA: Well, first of all, I don't think it's accurate to say that consumer spending got us into this mess.What got us into this mess initially were banks taking exorbitant, wild risks with other people's monies,based on shaky assets. And because of the enormous leverage, where they had $1 worth of assets andthey were betting $30 on that $1, what we had was a crisis in the financial system. That led to a contraction of credit, which in turn meant businesses couldn't make payroll or makeinventories, which meant that everybody became uncertain about the future of the economy. So people started making decisions accordingly, reducing investments, initiating layoffs, which in turn madethings worse. Now, you are making a legitimate point, Chuck, about the fact that our savings rate has declined. And thiseconomy has been driven by consumer spending for a very long time. And that's not going to besustainable. You know, if all we're doing is spending and we're not making things, then over time, othercountries are going to get tired of lending us money. And eventually the party's going to be over. Well, in fact, the party now is over. And so the sequence of how we're approaching this is as follows. Ourimmediate job is to stop the downward spiral. And that means putting money into consumers' pockets. Itmeans loosening up credit. It means putting forward investments that not only employ people immediately but also lay the groundworkfor long-term economic growth. And that by the way is important, even if you're a fiscal conservative,because the biggest problem we're going to have, with our federal budget, is if we continue a situation inwhich there are no tax revenues, because economic growth is plummeting at the same time as we've gotmore demands for unemployment insurance; we've got more demands for people who've lost their health care, more demand for food stamps. That will put enormous strains on the federal budget as well as thestate budget. So the most important thing we can do for our budget crisis right now is to make sure that the economydoesn't continue to tank. And that's why passing the Economic Recovery Plan is the right thing to do, eventhough I recognize that it's expensive.The latest on President Obama, the new administration and other news from Washington and around thenation.Look, I would love not to have to spend money right now. I'd -- you know, this notion that somehow I camein here just ginned up to spend $800 billion, you know, that -- that wasn't -- that wasn't how I envisioned mypresidency beginning. But we have to adapt to existing circumstances. Now, what we are going to also have to do is to make sure that as soon as the economy stabilizes,investment begins again; we're no longer contracting, but we're growing; that our midterm and long-termbudget is dealt with. And I think the same is true for individual consumers. Right now, they're just -- they'rejust trying to figure out how do I make sure that if I lose my job, you know, I'm still going to be able to makemy mortgage payments. Or they're worried about, how am I going to pay next month's bills? So they're not engaging in a lot of long-term financial planning. Once the economy stabilizes and people are less fearful, then I do think that we're going to have to startthinking about how do we operate more prudently, because there's no such thing as a free lunch. So if -- ifyou want to get -- if you want to buy a house, then putting zero down and buying a house that is probablynot affordable for you in case something goes wrong, that's something that has to be reconsidered. So we're going to have to change our -- our bad habits. But right now, the key is making sure that we pullourselves out of the economic slump that we're in. All right. Julianna Goldman, Bloomberg. QUESTION Thank you, Mr. President. Many experts, from Nouriel Roubini to Senator Schumer, have said that it will cost the government morethan a trillion dollars to really fix the financial system. During the campaign, you promised the Americanpeople that you won't just tell them what they want to hear, but what they need to hear. Won't thegovernment need far more than the $350 billion that's remaining in the financial rescue fund to really solvethe credit crisis? MR. OBAMA: Well, the credit crisis is real. And it's not over. I mean, we averted catastrophe by passing theTARP legislation. But as I said before, because of a lack of clarity and consistency in how it was applied, alack of oversight in -- in -- in how the money went out, we didn't get as a big of a bang for the buck as weshould have.My immediate task is making sure that the second half of that money, $350 billion, is spent properly. That'smy first job. Before I even think about what else I've got to do, my first task is to make sure that my secretaryof the Treasury, Tim Geithner, working with Larry Summers, my national economic adviser, and others, arecoming up with the best possible plan to use this money wisely, in a way that's transparent, in a way thatprovides clear oversight; that we are conditioning any money that we give to banks on them reducingexecutive compensation to reasonable levels and to make sure that they're not wasting that money. We are going to have to work with the banks in an effective way to clean up their balance sheets so thatsome trust is restored within the marketplace, because right now part of the problem is that nobody reallyknows what's on the banks' books. Any given bank, they're not sure what kinds of losses are there. We'vegot to open things up and restore some trust. We also have to deal with the housing issue in a clear and consistent way.I don't want to preempt my secretary of the Treasury; he's going to be laying out these principles in greatdetail tomorrow. But my instruction to him has been let's get this right, let's create a template in which we'rerestoring market confidence. And the reason that's so important is because we don't know yet whether we'regoing to need additional money or how much additional money we'll need until we've seen how successfulwe are at restoring a sense of confidence in a marketplace that the federal government and the FederalReserve Bank and the FDIC, working in concert, know what they're doing.The latest on President Obama, the new administration and other news from Washington and around thenation.That can make a big difference, in terms of whether or not we attract private capital back into themarketplace. And ultimately the government cannot substitute for all the private capital that has beenwithdrawn from the system. We've got to restore confidence, so that private capital goes back in. Okay. Jake. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. My question follows Julianna's in content. The American people have seen hundreds of billions of dollars spent already. And still the economycontinues to free-fall. Beyond avoiding the national catastrophe that you've warned about, once all the legsof your stool are in place-- MR. OBAMA: Right. QUESTION: -- how can the American people gauge whether or not your programs are working?Can they -- should they be looking at the metric of the stock market, home foreclosures, unemployment?What metric should they use? When? And how will they know if it's working or whether or not we need to goto a Plan B? MR. OBAMA: I think my initial measure of success is creating or saving 4 million jobs. That's bottom linenumber one, because if people are working, then they've got enough confidence to make purchases, tomake investments. Businesses start seeing that consumers are out there with a little more confidence. Andthey start making investments, which means they start hiring workers. So step number one, job creation. Step number two, are we seeing the credit markets operate effectively? You know, I can't tell you how manybusinesses that I talk to that are successful businesses but just can't get credit. Part of the problem inElkhart that I heard about today was the fact that this is the RV capital of America. You've got a bunch of RVcompanies that have customers who want to purchase RVs, but even though their credit is good, they can'tget the loan. Now, the businesses also can't get loans to make payments to their suppliers. But when they haveconsumers, consumers can't get the loans that they need. So normalizing the credit markets is, I think, stepnumber two. Step number three is going to be housing. Have we stabilized the housing market? Now, you know, thefederal government doesn't have complete control over that. But if our plan is effective, working with theFederal Reserve Bank, working with the FDIC, I think what we can do is stem the rate of foreclosure and wecan start stabilizing housing values over time. And the most -- the biggest measure of success is whether we stop contracting and shedding jobs, and westart growing again. Now, you know, I don't have a crystal ball, and as I said, this is an unprecedented crisis.But my hope is that after a difficult year -- and this year is going to be a difficult year -- that businesses startinvesting again, they start making decisions that, you know, in fact, there's money to be made out there;customers -- or consumers start feeling that their jobs are stable and safe, and they start making purchasesagain. And if we get things right then, starting next year, we can start seeing some significant improvement. Ed Henry. Where's Ed? CNN. There he is. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. You've promised to send more troops to Afghanistan. And sinceyou've been very clear about a time table to withdraw our combat troops from Iraq within 16 months, Iwonder what's your time table to withdraw troops eventually from Afghanistan?The latest on President Obama, the new administration and other news from Washington and around thenation.And related to that, there's a Pentagon policy that bans media coverage of the flag-draped coffins fromcoming into Dover Air Force Base. And back in 2004, then-Senator Joe Biden said that it was shameful fordead soldiers to be, quote, snuck back into the country under the cover of night.You've promised unprecedented transparency, openness in your government. Will you overturn that policy,so the American people can see the full human cost of war? MR. OBAMA: Your question is timely. We got reports that four American service members have been killedin Iraq today. And you know, obviously our thoughts and prayers go out to the families. I've said before that, you know, people have asked me, ""When did it hit you that you are now president?""And what I told them was the most sobering moment is signing letters to the families of our fallen heroes. Itreminds you of the responsibilities that you carry in this office and the consequences of decisions that youmake. Now with respect to the policy of opening up media to loved ones being brought back home, we are in theprocess of reviewing those policies in conversations with the Department of Defense. So I don't want to giveyou an answer now, before I've evaluated that review and understand all the implications involved. With respect to Afghanistan, this is going to be a big challenge. I think, because of the extraordinary workdone by our troops and some very good diplomatic work done by Ambassador Crocker in Iraq, we just sawan election in Iraq that went relatively peacefully, and you get a sense that the political system is nowfunctioning in a meaningful way. You do not see that yet in Afghanistan. They've got elections coming up, but effectively the nationalgovernment seems very detached from what's going on in the surrounding community. In addition, you'vegot the Taliban and al Qaeda operating in the FATA and these border regions between Afghanistan andPakistan. And what we haven't seen is the kind of concerted effort to root out those safe havens that wouldultimately make our mission successful. So we are undergoing a thorough-going review. Not only is General Petraeus, now the head of CENTCOM,conducting his own review, he's now working in concert with the special envoy that I've sent over -- RichardHolbrooke, one of our top diplomats -- to evaluate a regional approach. We are going to need more effectivecoordination of our military efforts with diplomatic efforts with development efforts with more effectivecoordination with our allies in order for us to be successful. The bottom line, though -- and I just want to remember the American people, because this is going to bedifficult -- is this is a situation in which a region served as the base to launch an attack that killed 3,000Americans. And this past week I met with families of those who were lost in 9/11, a reminder of the costs ofallowing those safe havens to exist. My bottom line is that we cannot allow al Qaeda to operate. We cannot have those safe havens in thatregion. And we're going to have to work both smartly and effectively, but with consistency, in order to makesure that those safe havens don't exist. I do not have yet a timetable for how long that's going to take. What I know is I'm not going to make -- I'mnot going to allow al Qaeda or bin Laden to operate with impunity planning attacks on the U.S. homeland.All right.The latest on President Obama, the new administration and other news from Washington and around thenation.Helene Cooper. Where is Helene? Here you go. QUESTION: Thank you, sir. I wanted to ask you, on the next bank bailout, are you going to impose a requirement that the financialinstitutions use this money to loosen up credit and make new lending? And if not, how do you make thecase to the American people that this bailout will work when the last one didn't? MR. OBAMA: Again, Helene, I -- I -- and I'm trying to avoid preempting my secretary of the Treasury; I wantall of you to show up at his press conference as well. (Laughter.) He's going to be terrific. But this relates to Jake's earlier question. One of my bottom lines is whether or not credit is flowing to thepeople who need it. Is it flowing to banks? Is -- excuse me; is it flowing to businesses, large and small? Is itflowing to consumers? Are they able to operate in ways that translate into jobs and economic growth onMain Street? And the package that we've put together is designed to help do that. And beyond that, I'm going to makesure that Tim gets his moment in the sun tomorrow, all right? Major Garrett. Where is Major? QUESTION: Mr. President, at a speech Friday that many of us covered, Vice President Biden said thefollowing thing about a conversation the two of you had in the Oval Office about a subject he didn't disclose.""If we do everything right, if we do it with absolute certainty, if we stand up there and we really make thetough decisions, there's still a 30 percent chance we're going to get it wrong."" Since the vice president brought it up, can you tell the American people, sir, what you were talking about?And if not, can you at least reassure them it wasn't the stimulus bill or the bank rescue plan and if in generalyou agree with that ratio of success, 30 percent failure, 70 percent success? MR. OBAMA: (Laughs.) You know, I don't remember exactly what Joe was referring to, not surprisingly.(Laughter.) But let me try this out. I think what Joe may have been suggesting, although I wouldn't put numerical -- I would ascribe anynumerical percentage to any of this, is that given the magnitude of the challenges that we have, any singlething that we do is going to be part of the solution, not all of the solution. And as I said in my introductory remarks, not everything we do is going to work out exactly as we intended itto work out. This is an unprecedented problem. And you know, when you talk to economists, there's somegeneral sense of how we're going to move forward. There's some strong consensus about the need for a recovery package of a certain magnitude. There's astrong consensus that you shouldn't put all your eggs in one basket, all tax cuts or all investment, but thatthere should be a range of approaches. But even if we do everything right on that, we've still got to deal with what we just talked about, the financialsystem and making sure that banks are lending again. We're still going to have to deal with housing. We'restill going to have to make sure that we've got a regulatory structure -- a regulatory architecture for thefinancial system that prevents crises like this from occurring again. Those are all big, complicated tasks. So I don't know whether Joe was referring to that, but I use that as a launching point to make a generalpoint about these issues. MR. OBAMA: I have no idea. I really don't. Michael Fletcher, The Washington Post. QUESTION: Yeah, thank you, sir. What's you're reaction to Alex Rodriguez's admission that he usedsteroids as a member of the Texas Rangers? MR. OBAMA: Yeah, I think it's depressing news on top of what's been a flurry of depressing items, when itcomes to Major League Baseball. And if you're a fan of Major League Baseball, I think it -- it tarnishes an entire era, to some degree. And it'sunfortunate, because I think there are a lot of ballplayers who played it straight.The latest on President Obama, the new administration and other news from Washington and around thenation.And you know, the thing I'm probably most concerned about the message that it sends to our kids. What I'm pleased about is, Major League Baseball seems to finally be taking this seriously, to recognizehow big of a problem this is for the sport, and that our kids hopefully are watching and saying: You knowwhat? There are no shortcuts; that when you try to take shortcuts, you may end up tarnishing your entirecareer, and that your integrity's not worth it. That's the message I hope is communicated. All right. Helen. This is my inaugural moment here. (Laughter.) I'm really excited. QUESTION: Mr. President, do you think that Pakistan and -- are maintaining the safe havens in Afghanistanfor these so-called terrorists? And also, do you know of any country in the Middle East that has nuclearweapons? MR. OBAMA: Well, I think that Pakistan -- there is no doubt that in the FATA region of Pakistan, in themountainous regions along the border of Afghanistan, that there are safe havens where terrorists areoperating.And one of the goals of Ambassador Holbrooke as he is traveling throughout the region is to deliver amessage to Pakistan that they are endangered as much as we are by the continuation of those operations,and that we've got to work in a regional fashion to root out those safe havens. They're -- it's not acceptable for Pakistan or for us to have folks who, with impunity, will kill innocent men,women and children. And you know, I -- I believe that the new government of Pakistan and -- and Mr. Zardari cares deeply aboutgetting control of this situation, and we want to be effective partners with them on that issue. QUESTION: Did you get any promise from them? MR. OBAMA: Well, Mr. Holbrooke is there, and that's exactly why he's being sent there, because I think thatwe have to make sure that Pakistan is a stalwart ally with us in battling this terrorist threat. With respect to nuclear weapons, you know, I don't want to speculate. What I know is this: that if we see anuclear arms race in a region as volatile as the Middle East, everybody will be in danger. And one of my goals is to prevent nuclear proliferation generally. I think that it's important for the United States, in concert with Russia, to lead the way on this. And you know,I've mentioned this in conversations with the Russian president, Mr. Medvedev, to let him know that it isimportant for us to restart the conversation, about how we can start reducing our nuclear arsenals in aneffective way, so that -- MR. OBAMA: -- so that we then have the standing to go to other countries and start stitching back togetherthe non- proliferation treaties that frankly have been weakened over the last several years. Okay. All right. Sam Stein, Huffington Post. Where's Sam? QUESTION: Right here. MR. OBAMA: There. Go ahead. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. Today, Senator Patrick Leahy announced that he wants to set up a truth and reconciliation committee toinvestigate the misdeeds of the Bush administration. He said that before you turn the page, you have to read -- read the page first. Do you agree with such aproposal? And are you willing to rule out right here and now any prosecution of Bush administrationofficials? MR. OBAMA: I haven't seen the proposal, so I don't want to express an opinion on something that I haven'tseen. What I have said is that my administration is going to operate in a way that leaves no doubt that we do nottorture, that we abide by the Geneva Conventions, and that we observe our traditions of rule of law and dueprocess as we are vigorously going after terrorists that can do us harm. And I don't think those arecontradictory; I think they are potentially complementary. My view is also that nobody's above the law, and if there are clear instances of wrongdoing, that peopleshould be prosecuted just like any ordinary citizen. But that generally speaking, I'm more interested inlooking forward than I am in looking backwards. I want to pull everybody together, including, by the way, the-- all the members of the intelligence community who have done things the right way and have been workinghard to protect America, and I think sometimes are painted with a broad brush, without adequateinformation.The latest on President Obama, the new administration and other news from Washington and around thenation.So I will take a look at Senator Leahy's proposal, but my general orientation is to say let's get it right movingforward. Mara Liasson. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. If it's this hard to get more than a handful of Republican votes onwhat is relatively easy -- spending tons of money and cutting people's taxes -- when you look down the roadat health care and entitlement reform and energy reform, those are really tough choices. You're going to beasking some people to get less, and some people to pay more. What do you think you're going to have to do to get more bipartisanship? Are you going to need a newlegislative model, bringing in Republicans from the very beginning, getting more involved in the detailsyourself from the beginning, or using bipartisan commissions? What has this experience with the stimulusled you to think about when you think about these future challenges? MR. OBAMA: Well, as I said before, Mara, I think that old habits are hard to break. And we're coming off ofan election and I think people want to sort of test the limits of what they can get. You know, there's a lot ofjockeying in this town and a lot of who's up and who's down and positioning for the next election. And whatI've tried to suggest is that this is one of those times where we've got to put that kind of behavior aside,because the American people can't afford it. The people in Elkhart can't afford it. The single mom who'strying to figure out how to keep her house can't afford it. And whether we're Democrats or Republicans, surely there's got to be some capacity for us to work together-- not agree on everything, but at least set aside small differences to get things done. Now, just in terms of the historic record here, the Republicans were brought in early and were consulted.And you'll remember that when we initially introduced our framework, they were pleasantly surprised andcomplimentary about the tax cuts that were presented in that framework. Those tax cuts are still in there. I mean, I suppose what I could have done is started off with no tax cuts, knowing that I was going to wantsome, and then let them take credit for all of them. And maybe that's the lesson I learned. But there wasconsultation. There will continue to be consultation. One thing that I think is important is to recognize that because all these -- all these items that you listed arehard, that people have to break out of some of the ideological rigidity and gridlock that we've been carryingaround for too long. And let me give you a prime example. When it comes to how we approach the issue of fiscal responsibility, again, it's a little hard for me to takecriticism from folks, about this recovery package, after they presided over a doubling of the national debt.I'm not sure they have a lot of credibility when it comes to fiscal responsibility. Having said that, I think there are a lot of Republicans who are sincere in recognizing that unless we dealwith entitlements in a serious way, the problems we have, with this year's deficit and next year's deficit, palein comparison to what we're going to be seeing 10 or 15 years or 20 years down the road. Both Democrats and Republicans are going to have to think differently in order to come together and solvethat problem. I think there are areas like education, where some in my party have been too resistant to reform, and haveargued only money makes a difference. And there have been others on the Republican side or theconservative side who said, no matter how much money you spend, nothing makes a difference, so let's justblow up the public school systems. And -- and I think that both sides are going to have to acknowledgewe're going to need more money for new science labs, to pay teachers more effectively. But we're alsogoing to need more reform, which means that we've got to train teachers more effectively; bad teachersneed to be fired after being given the opportunity to train effectively; that we should experiment with thingslike charter schools that are innovating in the classroom; that we should have high standards. So my whole goal over the next four years is to make sure that whatever arguments are persuasive andbacked up by evidence and facts and proof, that they can work, that we are pulling people together aroundthat kind of pragmatic agenda. And I think that there was an opportunity to do this with this recoverypackage because, as I said, although there are some politicians who are arguing that we don't need astimulus, there are very few economists who are making that argument. I mean, you've got economists whowere advising John McCain, economists who were advisers to George Bush -- one and two -- all suggestingthat we actually needed a serious recovery package. And so when I hear people just saying we don't need to do anything; this is a spending bill, not a stimulusbill, without acknowledging that by definition part of any stimulus package would include spending -- that'sthe point -- then what I get a sense of is that there is some ideological blockage there that needs to becleared up. But I am the eternal optimist. I think that over time people respond to -- to civility and rational argument. Ithink that's what the people of Elkhart and people around America are looking for, and that's what I'm --that's the kind of leadership I'm going to try to provide. All right?Thank you, guys.",obama
"Thank you. Pease, be seated. Thank you, very much.Madam Speaker, Leader Reid, members of Congress, dear friends, former colleagues:It is a great honor to be here -- a place where Lincoln served, was inaugurated, and where thenation he saved bid him a last farewell. As we mark the bicentennial of our 16th President'sbirth, I cannot claim to know as much about his life and works as many who are also speakingtoday, but I can say that I feel a special gratitude to this singular figure who in so many waysmade my own story possible -- and in so many ways made America's story possible.It is fitting that we are holding this celebration here at the Capitol, for the life of this buildingis bound ever so closely to the times of this immortal President. Built by artisans andcraftsmen, but also immigrants and slaves, it was here, in the rotunda, that Union soldiersreceived help from a makeshift hospital; it was downstairs, in the basement, that they werebaked bread to give them strength; and it was in the Senate and House chambers where theyslept at night and spent some of their days.What those soldiers saw when they looked on this building was a very different sight than theone we see today, for it remained unfinished until the end of the war. The laborers who builtthe dome came to work wondering each day whether that would be their last; whether themetal they were using for its frame would be requisitioned for the war and melted down intobullets. But each day went by without any orders to halt construction, and so they kept onworking, and kept on building.And when President Lincoln was finally told of all the metal being used here, his response wasshort and clear: That is as it should be. The American people needed to be reminded, hebelieved, that even in a time of war, the work would go on; the people's business wouldcontinue; that even when the nation itself was in doubt, its future was being secured; andthat on that distant day, when the guns fell silent, a national capitol would stand, with astatue of freedom at its peak, as a symbol of unity in a land still mending its divisions.It is this sense of unity, this ability to plan for a shared future even at a moment where ournation was torn apart, that I reflect on today. And while there are any number of momentsthat reveal that particular side of this extraordinary man, Abraham Lincoln -- that particularaspect of his leadership -- there's one that I'd like to share with you today.In the war's final weeks, aboard Grant's flagship, The River Queen, President Lincoln wasasked what was to be done with the rebel armies once General Lee surrendered. With victoryat hand, Lincoln could have sought revenge. He could have forced the South to pay a steepprice for their rebellion. But despite all the bloodshed and all the misery that each side hadexacted upon the other, and despite his absolute certainty in the rightness of the cause ofending slavery, no Confederate soldier was to be punished, Lincoln ordered. They were to betreated, as he put it, ""liberally all round."" What Lincoln wanted was for Confederate troops togo back home and return to work on their farms and in their shops. He was even willing, hesaid, to ""let them have their horses to plow and their guns to shoot crows with.""That was the only way, Lincoln knew, to repair the rifts that had torn this country apart. Itwas the only way to begin the healing that our nation so desperately needed. What Lincolnnever forgot, not even in the midst of civil war, was that despite all that divides us -- northand south, black and white -- we were, at heart, one nation and one people, sharing a bondas Americans that could bend but would not break.And so even as we meet here today, in a moment when we are far less divided than inLincoln's day, but when we are once again debating the critical issues of our time -- anddebating them sometimes fiercely -- let us remember that we are doing so as servants of thesame flag, as representatives of the same people, and as stakeholders in a common future.That is the most fitting tribute we can pay -- the most lasting monument we can build -- tothat most remarkable of men, Abraham Lincoln.Thank you.",obama

"I also want to acknowledge all of our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.That includes the Camp Lejeune Marines now serving with -- or soon joining -- the Second MarineExpeditionary Force in Iraq; those with Special Purpose Marine Air Ground Task Force in Afghanistan; andthose among the 8,000 Marines who are preparing to deploy to Afghanistan. We have you in our prayers.We pay tribute to your service. We thank you and your families for all that you do for America. And I want allof you to know that there is no higher honor or greater responsibility than serving as your Commander-in-Chief.I also want to take this opportunity to acknowledge Ryan Crocker, who recently completed his service as ourAmbassador to Iraq. Throughout his career, Ryan always took on the toughest assignments. He is anexample of the very best that this nation has to offer, and we owe him a great debt of gratitude. He carriedon his work with an extraordinary degree of cooperation with two of our finest Generals -- General DavidPetraeus, and General Ray Odierno -- who will be critical in carrying forward the strategy that I will outlinetoday.Next month will mark the sixth anniversary of the war in Iraq. By any measure, this has already been a longwar. For the men and women of Americas armed forces -- and for your families -- this war has been one ofthe most extraordinary chapters of service in the history of our nation. You have endured tour after tour aftertour of duty. You have known the dangers of combat and the lonely distance of loved ones. You have foughtagainst tyranny and disorder.You have bled for your best friends and for unknown Iraqis. And you have borne an enormous burden foryour fellow citizens, while extending a precious opportunity to the people of Iraq. Under toughcircumstances, the men and women of the United States military have served with honor, and succeededbeyond any expectation.  Today, I have come to speak to you about how the war in Iraq will end.To understand where we need to go in Iraq, it is important for the American people to understand where wenow stand. Thanks in great measure to your service, the situation in Iraq has improved. Violence has beenreduced substantially from the horrific sectarian killing of 2006 and 2007. Al Qaeda in Iraq has been dealt aserious blow by our troops and Iraqs Security Forces, and through our partnership with Sunni Arabs. Thecapacity of Iraqs Security Forces has improved, and Iraqs leaders have taken steps toward politicalaccommodation. The relative peace and strong participation in Januarys provincial elections sent apowerful message to the world about how far Iraqis have come in pursuing their aspirations through apeaceful political process. But let there be no doubt: Iraq is not yet secure, and there will be difficult days ahead. Violence will continueto be a part of life in Iraq. Too many fundamental political questions about Iraqs future remain unresolved.Too many Iraqis are still displaced or destitute. Declining oil revenues will put an added strain on agovernment that has had difficulty delivering basic services. Not all of Iraqs neighbors are contributing to itssecurity. Some are working at times to undermine it. And even as Iraqs government is on a surer footing, itis not yet a full partner -- politically and economically -- in the region, or with the international communityIn short, today there is a renewed cause for hope in Iraq, but that hope rests upon an emerging foundation.On my first full day in office, I directed my national security team to undertake a comprehensive review ofour strategy in Iraq to determine the best way to strengthen that foundation, while strengthening Americannational security. I have listened to my Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and commanders onthe ground. We have acted with careful consideration of events on the ground; with respect for the securityagreements between the United States and Iraq; and with a critical recognition that the long-term solution inIraq must be political -- not military. Because the most important decisions that have to be made about Iraqsfuture must now be made by Iraqis.We have also taken into account the simple reality that America can no longer afford to see Iraq in isolationfrom other priorities: we face the challenge of refocusing on Afghanistan and Pakistan; of relieving theburden on our military; and of rebuilding our struggling economy -- and these are challenges that we willmeet.Today, I can announce that our review is complete, and that the United States will pursue a new strategy toend the war in Iraq through a transition to full Iraqi responsibility.This strategy is grounded in a clear and achievable goal shared by the Iraqi people and the Americanpeople: an Iraq that is sovereign, stable, and self-reliant.To achieve that goal, we will work to promote an Iraqi government that is just, representative, andaccountable, and that provides neither support nor safe-haven to terrorists. We will help Iraq build new tiesof trade and commerce with the world. And we will forge a partnership with the people and government ofIraq that contributes to the peace and security of the region.What we will not do is let the pursuit of the perfect stand in the way of achievable goals. We cannot rid Iraqof all who oppose America or sympathize with our adversaries. We cannot police Iraqs streets until they arecompletely safe, nor stay until Iraqs union is perfected. We cannot sustain indefinitely a commitment thathas put a strain on our military, and will cost the American people nearly a trillion dollars. Americas menand women in uniform have fought block by block, province by province, year after year, to give the Iraqisthis chance to choose a better future. Now, we must ask the Iraqi people to seize it.  The first part of this strategy is therefore the responsible removal of our combat brigades from Iraq.As a candidate for President, I made clear my support for a timeline of 16 months to carry out thisdrawdown, while pledging to consult closely with our military commanders upon taking office to ensure thatwe preserve the gains weve made and protect our troops. Those consultations are now complete, and Ihave chosen a timeline that will remove our combat brigades over the next 18 months.Let me say this as plainly as I can: by August 31, 2010, our combat mission in Iraq will end.As we carry out this drawdown, my highest priority will be the safety and security of our troops and civiliansin Iraq. We will proceed carefully, and I will consult closely with my military commanders on the ground andwith the Iraqi government. There will surely be difficult periods and tactical adjustments. But our enemiesshould be left with no doubt: this plan gives our military the forces and the flexibility they need to support ourIraqi partners, and to succeed.After we remove our combat brigades, our mission will change from combat to supporting the Iraqigovernment and its Security Forces as they take the absolute lead in securing their country. As I have longsaid, we will retain a transitional force to carry out three distinct functions: training, equipping, and advisingIraqi Security Forces as long as they remain non-sectarian; conducting targeted counter-terrorism missions;and protecting our ongoing civilian and military efforts within Iraq. Initially, this force will likely be made up of35-50,000 U.S. troops.Through this period of transition, we will carry out further redeployments. And under the Status of ForcesAgreement with the Iraqi government, I intend to remove all U.S. troops from Iraq by the end of 2011. Wewill complete this transition to Iraqi responsibility, and we will bring our troops home with the honor that theyhave earned.As we responsibly remove our combat brigades, we will pursue the second part of our strategy: sustaineddiplomacy on behalf of a more peaceful and prosperous Iraq.The drawdown of our military should send a clear signal that Iraqs future is now its own responsibility. Thelong-term success of the Iraqi nation will depend upon decisions made by Iraqs leaders and the fortitude ofthe Iraqi people. Iraq is a sovereign country with legitimate institutions; America cannot -- and should not --take their place. However, a strong political, diplomatic, and civilian effort on our part can advance progressand help lay a foundation for lasting peace and security.This effort will be led by our new Ambassador to Iraq -- Chris Hill. From his time in the Peace Corps, to hiswork in Kosovo and Korea, Ambassador Hill has been tested, and he has shown the pragmatism and skillthat we need right now. He will be supported by the courageous and capable work of so many Americandiplomats and aid workers who are serving in Iraq.Going forward, we can make a difference on several fronts. We will work with the United Nations to supportnational elections, while helping Iraqis improve local government. We can serve as an honest broker inpursuit of fair and durable agreements on issues that have divided Iraqs leaders. And just as we will supportIraqs Security Forces, we will help Iraqi institutions strengthen their capacity to protect the rule of law,confront corruption, and deliver basic services.Diplomacy and assistance is also required to help the millions of displaced Iraqis. These men, women andchildren are a living consequence of this war and a challenge to stability in the region, and they mustbecome a part of Iraqs reconciliation and recovery. America has a strategic interest -- and a moralresponsibility -- to act. In the coming months, my administration will provide more assistance and take stepsto increase international support for countries already hosting refugees; well cooperate with others toresettle Iraqis facing great personal risk; and we will work with the Iraqi government over time to resettlerefugees and displaced Iraqis within Iraq -- because there are few more powerful indicators of lasting peacethan displaced citizens returning home.Now, before I go any further, I want to take a moment to speak directly to the people of Iraq.You are a great nation, rooted in the cradle of civilization. You are joined together by enduringaccomplishments, and a history that connects you as surely as the two rivers carved into your land. In yearspast, you have persevered through tyranny and terror; through personal insecurity and sectarian violence.And instead of giving in to the forces of disunion, you stepped back from a descent into civil war, andshowed a proud resilience that deserves respect.Our nations have known difficult times together. But ours is a bond forged by shared bloodshed, andcountless friendships among our people. We Americans have offered our most precious resource -- ouryoung men and women -- to work with you to rebuild what was destroyed by despotism; to root out ourcommon enemies; and to seek peace and prosperity for our children and grandchildren, and for yours.There are those who will try to prevent that future for Iraq -- who will insist that Iraqs differences cannot bereconciled without more killing. They represent the forces that destroy nations and lead only to despair, andthey will test our will in the months and years to come. America, too, has known these forces. We enduredthe pain of Civil War, and bitter divisions of region and race. But hostility and hatred are no match for justice;they offer no pathway to peace; and they must not stand between the people of Iraq and a future ofreconciliation and hope.So to the Iraqi people, let me be clear about Americas intentions. The United States pursues no claim onyour territory or your resources. We respect your sovereignty and the tremendous sacrifices you have madefor your country. We seek a full transition to Iraqi responsibility for the security of your country. And goingforward, we can build a lasting relationship founded upon mutual interests and mutual respect as Iraq takesits rightful place in the community of nations.That leads me to the third part of our strategy -- comprehensive American engagement across the region.The future of Iraq is inseparable from the future of the broader Middle East, so we must work with ourfriends and partners to establish a new framework that advances Iraqs security and the regions. It is timefor Iraq to be a full partner in a regional dialogue, and for Iraqs neighbors to establish productive andnormalized relations with Iraq. And going forward, the United States will pursue principled and sustainedengagement with all of the nations in the region, and that will include Iran and Syria.This reflects a fundamental truth: we can no longer deal with regional challenges in isolation -- we need asmarter, more sustainable and comprehensive approach. That is why we are renewing our diplomacy, whilerelieving the burden on our military. That is why we are refocusing on al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan;developing a strategy to use all elements of American power to prevent Iran from developing a nuclearweapon; and actively seeking a lasting peace between Israel and the Arab world.  And that is why we havenamed three of Americas most accomplished diplomats -- George Mitchell, Dennis Ross and RichardHolbrooke -- to support Secretary Clinton and me as we carry forward this agenda. Every nation and every group must know -- whether you wish America good or ill -- that the end of the war inIraq will enable a new era of American leadership and engagement in the Middle East. And that era has justbegun.Finally, I want to be very clear that my strategy for ending the war in Iraq does not end with military plans ordiplomatic agendas -- it endures through our commitment to uphold our sacred trust with every man andwoman who has served in Iraq.You make up a fraction of the American population, but in an age when so many people and institutionshave acted irresponsibly, you did the opposite -- you volunteered to bear the heaviest burden. And for youand for your families, the war does not end when you come home. It lives on in memories of your fellowsoldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines who gave their lives. It endures in the wound that is slow to heal, thedisability that isnt going away, the dream that wakes you at night, or the stiffening in your spine when a carbackfires down the street. You and your families have done your duty -- now a grateful nation must do ours. That is why I amincreasing the number of soldiers and Marines, so that we lessen the burden on those who are serving. Andthat is why I have committed to expanding our system of veterans health care to serve more patients, and toprovide better care in more places. We will continue building new wounded warrior facilities across America,and invest in new ways of identifying and treating the signature wounds of this war: Post-Traumatic StressDisorder and Traumatic Brain Injury, as well as other combat injuries.We also know that service does not end with the person wearing the uniform. In her visits with militaryfamilies across the country, my wife Michelle has learned firsthand about the unique burden that yourfamilies endure every day. I want you to know this: military families are a top priority for Michelle and me,and they will be a top priority for my administration. Well raise military pay, and continue providing qualitychild-care, job-training for spouses, and expanded counseling and outreach to families that have known theseparation and stress of war. We will also heed the lesson of history -- that those who fight in battle canform the backbone of our middle class -- by implementing a 21st century GI Bill to help our veterans livetheir dreams.As a nation, we have had our share of debates about the war in Iraq. It has, at times, divided us as apeople. To this very day, there are some Americans who want to stay in Iraq longer, and some who want toleave faster. But there should be no disagreement on what the men and women of our military haveachieved.And so I want to be very clear: We sent our troops to Iraq to do away with Saddam Husseins regime -- andyou got the job done. We kept our troops in Iraq to help establish a sovereign government -- and you got thejob done. And we will leave the Iraqi people with a hard-earned opportunity to live a better life -- that is yourachievement; that is the prospect that you have made possible.There are many lessons to be learned from what weve experienced. We have learned that America mustgo to war with clearly defined goals, which is why Ive ordered a review of our policy in Afghanistan. Wehave learned that we must always weigh the costs of action, and communicate those costs candidly to theAmerican people, which is why Ive put Iraq and Afghanistan into my budget. We have learned that in the21st century, we must use all elements of American power to achieve our objectives, which is why I amcommitted to building our civilian national security capacity so that the burden is not continually pushed onto our military. We have learned that our political leaders must pursue the broad and bipartisan support thatour national security policies depend upon, which is why I will consult with Congress and in carrying out myplans. And we have learned the importance of working closely with friends and allies, which is why we arelaunching a new era of engagement in the world.The starting point for our policies must always be the safety of the American people. I know that you -- themen and women of the finest fighting force in the history of the world -- can meet any challenge, and defeatany foe. And as long as I am your Commander-in-Chief, I promise you that I will only send you into harmsway when it is absolutely necessary, and provide you with the equipment and support you need to get thejob done. That is the most important lesson of all -- for the consequences of war are dire, the sacrificesimmeasurable.  You know because you have seen those sacrifices. You have lived them. And we all honor them.""Semper Fidelis"" -- it means always being faithful to Corps, and to country, and to the memory of fallencomrades like Corporal Jonathan Yale and Lance Corporal Jordan Haerter. These young men enlisted in atime of war, knowing they would face great danger. They came here, to Camp Lejeune, as they trained fortheir mission. And last April, they were standing guard in Anbar. In an age when suicide is a weapon, theywere suddenly faced with an oncoming truck filled with explosives. These two Marines stood their ground.These two Marines opened fire. And these two Marines stopped that truck. When the thousands of poundsof explosives detonated, they had saved fifty Marines and Iraqi police who would have been in the truckspath, but Corporal Yale and Lance Corporal Haerter lost their own lives. Jonathan was 21. Jordan was 19.In the town where Jordan Haerter was from, a bridge was dedicated in his name. One Marine who traveledto the ceremony said: ""We flew here from all over the country to pay tribute to our friend Jordan, who riskedhis life to save us. We wouldnt be here without him.""Americas time in Iraq is filled with stories of men and women like this. Their names are written into bridgesand town squares. They are etched into stones at Arlington, and in quiet places of rest across our land.They are spoken in schools and on city blocks. They live on in the memories of those who wear youruniform, in the hearts of those they loved, and in the freedom of the nation they served.Each American who has served in Iraq has their own story. Each of you has your own story. And that storyis now a part of the history of the United States of America -- a nation that exists only because free men andwomen have bled for it from the beaches of Normandy to the deserts of Anbar; from the mountains of Koreato the streets of Kandahar. You teach us that the price of freedom is great. Your sacrifice should challengeall of us -- every single American -- to ask what we can do to be better citizens.There will be more danger in the months ahead. We will face new tests and unforeseen trials. But thanks tothe sacrifices of those who have served, we have forged hard-earned progress, we are leaving Iraq to itspeople, and we have begun the work of ending this war. Thank you, God Bless you, and God Bless the United States of America. Semper Fi.",obama
"Please, everybody have a seat. Thank you for the wonderful introduction, David. And thankyou for the great work that you are doing each and every day. And I appreciate such a warmwelcome. Some of you I've gotten a chance to know; many of you I'm meeting for the firsttime. But the spirit of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the desire to create jobs andprovide opportunity to people who sometimes have been left out -- that's exactly what thisadministration is about. That's the essence of the American Dream. And so I'm very proud tohave a chance to speak with all of you.You know, every so often, throughout our history, a generation of Americans bears theresponsibility of seeing this country through difficult times and protecting the dream of itsfounding for posterity. This is a responsibility that's fallen to our generation. Meeting it willrequire steering our nation's economy through a crisis unlike anything that we have seen inour time. In the short term, that means jump-starting job creation and restarting lending, and restoringconfidence in our markets and our financial system. But it also means taking steps that notonly advance our recovery, but lay the foundation for lasting, shared prosperity.I know there's some who believe we can only handle one challenge at a time. And they forgetthat Lincoln helped lay down the transcontinental railroad and passed the Homestead Act andcreated the National Academy of Sciences in the midst of civil war. Likewise, PresidentRoosevelt didn't have the luxury of choosing between ending a depression and fighting a war;he had to do both. President Kennedy didn't have the luxury of choosing between civil rightsand sending us to the moon. And we don't have the luxury of choosing between getting oureconomy moving now and rebuilding it over the long term.America will not remain true to its highest ideals -- and America's place as a global economicleader will be put at risk -- unless we not only bring down the crushing cost of health care andtransform the way we use energy, but also if we do -- if we don't do a far better job thanwe've been doing of educating our sons and daughters; unless we give them the knowledgeand skills they need in this new and changing world.For we know that economic progress and educational achievement have always gone hand inhand in America. The land-grant colleges and public high schools transformed the economy ofan industrializing nation. The GI Bill generated a middle class that made America's economyunrivaled in the 20th century. Investments in math and science under President Eisenhowergave new opportunities to young scientists and engineers all across the country. It madepossible somebody like a Sergei Brin to attend graduate school and found an upstart companycalled Google that would forever change our world.The source of America's prosperity has never been merely how ably we accumulate wealth,but how well we educate our people. This has never been more true than it is today. In a21st-century world where jobs can be shipped wherever there's an Internet connection, wherea child born in Dallas is now competing with a child in New Delhi, where your best jobqualification is not what you do, but what you know -- education is no longer just a pathwayto opportunity and success, it's a prerequisite for success. That's why workers without a four-year degree have borne the brunt of recent layoffs, Latinosmost of all. That's why, of the 30 fastest growing occupations in America, half require aBachelor's degree or more. By 2016, four out of every 10 new jobs will require at least someadvanced education or training. So let there be no doubt: The future belongs to the nation that best educates its citizens --and my fellow Americans, we have everything we need to be that nation. We have the bestuniversities, the most renowned scholars. We have innovative principals and passionateteachers and gifted students, and we have parents whose only priority is their child'seducation. We have a legacy of excellence, and an unwavering belief that our children shouldclimb higher than we did.And yet, despite resources that are unmatched anywhere in the world, we've let our gradesslip, our schools crumble, our teacher quality fall short, and other nations outpace us. Let megive you a few statistics. In 8th grade math, we've fallen to 9th place. Singapore's middle-schoolers outperform ours three to one. Just a third of our 13- and 14-year-olds can read aswell as they should. And year after year, a stubborn gap persists between how well whitestudents are doing compared to their African American and Latino classmates. The relativedecline of American education is untenable for our economy, it's unsustainable for ourdemocracy, it's unacceptable for our children -- and we can't afford to let it continue.What's at stake is nothing less than the American Dream. It's what drew my father and somany of your fathers and mothers to our shores in pursuit of an education. It's what led LindaBrown and Gonzalo and Felicitas Mendez to bear the standard of all who were attendingseparate and unequal schools. It's what has led generations of Americans to take on thatextra job, to sacrifice the small pleasures, to scrimp and save wherever they can, in hopes ofputting away enough, just enough, to give their child the education that they never had. It'sthat most American of ideas, that with the right education, a child of any race, any faith, anystation, can overcome whatever barriers stand in their way and fulfill their God-givenpotential.Of course, we've heard all this year after year after year after year -- and far too little haschanged. Certainly it hasn't changed in too many overcrowded Latino schools; it hasn'tchanged in too many inner-city schools that are seeing dropout rates of over 50 percent. It'snot changing not because we're lacking sound ideas or sensible plans -- in pockets ofexcellence across this country, we're seeing what children from all walks of life can and willachieve when we set high standards, have high expectations, when we do a good job ofpreparing them. Instead, it's because politics and ideology have too often trumped ourprogress that we're in the situation that we're in. For decades, Washington has been trapped in the same stale debates that have paralyzedprogress and perpetuated our educational decline. Too many supporters of my party haveresisted the idea of rewarding excellence in teaching with extra pay, even though we know itcan make a difference in the classroom. Too many in the Republican Party have opposed newinvestments in early education, despite compelling evidence of its importance. So what we gethere in Washington is the same old debate about it's more money versus more reform,vouchers versus the status quo. There's been partisanship and petty bickering, but littlerecognition that we need to move beyond the worn fights of the 20th century if we're going tosucceed in the 21st century.I think you'd all agree that the time for finger-pointing is over. The time for holding us --holding ourselves accountable is here. What's required is not simply new investments, butnew reforms. It's time to expect more from our students. It's time to start rewarding goodteachers, stop making excuses for bad ones. It's time to demand results from government atevery level. It's time to prepare every child, everywhere in America, to out-compete anyworker, anywhere in the world. It's time to give all Americans a complete and competitive education from the cradle up through a career. We've accepted failure for far too long. Enoughis enough. America's entire education system must once more be the envy of the world -- andthat's exactly what we intend to do.That's exactly what the budget I'm submitting to Congress has begun to achieve. Now, at atime when we've inherited a trillion-dollar deficit, we will start by doing a little housekeeping,going through our books, cutting wasteful education programs. My outstanding Secretary ofEducation, Arne Duncan, who's here today -- stand up, Arne, so everybody can see you. I'massuming you also saw my Secretary of Labor, Hilda Solis. But Secretary Duncan will use onlyone test when deciding what ideas to support with your precious tax dollars: It's not whetheran idea is liberal or conservative, but whether it works. And this will help free up resources forthe first pillar of reforming our schools -- investing in early childhood initiatives.This isn't just about keeping an eye on our children, it's about educating them. Studies showthat children in early childhood education programs are more likely to score higher in readingand math, more likely to graduate from high school and attend college, more likely to hold ajob, and more likely to earn more in that job. For every dollar we invest in these programs,we get nearly $10 back in reduced welfare rolls, fewer health care costs, and less crime.That's why the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act that I signed into law invests $5billion in growing Early Head Start and Head Start, expanding access to quality child care for150,000 more children from working families, and doing more for children with special needs.And that's why we are going to offer 55,000 first-time parents regular visits from trainednurses to help make sure their children are healthy and prepare them for school and for life.Even as we invest in early childhood education, let's raise the bar for early learning programsthat are falling short. Now, today, some children are enrolled in excellent programs. Somechildren are enrolled in mediocre programs. And some are wasting away their most formativeyears in bad programs. That includes the one-fourth of all children who are Hispanic, and whowill drive America's workforce of tomorrow, but who are less likely to have been enrolled in anearly childhood education program than anyone else.That's why I'm issuing a challenge to our states: Develop a cutting-edge plan to raise thequality of your early learning programs; show us how you'll work to ensure that children arebetter prepared for success by the time they enter kindergarten. If you do, we will supportyou with an Early Learning Challenge Grant that I call on Congress to enact. That's how wewill reward quality and incentivize excellence, and make a down payment on the success ofthe next generation.So that's the first pillar of our education reform agenda. The second, we will end what hasbecome a race to the bottom in our schools and instead spur a race to the top by encouragingbetter standards and assessments. Now, this is an area where we are being outpaced by othernations. It's not that their kids are any smarter than ours -- it's that they are being smarterabout how to educate their children.They're spending less time teaching things that don't matter, and more time teaching thingsthat do. They're preparing their students not only for high school or college, but for a career.We are not. Our curriculum for 8th graders is two full years behind top performing countries.That's a prescription for economic decline. And I refuse to accept that America's childrencannot rise to this challenge. They can, and they must, and they will meet higher standards inour time. So let's challenge our states -- let's challenge our states to adopt world-class standards thatwill bring our curriculums to the 21st century. Today's system of 50 different sets ofbenchmarks for academic success means 4th grade readers in Mississippi are scoring nearly70 points lower than students in Wyoming -- and they're getting the same grade. Eight of ourstates are setting their standards so low that their students may end up on par with roughlythe bottom 40 percent of the world.That's inexcusable. That's why I'm calling on states that are setting their standards far belowwhere they ought to be to stop low-balling expectations for our kids. The solution to low testscores is not lowering standards -- it's tougher, clearer standards.  Standards like those inMassachusetts, where 8th graders are -- we have a Massachusetts contingent here. InMassachusetts, 8th graders are now tying for first -- first in the whole world in science. Otherforward-thinking states are moving in the same direction by coming together as part of aconsortium. And more states need to do the same. And I'm calling on our nation's governorsand state education chiefs to develop standards and assessments that don't simply measurewhether students can fill in a bubble on a test, but whether they possess 21st century skillslike problem-solving and critical thinking and entrepreneurship and creativity. That is what we'll help them do later this year -- that what we're going to help them do laterthis year when we finally make No Child Left Behind live up to its name by ensuring not onlythat teachers and principals get the funding that they need, but that the money is tied toresults.  And Arne Duncan will also back up this commitment to higher standards with a fundto invest in innovation in our school districts.Of course, raising standards alone will not make much of a difference unless we provideteachers and principals with the information they need to make sure students are prepared tomeet those standards. And far too few states have data systems like the one in Florida thatkeep track of a student's education from childhood through college. And far too few districtsare emulating the example of Houston and Long Beach, and using data to track how muchprogress a student is making and where that student is struggling. That's a resource that canhelp us improve student achievement, and tell us which students had which teachers so wecan assess what's working and what's not. That's why we're making a major investment inthis area that we will cultivate a new culture of accountability in America's schools.Now, to complete our race to the top requires the third pillar of reform -- recruiting,preparing, and rewarding outstanding teachers. From the moment students enter a school,the most important factor in their success is not the color of their skin or the income of theirparents, it's the person standing at the front of the classroom. That's why our Recovery Actwill ensure that hundreds of thousands of teachers and school personnel are not laid off --because those Americans are not only doing jobs they can't afford to lose, they're rendering aservice our nation cannot afford to lose, either. America's future depends on its teachers. And so today, I'm calling on a new generation ofAmericans to step forward and serve our country in our classrooms. If you want to make adifference in the life of our nation, if you want to make the most of your talents anddedication, if you want to make your mark with a legacy that will endure -- then join theteaching profession. America needs you. We need you in our suburbs. We need you in oursmall towns. We especially need you in our inner cities. We need you in classrooms all acrossour country.And if you do your part, then we'll do ours. That's why we're taking steps to prepare teachersfor their difficult responsibilities, and encourage them to stay in the profession. That's whywe're creating new pathways to teaching and new incentives to bring teachers to schoolswhere they're needed most. That's why we support offering extra pay to Americans who teachmath and science to end a teacher shortage in those subjects. It's why we're building on thepromising work being done in places like South Carolina's Teachers Advancement Program,and making an unprecedented commitment to ensure that anyone entrusted with educatingour children is doing the job as well as it can be done. Now, here's what that commitment means: It means treating teachers like the professionalsthey are while also holding them more accountable - in up to 150 more school districts. Newteachers will be mentored by experienced ones. Good teachers will be rewarded with moremoney for improved student achievement, and asked to accept more responsibilities for liftingup their schools. Teachers throughout a school will benefit from guidance and support to helpthem improve. And just as we've given our teachers all the support they need to be successful, we need tomake sure our students have the teacher they need to be successful. And that means statesand school districts taking steps to move bad teachers out of the classroom. But let me beclear -- Let me be clear -- the overwhelming number of teachers are doing an outstanding jobunder difficult circumstances. My sister is a teacher, so I know how tough teaching can be.But let me be clear: If a teacher is given a chance or two chances or three chances but stilldoes not improve, there's no excuse for that person to continue teaching. I reject a systemthat rewards failure and protects a person from its consequences. The stakes are too high. Wecan afford nothing but the best when it comes to our children's teachers and the schoolswhere they teach.Now, that leads me to the fourth part of America's education strategy - promoting innovationand excellence in America's schools. One of the places where much of that innovation occursis in our most effective charter schools. And these are public schools founded by parents,teachers, and civic or community organizations with broad leeway to innovate - schools Isupported as a state legislator and a United States senator. But right now, there are many caps on how many charter schools are allowed in some states,no matter how well they're preparing our students. That isn't good for our children, oureconomy, or our country. Of course, any expansion of charter schools must not result in thespread of mediocrity, but in the advancement of excellence. And that will require statesadopting both a rigorous selection and review process to ensure that a charter school'sautonomy is coupled with greater accountability - as well as a strategy, like the one inChicago, to close charter schools that are not working. Provided this greater accountability, Icall on states to reform their charter rules, and lift caps on the number of allowable charterschools, wherever such caps are in place.Now, even as we foster innovation in where our children are learning, let's also fosterinnovation in when our children are learning. We can no longer afford an academic calendardesigned for when America was a nation of farmers who needed their children at homeplowing the land at the end of each day. That calendar may have once made sense, but todayit puts us at a competitive disadvantage. Our children -- listen to this -- our children spendover a month less in school than children in South Korea -- every year. That's no way toprepare them for a 21st century economy. That's why I'm calling for us not only to expandeffective after-school programs, but to rethink the school day to incorporate more time -whether during the summer or through expanded-day programs for children who need it.Now, I know longer school days and school years are not wildly popular ideas.  Not with Maliaand Sasha -- not in my family, and probably not in yours. But the challenges of a new centurydemand more time in the classroom. If they can do that in South Korea, we can do it righthere in the United States of America.Of course, no matter how innovative our schools or how effective our teachers, Americacannot succeed unless our students take responsibility for their own education. That meansshowing up for school on time, paying attention in class, seeking out extra tutoring if it'sneeded, staying out of trouble. To any student who's watching, I say this: Don't even thinkabout dropping out of school. Don't even think about it. As I said a couple of weeks ago, dropping out is quitting on yourself, it's quitting on yourcountry, and it's not an option -- not anymore. Not when our high school dropout rate hastripled in the past 30 years. Not when high school dropouts earn about half as much ascollege graduates. Not when Latino students are dropping out faster than just about anyoneelse. It's time for all of us, no matter what our backgrounds, to come together and solve thisepidemic.Stemming the tide of dropouts will require turning around our low-performing schools. Just2,000 high schools in cities like Detroit and Los Angeles and Philadelphia produce over 50percent of America's dropouts. And yet there are too few proven strategies to transform theseschools. And there are too few partners to get the job done. So today, I'm issuing a challenge to educators and lawmakers, parents and teachers alike: Letus all make turning around our schools our collective responsibility as Americans. And that willrequire new investments in innovative ideas -- that's why my budget invests in developingnew strategies to make sure at-risk students don't give up on their education; new efforts togive dropouts who want to return to school the help they need to graduate; and new ways toput those young men and women who have left school back on a pathway to graduation. Now, the fifth part of America's education strategy is providing every American with a qualityhigher education - whether it's college or technical training. Never has a college degree beenmore important. Never has it been more expensive. And at a time when so many of ourfamilies are bearing enormous economic burdens, the rising cost of tuition threatens toshatter dreams. And that's why we will simplify federal college assistance forms so it doesn'ttake a Ph.D to apply for financial aid. That's why we're already taking steps to make college or technical training affordable. For thefirst time ever, Pell Grants will not be subject to the politics of the moment or the whim of themarket - they will be a commitment that Congress is required to uphold each and everyyear. Not only that; because rising costs mean Pell Grants cover less than half as much tuitionas they did 30 years ago, we're raising the maximum Pell Grant to $5,550 a year and indexingit above inflation. We're also providing a $2,500-a-year tuition tax credit for students fromworking families. And we're modernizing and expanding the Perkins Loan Program to makesure schools like UNLV don't get a tenth as many Perkins loans as schools like Harvard. To help pay for all of this, we're putting students ahead of lenders by eliminating wastefulstudent loan subsidies that cost taxpayers billions each year. All in all, we are making collegeaffordable for 7 million more students with a sweeping investment in our children's futuresand America's success. And I call on Congress to join me and the American people by makingthese investments possible. This is how we will help meet our responsibility as a nation to open the doors of college toevery American. But it will also be the responsibility of colleges and universities to controlspiraling costs. We can't just keep on putting more money in and universities and colleges notdoing their part to hold down tuitions. And it's the responsibility of our students to walkthrough the doors of opportunity. In just a single generation, America has fallen from 2nd place to 11th place in the portion ofstudents completing college. That is unfortunate, but it's by no means irreversible. Withresolve and the right investments, we can retake the lead once more.And that's why, in my address to the nation the other week, I called on Americans to committo at least one year or more of higher education or career training, with the goal of having thehighest proportion of college graduates in the world by the year 2020. And to meet that goal,we are investing $2.5 billion to identify and support innovative initiatives across the countrythat achieve results in helping students persist and graduate.So let's not stop at education with college. Let's recognize a 21st century reality: Learningdoesn't end in our early 20s. Adults of all ages need opportunities to earn new degrees andnew skills -- especially in the current economic environment. That means working with all ouruniversities and schools, including community colleges -- a great and undervalued asset -- toprepare workers for good jobs in high-growth industries; and to improve access to job trainingnot only for young people who are just starting their careers, but for older workers who neednew skills to change careers. And that's going to be one of the key tasks that Secretary Solisis involved with, is making sure that lifelong learning is a reality and a possibility for moreAmericans.It's through initiatives like these that we'll see more Americans earn a college degree, orreceive advanced training, and pursue a successful career. And that's why I'm calling onCongress to work with me to enact these essential reforms, and to reauthorize the WorkforceReinvestment Act. That's how we will round out a complete and competitive education in theUnited States of America.So here's the bottom line: Yes, we need more money; yes, we need more reform; yes, weneed to hold ourselves more accountable for every dollar we spend. But there's one moreingredient I want to talk about. No government policy will make any difference unless we alsohold ourselves more accountable as parents -- because government, no matter how wise orefficient, cannot turn off the TV or put away the video games. Teachers, no matter howdedicated or effective, cannot make sure your child leaves for school on time and does theirhomework when they get back at night. These are things only a parent can do. These arethings that our parents must do.I say this not only as a father, but also as a son. When I was a child my mother and I livedoverseas, and she didn't have the money to send me to the fancy international school whereall the American kids went to school. So what she did was she supplemented my schoolingwith lessons from a correspondence course. And I can still picture her waking me up at 4:30a.m., five days a week, to go over some lessons before I went to school. And whenever I'dcomplain and grumble and find some excuse and say, ""Awww, I'm sleepy,"" she'd patientlyrepeat to me her most powerful defense. She'd say, ""This is no picnic for me either, buster.""And when you're a kid you don't think about the sacrifices they're making. She had to work; Ijust had to go to school. But she'd still wake up every day to make sure I was getting what Ineeded for my education.And it's because she did this day after day, week after week, because of all the otheropportunities and breaks that I got along the way, all the sacrifices that my grandmother andmy grandfather made along the way, that I can stand here today as President of the UnitedStates. It's because of the sacrifices -- See, I want every child in this country to have thesame chance that my mother gave me, that my teachers gave me, that my college professorsgave me, that America gave me.You know these stories; you've lived them, as well. All of you have a similar story to tell. Youknow, it's -- I want children like Yvonne Bojorquez to have that chance. Yvonne is a student atVillage Academy High School in California. Now, Village Academy is a 21st century schoolwhere cutting edge technologies are used in the classroom, where college prep and careertraining are offered to all who seek it, and where the motto is ""respect, responsibility, andresults.""Now, a couple of months ago, Yvonne and her class made a video talking about the impactthat our struggling economy was having on their lives. And some of them spoke about theirparents being laid off, or their homes facing foreclosure, or their inability to focus on schoolwith everything that was happening at home. And when it was her turn to speak, Yvonnesaid: ""We've all been affected by this economic crisis. [We] are all college bound students;we're all businessmen, and doctors and lawyers and all this great stuff. And we have all thispotential -- but the way things are going, we're not going to be able to [fulfill it].""It was heartbreaking that a girl so full of promise was so full of worry that she and her classtitled their video, ""Is anybody listening?"" So, today, there's something I want to say toYvonne and her class at Village Academy: I am listening. We are listening. America islistening. And we will not rest until your parents can keep your jobs -- we will not rest untilyour parents can keep their jobs and your families can keep their homes, and you can focuson what you should be focusing on -- your own education; until you can become thebusinessmen, doctors, and lawyers of tomorrow, until you can reach out and grasp yourdreams for the future.For in the end, Yvonne's dream is a dream shared by all Americans. It's the founding promiseof our nation: That we can make of our lives what we will; that all things are possible for allpeople; and that here in America, our best days lie ahead. I believe that. I truly believe if I domy part, and you, the American people, do yours, then we will emerge from this crisis astronger nation, and pass the dream of our founding on to posterity, ever safer than before.Thank you very much. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Thank you.",obama
"Earlier today, we finished a very productive summit that will be, I believe, a turning point in our pursuit ofglobal economic recovery. By any measure, the London summit was historic.  It was historic because of the size and the scope of thechallenges that we face, and because of the timeliness and magnitude of our response. The challenge is clear.  The global economy is contracting. Trade is shrinking.  Unemployment is rising. The international finance system is nearly frozen.  Even these facts can't fully capture the crisis that we'reconfronting, because behind them is the pain and uncertainty that so many people are facing.  We see itback in the United States.  We see it here in London.  We see it around the world:  families losing theirhomes, workers losing their jobs and their savings, students who are deferring their dreams.  So many havelost so much.  Just to underscore this point, back in the United States, jobless claims released today werethe highest in 26 years.  We owe it to all of our citizens to act, and to act with a sense of urgency.In an age where our economies are linked more closely than ever before, the whole world has been touchedby this devastating downturn.  And today, the world's leaders have responded with an unprecedented set ofcomprehensive and coordinated actions.Now, just keep in mind some historical context.  Faced with similar global challenges in the past, the worldwas slow to act, and people paid an enormous price.  That was true in the Great Depression, when nationsprolonged and worsened the crisis by turning inward, waiting for more than a decade to meet the challengetogether.  Even as recently as the 1980s, the slow global response deepened and widened a debt crisis inLatin America that pushed millions into poverty.Today, we've learned the lessons of history.  I know that in the days leading up to the summit, some of youin the press, some commentators, confused honest and open debate with irreconcilable differences.  Butafter weeks of preparation, and two days of careful negotiation, we have agreed on a series ofunprecedented steps to restore growth and prevent a crisis like this from happening again.Let me outline what I think has been most significant.Number one, we are committed to growth and job creation.  All G20 nations have acted to stimulatedemand, which will total well over $2 trillion in global fiscal expansion.  The United States is also partneringwith the private sector to clean out the troubled assets, the legacy assets that are crippling some banks, andusing the full force of the government to ensure that our action leads directly to loans to businesses largeand small, as well as individuals who depend on credit.  And these efforts will be amplified by our G20partners, who are pursuing similarly comprehensive programs.And we also agreed on bold action to support developing countries, so that we aren't faced with decliningmarkets that the global economy depends on.  Together, the G20 is tripling the IMF's lending capacity andpromoting lending by multilateral development banks to increase the purchasing power and expand marketsin every country.We've also rejected the protectionism that could deepen this crisis.  History tells us that turning inward canhelp turn a downturn into a depression.  And this cooperation between the world's leading economiessignals our support for open markets, as does our multilateral commitment to trade finance that will grow ourexports and create new jobs.That's all on the growth front.And next we made enormous strides in committing ourselves to comprehensive reform of a failed regulatorysystem.  And together, I believe that we must put an end to the bubble-and-bust economy that has stood inthe way of sustained growth and enabled abusive risk-taking that endangers our prosperity.At home, back in the States, our efforts began with the approach that Secretary Geithner proposed lastweek, the strongest regulatory reforms any nation has contemplated so far to prevent the massive failure ofresponsibility that we have already seen.  Today, these principles have informed and enabled thecoordinated action that we will take with our G20 partners. To prevent future crises, we agreed to increased transparency and capital protections for financialinstitutions. We're extending supervision to all systemically important institutions, markets and products,including hedge funds.  We'll identify jurisdictions that fail to cooperate, including tax havens, and takeaction to defend our financial system.  We will reestablish the Financial Stability Forum with a strongermandate.  And we will reform and expand the IMF and World Bank so they are more efficient, effective andrepresentative.Finally, we are protecting those who don't always have a voice at the G20, but who have suffered greatly inthis crisis.  And the United States is ready to lead in this endeavor.  In the coming days, I intend to work withCongress to provide $448 million in immediate assistance to vulnerable populations -- from Africa to LatinAmerica -- and to double support for food safety to over $1 billion so that we are giving people the tools theyneed to lift themselves out of poverty.  We will also support the United Nations and World Bank as theycoordinate the rapid assistance necessary to prevent humanitarian catastrophe.I have to say, though, that this is not just charity.  These are all future markets for all countries, and futuredrivers of world economic growth.Let me also underscore my appreciation to Prime Minister Brown, his entire team, and all my colleaguesfrom around the world who contributed to the summit's success.  You know, it's hard for 20 heads of state tobridge their differences.  We've all got our own national policies; we all have our own assumptions, our ownpolitical cultures.  But our citizens are all hurting.  They all need us to come together.  So I'm pleased thatthe G20 has agreed to meet again this fall, because I believe that this is just the beginning.  Our problemsare not going to be solved in one meeting; they're not going to be solved in two meetings.  We're going tohave to be proactive in shaping events and persistent in monitoring our progress to determine whetherfurther action is needed.I also want to just make a few remarks about additional meetings I had outside of the G20 context.  Whilehere in London I had the opportunity to hold bilateral meetings with leaders of Russia, China, South Korea,Saudi Arabia and India, as well as Great Britain.  And these discussions were extraordinarily valuable andproductive.  Of course, we spoke about additional steps to promote economic recovery and growth.  But wealso discussed coordinated actions on a range of issues:  how we could reduce the nuclear threat; how wecould forge a coordinated response to North Korea's planned missile launch; how we can turn backterrorism and stabilize Afghanistan; how we can protect our planet from the scourge of climate change.  I'mencouraged that we laid the groundwork for real and lasting progress on a host of these issues. Ultimately, the challenges of the 21st century can't be met without collective action.  Agreement will almostnever be easy, and results won't always come quickly.  But I am committed to respecting different points ofview, and to forging a consensus instead of dictating our terms.  That's how we made progress in the lastfew days.  And that's how we will advance and uphold our ideals in the months and years to come.You know, at home, I've often spoken about a new era of responsibility.  And I believe strongly that this eramust not end at our borders.  In a world that's more and more interconnected, we all have responsibilities towork together to solve common challenges.  And although it will take time, I am confident that we will rebuildglobal prosperity if we act with a common sense of purpose, persistence, and the optimism that the momentdemands.So I appreciate your attention, and I'm going to take a few questions.  I've got a list of a few people I'm goingto call on and then I will intersperse some folks I'm calling on randomly.Helene Cooper.Q    Mr. President, --PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Well, I think we did okay.  You know, when I came here, it was with the intention oflistening and learning, but also providing American leadership.  And I think that the document that has beenproduced as well as the concrete actions that will follow reflect a range of our priorities.   We wanted to make sure that we had a strong, coordinated response to growth -- and that's reflected in thedocument and in the actions that will be taken.  We thought it was important to make sure that we had astrong, coordinated regulatory response  -- and many of the details of the regulatory response draw fromprinciples that we had developed prior to coming here.  We felt that it was very important to strengthen our international financial institutions because developingcountries, emerging markets are threatened -- even though they may not have been the cause of this crisis -- they are threatened by capital flight; they're threatened by reduced trade finance; drops in consumerdemand in developed countries that were their export markets, and so we knew that it was going to beimportant to provide those countries with assistance.  And we have created as fundamental a reworking ofthe resources available to these international financial institutions as anything we've done in the last severaldecades.So, overall, I'm pleased with the product.  And I'll leave it to others to determine whether me and my teamhad anything to do with that.  All right?Chuck Todd.  Chuck.Q    What concrete items that you got out of this G20 can you tell the American people back home who arehurting, the family struggling, seeing their retirement go down, or worrying about losing their job -- whathappened here today that helps that family back home in the heartland?PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Well, as I said before, we've got a global economy, and if we're taking actions inisolation in the United States, but those actions are contradicted overseas, then we're only going to behalfway effective -- maybe not even half.  You've seen, for example, a drastic decline in U.S. exports over the last several months.  You look at acompany like Caterpillar, in my home state of Illinois, which up until last year was doing extraordinarily well;in fact, export growth was what had sustained it even after the recession had begun.  As a consequence ofthe world recession, as a consequence of the contagion from the financial markets debilitating theeconomies elsewhere, Caterpillar is now in very bad shape.  So if we want to get Caterpillar back on its feet,if we want to get all those export companies back on their feet, so that they are hiring, putting people back towork, putting money in people's pockets, we've got to make sure that the global economy as a whole issuccessful.  And this document, which affirms the need for all countries to take fiscal responses that increase demand,that encourages the openness of markets, those are all going to be helpful in us being able to fix what ailsthe economy back home.Let me mix in a -- Justin Webb, BBC.  Where's Justin?  There he is.  Go ahead.Q    Mr. President, in the spirit of openness, with which you say you're -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Why don't you get a microphone?  See, everybody is complaining.  I'm sure that's allyour fellow British journalists.Q    They're extraordinarily well behaved, Mr. President.  In the spirit of openness, with which you say you'regoing to run your administration, could you give us an insight into an area or areas where you came toLondon wanting something and you didn't get it; where you compromised, where you gave something awayto achieve the wider breakthrough agreement?PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Well, I think that if you look at the language of the document, there are probablysome areas where it wasn't so much of a sacrifice as it might not have been our number-one priority, but itbecame clear that it was very important to certain other actors. I'd rather not specify what those precise items would be, because this is a collective document.  But there'sno doubt that each country has its own quirks and own particular issues that a leader may decide is really,really important; something that is non-negotiable for them.  And what we tried to do as much as possiblewas to accommodate those issues in a way that didn't -- did not hamper the effectiveness of the overalldocument to address what I think are the core issues related to this crisis.Now, keep in mind -- I think that this kind of coordination really is historic.  I said in the meeting that if youhad imagined 10 years ago, or 20 years ago, or 30 years ago, that you'd have the leaders of Germany,France, China, Russia, Brazil, South Africa, a President of the United States named Obama -- formeradversaries, in some cases former mortal enemies, negotiating this swiftly on behalf of fixing the globaleconomy, you would have said, that's crazy.  And yet it was happening, and it happened with relatively little-- relatively few hiccups.  And I think that's a testimony to the great work that Gordon Brown did, and histeam, in organizing the summit, the collective work in our teams in doing some good preparation, somegood ground work.  So I'm very proud of what's been done.  This alone is not enough.  And obviously the actions that each of us take in our individual countries are stillabsolutely vital.  So we have a set of principles, for example, around dealing with systemic risk that I thinkwill be very important in preventing the kinds of financial crises that we've seen.  That does not entirely solve the problem of toxic assets that are still in U.S. banks and certain British banksand certain European banks.  And how each individual nation acts to deal with that is still going to be vitallyimportant.  How well we execute the respective stimulus programs around the world is going to be veryimportant.  The quicker they are, the more effective they are at actually boosting demand, the more all of uswill benefit.  The more encumbered they are by bureaucracy and mismanagement and corruption, that willhamper our development efforts as a whole.So this is not a panacea, but it is a critical step, and I think it lays the foundation so that, should the actionsthat we've taken individually and collectively so far not succeed in boosting global demand and growth,should you continue to see a freezing of credit or a hemorrhaging of jobs around the world, I think we'vecreated a good foundation for this leadership to come back together again and take additional steps until weget it right.Okay, Michael Shear.  Where's Michael?Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  I wonder if you view this trip that you're on and the actions that you've takenhere at the G20 and with the bilateral meetings that you've had as representing a break from the foreignpolicy of your predecessor. And if so, could you describe where you see and how you see the principles thatguide a different view of the world?PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Well, you know, I didn't accompany President Bush on his various summits, so Idon't know how he was operating.  And I won't -- I won't warrant a guess on that.I can tell you that what I've tried to do since I started running for President and since I was sworn in asPresident, is to communicate the notion that America is a critical actor and leader on the world stage, andthat we shouldn't be embarrassed about that, but that we exercise our leadership best when we arelistening; when we recognize that the world is a complicated place and that we are going to have to act inpartnership with other countries; when we lead by example; when we show some element of humility andrecognize that we may not always have the best answer, but we can always encourage the best answer andsupport the best answer. So I think that's the -- that's the approach that we've tried to take in our foreign policy since myadministration came in.  Now, we come in at extraordinarily challenging times, and yet I actually think thatthat calls for this type of leadership even more.  But, ultimately, we won't know how effective we are until welook back a year from now, or two years from now, or three years from now and see if it worked.  And what the American people care about I suspect are the same thing that the British people care about,and that is, are you putting people back to work?  Are businesses growing again?  Is business -- is creditflowing again?  And, you know -- and that's just true with respect to this summit.  But when it comes to ourAfghanistan policy, the question is going to be, have we made ourselves safer; have we reduced the risksand incidents of terrorism? And so the proof of the pudding is in the eating.  But hopefully, I think at least we've set a toneinternationally where people don't -- where they give us the benefit of the doubt.  They're still going to havetheir interests, and we're going to have ours.  There are going to be tough negotiations, and sometimeswe're going to have to walk away from those negotiations if we can't arrive at a common accord.  There aregoing to be real dangers that can't always be talked through and have to be addressed.  But at least we canstart with the notion that we're prepared to listen and to work cooperatively with countries around the world.All right, let me sprinkle in another -- it's got to be an international person.  All right, this young lady rightthere.  Mr. President, Emma Alberici from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.  At the moment, in theU.S., the U.K., and in Australia, executive salaries and bonuses are decided in the boardrooms of majorpublicly listed companies.  Who will be making those decisions on salaries and bonuses as a result of theagreement you've made here today?  And if it is still the boards, will they be guided by principles orlegislation?PRESIDENT OBAMA:  The principles that we outlined I think put in place or move us in the direction of whatI consider to be best practices, which is that there is some accountability with respect to executivecompensation.Now, theoretically, that should be the shareholders.  But the way that too many corporations have operatedfor too long is that you have a CEO who basically selects his board; the board, in a fairly cozy relationshipoftentimes with the executive, hires a executive compensation firm, which, surprisingly, tends to think thatit's necessary to retain the best talent to pay people $20 or $30 million a year; and we get into the kinds ofhabits and practices that I think have not been -- have not served shareholders well, I think ultimately distortthe decision-making of many CEOs.When I was in the United States Senate, I actually worked on a piece of legislation that would -- made thesimple proposition that executive compensation should be subject to a shareholder vote, even if it wasnonbinding, so that there was transparency and accountability and perhaps a shame function that wouldtake place.  And that principle, I think, is reflected in these guidelines.What it says is, is that if you get shareholders involved and those shareholders are given a set of principlesand best practices by which they can judge executive compensation, then you can still have outsizedrewards and success for successful business people, but it will be based on not short-term performance, notthree-month performance, not your ability to flip quick profits off products like derivatives that don't turn outto be particularly productive to the company, but based on sustained, effective growth.  And that's what'sembodied in these documents, and I think that you're going to see a lot of countries try to encourage thatkind of transparency and accountability. It doesn't mean the state micromanaging -- [sneezes] -- excuse me -- I've been fighting this all week -- itdoesn't mean that we want the state dictating salaries; we don't.  We -- I strongly believe in a free-marketsystem, and as I -- as I think people understand in America, at least, people don't resent the rich; they wantto be rich.  And that's good.  But we want to make sure that there's mechanisms in place that holds peopleaccountable and produces results.  Okay?Got to go back to my crew.  Jake Tapper.Thank you, Mr. President.  Two questions.  One, can you say with confidence that the steps the G20nations are taking today -- committing to today will help the world, or will prevent the world to avoid adepression or a deeper recession?And two, your friend and ally, Prime Minister Brown, said that ""The old Washington consensus is over; todaywe have reached a new consensus.""  Is he right?  And what do you think he meant by that?PRESIDENT OBAMA:  In life there are no guarantees; in economics there are no guarantees.  The peoplewho thought they could provide guarantees, many of them worked at AIG and it didn't work out so well.  Sothere are always risks involved.I have no doubt, though, that the steps that have been taken are critical to preventing us sliding into adepression.  They are bolder and more rapid than any international response that we've seen to a financialcrisis in memory.  And I think that they will have a concrete effect in our ability, individually, in each nation,to create jobs, save jobs that exist, grow the economy, loosen up credit, restore trust and confidence in thefinancial markets.So these steps -- another way of putting it is I think the steps in the communiqu were necessary.  Whetherthey're sufficient, we've got to -- we've got to wait and see.  I'm actually confident, though, that given thecommon commitment in the United States and in the other G20 countries to act rapidly and boldly, that if wesee other inklings of panic in the marketplace, or things unwinding, that this group, once again, will respondas needed.So I guess maybe just to use an analogy that was used several times in this meeting, an analogy that I'veused in the past:  You got a sick patient; I think we applied the right medicine; I think the patient is stabilized;there's still wounds that have to heal and there's still emergencies that could arise, but I think that you've gotsome pretty good care being applied. You had a second, follow-up question?Prime Minister Brown saying -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Oh, the Washington consensus.  Well, the Washington consensus, as I'm sureyou're aware, Jake, is sort of a term of art about a certain set of policies surrounding globalization and theapplication of a cookie-cutter model to economic growth, trade liberalization, deregulation that was popularand did help globalize and grow the economy, and was led by some of our leading economists andpolicymakers in Washington.  I think that there's always been a spectrum of opinion about how unfettered the free market is.  And alongthat spectrum, I think there have been some who believe in very fierce regulation and are very suspicious ofglobalization, and there are others who think that it's always -- that the market is always king.  And I thinkwhat we've learned here, but if anybody had been studying history they would have understood earlier, isthat the market is the most effective mechanism for creating wealth and distributing resources to producegoods and services that history has ever known, but that it goes off the rail sometimes; that if it's completelyunregulated, that if there are no thoughtful frameworks to channel the creative energy of the market, that itcan end up in a very bad place.And so, in that sense, I think that we just went through a couple of decades where there was an artificialcomplacency about the dangers of markets going off the rails.  And a crisis like this reminds us that we justhave to put in some common-sense rules of the road, without throwing out the enormous benefits thatglobalization have brought in terms of improving living standards, reducing the cost of goods, and bringingthe world closer together.All right, I've got time for just a couple more questions.  I'm going to find a journalist here --How about me?PRESIDENT OBAMA:  All right, I'm going to call on this gentleman right here.  He's been very persistent.Excuse me.  China Central Television.  Since the world leaders have been talking about increasing thevoice and voting rights of developing countries, I would like to ask two questions instead of just one.  First ofall, on behalf of China --PRESIDENT OBAMA:  I may choose which one I want to answer. Of course.  PRESIDENT OBAMA:  That's always the danger of asking two questions.First of all, you've had a very fruitful meeting with our President.  And during the Clinton administration,U.S.-China relationship were characterized, in Clinton's words, ""strategic, constructive partnership.""  Duringthe Bush era, it was -- the catchphrase was ""stakeholder.""  The Bush administration expects China tobecome a responsible stakeholder in international affairs.  Have you come up with a catchphrase of yourown?  And certainly it is not the G2, is it?My second question is, on behalf of the world, politics is very local, even though we've been talking aboutglobal solution, as indicated by your recent preference over American journalists and British -- which isokay.  How can you make sure that you will do whatever you can so that -- that local politics will not trump ornegatively affect good international economics? Thank you, Mr. President.PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Well, those are excellent questions.  On the first question, your Americancounterparts will tell you I'm terrible with those little catchphrases and sound bites.  So I haven't come upwith anything catchy yet, but if you have any suggestions, let me know.  I'll be happy to use them.In terms of local politics, look, I'm the President of the United States.  I'm not the President of China, I'm notthe President of Japan, I'm not the President of the other participants here.  And so I have a directresponsibility to my constituents to make their lives better.  That's why they put me in there.  That accountsfor some of the questions here, about how concretely does me being here help them find a job, pay for theirhome, send their kids to college, live what we call the American Dream.  And I will be judged by myeffectiveness in meeting their needs and concerns.   But in an era of integration and interdependence, it is also my responsibility to lead America into recognizingthat its interests, its fate is tied up with the larger world; that if we neglect or abandon those who aresuffering in poverty, that not only are we depriving ourselves of potential opportunities for markets andeconomic growth, but ultimately that despair may turn to violence that turns on us; that unless we areconcerned about the education of all children and not just our children, not only may we be deprivingourselves of the next great scientist who's going to find the next new energy source that saves the planet,but we also may make people around the world much more vulnerable to anti-American propaganda.So if I'm effective as America's President right now, part of that effectiveness involves holding a -- providingAmericans insight into how their self-interest is tied up with yours.  And that's an ongoing project becauseit's not always obvious.  And there are going to be times where short-term interests are going to differ; there's no doubt about it.  Andprotectionism is the classic example.  You can make arguments that if you can get away with protectingyour markets, as long as the other folks don't protect theirs, then in the short term you may benefit.  And itthen becomes important not only for me to try to give people a sense of why, over the long term, that'scounterproductive, but also it becomes important for me to put policies in place in the United States thatprovide a cushion, provide support for those people who may suffer local dislocations because ofglobalization.  And that's something that I think every government has to think about.            There are individuals who will be harmed by a trade deal.  There are businesses who will go out of businessbecause of free trade.  And to the extent that a government is not there to help them reshape their companyor retrain for the new jobs that are being created, over time you're going to get people who see -- who rightlysee their personal self-interest in very narrow terms.  Okay?Two more questions.  Jonathan Weisman. Thank you, Mr. President.  During the campaign you often spoke of a diminished power and authority ofthe United States over the last decade.  This is your first time in an international summit like this, and I'mwondering what evidence you saw of what you spoke of during the campaign.  And specifically, is thedeclaration of the end of the Washington consensus evidence of the diminished authority that you fearedwas out there?PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Well, first of all, during the campaign I did not say that some of that loss of authoritywas inevitable.  I said it was traced to very specific decisions that the previous administration had made thatI believed had lowered our standing in the world.  And that wasn't simply my opinion; that was, it turns out,the opinion of many people around the world.  I would like to think that with my election and the early decisions that we've made, that you're starting to seesome restoration of America's standing in the world.  And although, as you know, I always mistrust polls,international polls seem to indicate that you're seeing people more hopeful about America's leadership.Now, we remain the largest economy in the world by a pretty significant margin.  We remain the mostpowerful military on Earth.  Our production of culture, our politics, our media still have -- I didn't mean to saythat with such scorn, guys -- you know I'm teasing -- still has enormous influence.  And so I do not buy intothe notion that America can't lead in the world.  I wouldn't be here if I didn't think that we had importantthings to contribute.  I just think in a world that is as complex as it is, that it is very important for us to be able to forgepartnerships as opposed to simply dictating solutions.  Just a -- just to try to crystallize the example, there'sbeen a lot of comparison here about Bretton Woods.  ""Oh, well, last time you saw the entire internationalarchitecture being remade.""Well, if there's just Roosevelt and Churchill sitting in a room with a brandy, that's a -- that's an easiernegotiation.  But that's not the world we live in, and it shouldn't be the world that we live in.And so that's not a loss for America; it's an appreciation that Europe is now rebuilt and a powerhouse. Japan is rebuilt, is a powerhouse.  China, India -- these are all countries on the move.  And that's good. That means there are millions of people -- billions of people -- who are working their way out of poverty. And over time, that potentially makes this a much more peaceful world.   And that's the kind of leadership we need to show -- one that helps guide that process of orderly integrationwithout taking our eyes off the fact that it's only as good as the benefits of individual families, individualchildren:  Is it giving them more opportunity; is it giving them a better life?  If we judge ourselves by thosestandards, then I think America can continue to show leadership for a very long time.I'm going to call one foreigner -- actually, I'm the foreigner.  That's why I smiled.  One correspondent notfrom America.  And then I will -- [vociferous commotion] -- we're not doing bidding here.  But I also want tomake sure that I'm not showing gender bias.  So this young lady right here -- not you, sir, I'm sorry. Q    Hi, Mr. President. PRESIDENT OBAMA:  How are you?Thank you for choosing me.  I'm very well.  I'm from the Times of India.PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Wonderful.You met with our Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh.  What did you -- what is America doing to help Indiatackle terrorism emanating from Pakistan?PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Well, first of all, your Prime Minister is a wonderful man. Thank you.  I agree.PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Well -- I agree.  PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Did you have something to do with that, or -- You seem to kind of take -- take creditfor it a little bit there.  Q    Really proud of him, sir.PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Of course.  You should be proud of him.  I'm teasing you.I think he's a very wise and decent man, and has done a wonderful job in guiding India, even prior to beingPrime Minister, along a path of extraordinary economic growth that is a marvel, I think, for all the world.We did discuss the issue of terrorism.  And we discussed it not simply in terms of terrorism emanating fromPakistan, although obviously we are very concerned about extremists and terrorists who have made campin the border regions of Pakistan as well as in Afghanistan.  But we spoke about it more broadly in terms ofhow we can coordinate effectively on issues of counterterrorism.  We also spoke about the fact that in a nuclear age, at a time when perhaps the greatest enemy of both Indiaand Pakistan should be poverty, that it may make sense to create a more effective dialogue between Indiaand Pakistan.  But obviously we didn't go in depth into those issues.  We talked about a whole range of other issues related to, for example, energy, and how important it is forthe United States to lead by example in reducing our carbon footprint so that we can help to forgeagreements with countries like China and India that, on a per-capita basis, have a much smaller footprintand so justifiably chafe at the idea that they should have to sacrifice their development for our efforts tocontrol climate change; but also acknowledging that if China and India, with their populations, had the sameenergy usage as the average American, then we would have all melted by now.And so that was a very interesting conversation that I will be pursuing not just with India, but hopefully withChina and with other countries around the world.  In some ways our European counterparts have movedmore quickly than we have on this issue. But I think even the Europeans have recognized that it's not easy. It's even harder during times of economic downturn.And so we're going to have to combine the low-hanging fruit of energy efficiency with rapid technologicaladvances.  And to the extent that in some cases we can get international cooperation and pool our scientificand technical knowledge around things like developing coal sequestration, for example, that can beextremely helpful.  Okay?I'm going to call on my last American correspondent, Chip.  And, Chip, my heart goes out to you. Q    Thank you.  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  I appreciate that.PRESIDENT OBAMA:  I just heard about that.Q    Certainly there is a lot of sentiment in G20 countries that the United States was a major cause of theglobal economic meltdown.  To what degree did that topic come up in your discussions?  Did it make itdifficult for some countries to accept advice from the United States when they blame the United States andits economic system for causing this in the first place?  And how do you respond to people who do blameAmerica?PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Well, you know, I don't think that -- I think my colleagues in the G20 wereextraordinarily gracious about my participation.I think that they continue to express the desire to work with America, admiration about many thingsAmerican.  There were occasional comments, usually wedged into some other topic, that indicated fromtheir perspective that this started in America, or this started on Wall Street, or this started with particularbanks or companies.Perhaps what helped was my willingness to acknowledge that  -- and it's hard to deny -- that some of thiscontagion did start on Wall Street.  And as I've said back home, as I've said in public and as I would say inprivate, we had a number of firms that took wild and unjustified risks, we had regulators that were asleep atthe switch, and it has taken an enormous toll on the U.S. economy and has spread to the world economy.Now, I think that part of the reason people didn't give me too hard a time is because if you look at Europeanbanks or Asian banks, that they've had their own issues both in the past and in the future.  And I think therewas a very constructive discussion about the fact that, given global financial flows, that unless we've gotmuch more effective coordinated regulatory strategies, supervision, standards, that these problems willappear again.Money is -- can move around the globe in a second.  And it will seek out the highest returns, and if thosehighest returns end up being built on a house of cards, then we're going to be seeing another threat to theworld financial system wherever that house of cards might be. And so, overall, I think there was an extraordinarily constructive approach among all the leaders.  I was veryimpressed with them.  I'm very grateful to them.  And I'm excited about the ability not just to help heal thiseconomy but also to make progress on a sustainable model of economic growth that relies less on a cycleof bubble and bust -- something that I've spoken about back home.All right?  Thank you, everybody.  Appreciate it.",obama
"Thank you so much. Good afternoon. Bon aprs-midi. And guten tag. It is a great honor for me to be here inEurope, to be here in Strasbourg. I want to make just a few acknowledgements. I want to thank thePresident of France, Nicolas Sarkozy, for being such a terrific friend. I want to thank his wife, MadamSarkozy. They just hosted us at the palace and could not have been more gracious.I want to thank the Charge d'Affaires, Mark Pekala, and his wife, Maria, who were helping to organize us;Vincent Carver, who's the Counsel General in Strasbourg. And I want to thank the Mayor of Strasbourg,Roland Ries, for his hospitality.It is wonderful to be here with all of you and to have an opportunity not only to speak to you but also to takesome questions. You know, oftentimes during these foreign trips you see everything from behind a window,and what we thought was important was for me to have an opportunity to not only speak with you but also tohear from you, because that's ultimately how we can learn about each other. But before I take somequestions, I hope you don't mind me making a few remarks about my country and yours; the relationshipbetween the United States and the relationship between Europe.Strasbourg has been known throughout history as a city at the crossroads. Over thousands of years, youstraddled many kingdoms and many cultures. Two rivers are joined here. Two religions have flourished inyour churches. Three languages comprise an ancient oath that bears the city's name. You served as acenter of industry and commerce, a seat of government and education, where Goethe studied and Pasteurtaught and Gutenberg imagined his printing press.So it's fitting because we find ourselves at a crossroads as well -- all of us -- for we've arrived at a momentwhere each nation and every citizen must choose at last how we respond to a world that has grown smallerand more connected than at any time in its existence.We've known for a long time that the revolutions in communications and technology that took place in the20th century would hold out enormous promise for the 21st century -- the promise of broader prosperity andmobility; of new breakthroughs and discoveries that could help us lead richer and fuller lives. But the sameforces that have brought us closer together have also given rise to new dangers that threaten to tear ourworld apart -- dangers that cannot be contained by the nearest border or the furthest ocean.Even with the Cold War now over, the spread of nuclear weapons or the theft of nuclear material could leadto the extermination of any city on the planet. And this weekend in Prague, I will lay out an agenda to seekthe goal of a world without nuclear weapons.We also know that the pollution from cars in Boston or from factories in Beijing are melting the ice caps inthe Arctic, and that that will disrupt weather patterns everywhere. The terrorists who struck in London, inNew York, plotted in distant caves and simple apartments much closer to your home. And the recklessspeculation of bankers that has new fueled a global economic downturn that's inflicting pain on workers andfamilies is happening everywhere all across the globe.The economic crisis has proven the fact of our interdependence in the most visible way yet. Not more than ageneration ago, it would have been difficult to imagine that the inability of somebody to pay for a house inFlorida could contribute to the failure of the banking system in Iceland. Today what's difficult to imagine isthat we did not act sooner to shape our future.Now, there's plenty of blame to go around for what has happened, and the United States certainly shares its-- shares blame for what has happened. But every nation bears responsibility for what lies ahead, especiallynow, for whether it's the recession or climate change, or terrorism, or drug trafficking, poverty, or theproliferation of nuclear weapons, we have learned that without a doubt there's no quarter of the globe thatcan wall itself off from the threats of the 21st century.The one way forward -- the only way forward -- is through a common and persistent effort to combat fearand want wherever they exist. That is the challenge of our time -- and we can not fail to meet it, together.Now, we take for granted the peace of a Europe that's united, but for centuries Strasbourg has beenattacked and occupied and claimed by the warring nations of this continent. Now, today in this city, thepresence of the European Parliament and the Council of Europe stand as symbols of a Europe that is unitedpeaceful and free.Now, we take this peace and prosperity for granted, but this destination was not easily reached, nor was itpredestined. The buildings that are now living monuments to European unity were not drawn from simpleblueprints. They were born out of the blood of the first half of the 20th century and the resolve of the second.Men and women had to have the imagination to see a better future, and the courage to reach for it.Europeans and Americans had to have the sense of common purpose to join one another, and the patienceand the persistence to see a long twilight struggle through.It was 61 years ago this April that a Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe helped to deliver hope to a continentthat had been decimated by war. Amid the ashes and the rubble that surrounded so many cities like thisone, America joined with you in an unprecedented effort that secured a lasting prosperity not just in Europe,but around the world -- on both sides of the Atlantic.One year later, exactly 60 years ago tomorrow, we ensured our shared security when 12 of our nationssigned a treaty in Washington that spelled out a simple agreement: An attack on one would be viewed as anattack on all. Without firing a single shot, this Alliance would prevent the Iron Curtain from descending onthe free nations of Western Europe. It would lead eventually to the crumbling of a wall in Berlin and the endof the Communist threat. Two decades later, with 28 member nations that stretched from the Baltic to theMediterranean, NATO remains the strongest alliance that the world has ever known.At the crossroads where we stand today, this shared history gives us hope -- but it must not give us rest.This generation cannot stand still. We cannot be content merely to celebrate the achievements of the 20thcentury, or enjoy the comforts of the 21st century; we must learn from the past to build on its success. Wemust renew our institutions, our alliances. We must seek the solutions to the challenges of this youngcentury.This is our generation. This is our time. And I am confident that we can meet any challenge as long as weare together.Such an effort is never easy. It's always harder to forge true partnerships and sturdy alliances than to actalone, or to wait for the action of somebody else. It's more difficult to break down walls of division than tosimply allow our differences to build and our resentments to fester. So we must be honest with ourselves. Inrecent years we've allowed our Alliance to drift. I know that there have been honest disagreements overpolicy, but we also know that there's something more that has crept into our relationship. In America, there'sa failure to appreciate Europe's leading role in the world. Instead of celebrating your dynamic union andseeking to partner with you to meet common challenges, there have been times where America has shownarrogance and been dismissive, even derisive.But in Europe, there is an anti-Americanism that is at once casual but can also be insidious. Instead ofrecognizing the good that America so often does in the world, there have been times where Europeanschoose to blame America for much of what's bad.On both sides of the Atlantic, these attitudes have become all too common. They are not wise. They do notrepresent the truth. They threaten to widen the divide across the Atlantic and leave us both more isolated.They fail to acknowledge the fundamental truth that America cannot confront the challenges of this centuryalone, but that Europe cannot confront them without America.So I've come to Europe this week to renew our partnership, one in which America listens and learns fromour friends and allies, but where our friends and allies bear their share of the burden. Together, we mustforge common solutions to our common problems.So let me say this as clearly as I can: America is changing, but it cannot be America alone that changes. Weare confronting the greatest economic crisis since World War II. The only way to confront thisunprecedented crisis is through unprecedented coordination.Over the last few days, I believe that we have begun that effort. The G20 summit in London was a successof nations coming together, working out their differences, and moving boldly forward. All of us are movingaggressively to restore growth and lending. All of us have agreed to the most substantial overhaul of ourinternational financial system in a generation. No one is exempt. No more will the world's financial playersbe able to make risky bets at the expense of ordinary people. Those days are over. We are ushering a newera of responsibility, and that is something we should all be proud of.As we take these steps, we also affirm that we must not erect new barriers to commerce; that trade warshave no victors. We can't give up on open markets, even as we work to ensure that trade is both free andfair. We cannot forget how many millions that trade has lifted out of poverty and into the middle class. Wecan't forget that part of the freedom that our nations stood for throughout the Cold War was the opportunitythat comes from free enterprise and individual liberty.I know it can be tempting to turn inward, and I understand how many people and nations have been leftbehind by the global economy. And that's why the United States is leading an effort to reach out to peoplearound the world who are suffering, to provide them immediate assistance and to extend support for foodsecurity that will help them lift themselves out of poverty.All of us must join together in this effort, not just because it is right, but because by providing assistance tothose countries most in need, we will provide new markets, we will drive the growth of the future that lifts allof us up. So it's not just charity; it's a matter of understanding that our fates are tied together -- not just thefate of Europe and America, but the fate of the entire world.And as we restore our common prosperity, we must stand up for our common security. As we meet heretoday, NATO has still embarked on its first mission overseas in Afghanistan, and my administration has justcompleted a review of our policy in that region.Now, I understand that this war has been long. Our allies have already contributed greatly to this endeavor.You've sent your sons and daughters to fight alongside ours, and we honor and respect their service andsacrifice.And I also know that there's some who have asked questions about why are we still in Afghanistan? Whatdoes this mean? What's its purpose? Understand we would not deploy our own troops if this mission wasnot indispensable to our common security. As President, I can tell you there's no decision more difficult,there's no duty more painful, than signing a letter to the family of somebody who has died in war.So I understand that there is doubt about this war in Europe. There's doubt at times even in the UnitedStates. But know this: The United States of America did not choose to fight a war in Afghanistan. We wereattacked by an al Qaeda network that killed thousands on American soil, including French and Germans.Along the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan, those terrorists are still plotting today. And they're -- if there isanother al Qaeda attack, it is just as likely, if not more, that it will be here in Europe in a European city.So I've made a commitment to Afghanistan, and I've asked our NATO partners for more civilian and militarysupport and assistance. We do this with a clear purpose: to root out the terrorists who threaten all of us, totrain the Afghan people to sustain their own security and to help them advance their own opportunity, and toquicken the day when our troops come home.We have no interest in occupying Afghanistan. We have more than enough to do in rebuilding America. Butthis is a mission that tests whether nations can come together in common purpose on behalf of our commonsecurity. That's what we did together in the 20th century. And now we need an alliance that is even strongerthan when it brought down a mighty wall in Berlin.That's why we applaud France's decision to expand and deepen its participation in NATO, just as wesupport a strong European defense. That's why we welcome Croatia and Albania into the fold. And that iswhy we must ensure that NATO is equipped and capable of facing down the threats and challenges of thisnew age. This is one of our central tasks.And we also know that in the 21st century, security is more complex than military power. This is thegeneration that must also stop the spread of the pollution that is slowly killing our planet, from shrinkingcoastlines and devastating storms to widespread misery and famine and drought. The effects of climatechange are now in plain sight.Europe has acted with a seriousness of purpose that this challenge demands. And in the last few monthsI'm proud to say that America has begun to take unprecedented steps to transform the way that we useenergy. We appointed a special envoy to help us lead a global effort to reduce the carbon that we send inthe atmosphere.But we all know that time is running out. And that means that America must do more. Europe must do more.China and India must do more. Rolling back the tide of a warming planet is a responsibility that we have toourselves, to our children, and all of those who will inherit God's creation long after we are gone. So let usmeet that responsibility together. I am confident that we can meet it. But we have to begin today.And let us resolve that when future generations look back on ours, they will be able to say that we did ourpart to make this world more peaceful.It's perhaps the most difficult work of all to resolve age-old conflicts, to heal ancient hatreds, to dissolve thelines of suspicion between religions and cultures, and people who may not look like us, or have the samefaith that we do, or come from the same place. But just because it's difficult does not make the work anyless important. It does not absolve us from trying.And to that end, America will sustain our effort to forge and secure a lasting peace between the Israelis andthe Palestinians. I've sent a clear message to the leaders and peoples of Iran that while we have realdifferences, we also have mutual interests, and we seek new engagement based on mutual respect. And itis in that spirit that America and Europe must reach out to the vast majority of Muslims in our nations and inall nations. We seek only hope of peace and partnership, and the opportunity of a better life.We cannot simply solve these conflicts militarily. We have to open our minds and we have to open ourhearts to the differences among us and the commonalities between us. With every threat that we face, anew day is possible. We can't get there alone. As it was in the darkest days after World War II, when acontinent lay in ruins and an atomic cloud had settled over the world, we must make the journey together.We know that transformational change is possible. We know this because of three reasons: First, because,for all our differences, there are certain values that bind us together and reveal our common humanity: theuniversal longing to live a life free from fear, and free from want; a life marked by dignity and respect andsimple justice.Our two republics were founded in service of these ideals. In America, it is written into our foundingdocuments as ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."" In France: ""Libert"" -- absolutely -- ""egalit,fraternit."" Our moral authority is derived from the fact that generations of our citizens have fought and bledto uphold these values in our nations and others.And that's why we can never sacrifice them for expedience's sake. That's why I've ordered the closing of thedetention center in Guantanamo Bay. That's why I can stand here today and say without equivocation orexception that the United States of America does not and will not torture.The second way that we can turn challenge into opportunity is through our persistence in the face ofdifficulty. In an age of instant gratification, it's tempting to believe that every problem can and should besolved in the span of a week. When these problems aren't solved, we conclude that our efforts to solvethem must have been in vain. But that's not how progress is made. Progress is slow. It comes in fits andstarts, because we try and we fail and then we try something else. And when there are setbacks anddisappointments we keep going. We hold firm to our core values, and we hold firm to our faith in oneanother.The third reason we know that we can change this world is because of men and women like the youngpeople who are here today. Each time we find ourselves at a crossroads, paralyzed by worn debates andstale thinking, the old ways of doing things, a new generation rises up and shows the way forward. AsRobert Kennedy once told a crowd of students in South Africa, ""It is a revolutionary world that we live in, andthus, it is young people who must take the lead."" Because young people are unburdened by the biases orprejudices of the past. That is a great privilege of youth. But it's also a tremendous responsibility because itis you who must ultimately decide what we do with this incredible moment in history.We just emerged from an era marked by irresponsibility, and it would be easy to choose the path ofselfishness or apathy, of blame or division. But that is a danger that we cannot afford. The challenges aretoo great. It is a revolutionary world that we live in, and history shows us that we can do improbable,sometimes impossible things. We stand here in a city that used to stand at the center of European conflict;only now it is the center of European union. We did that together. Now we must not give up on one another.We must renew this relationship for a new generation, in a new century. We must hold firm to our commonvalues, hold firm to our faith in one another. Together, I'm confident that we can achieve the promise of anew day.Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much.Please, everybody have a seat. So the way this works -- do we have microphones in the audience? Yes?So just raise your hand if you want a question, and I will call on you. I think we have some translators. If youwant to speak French and German, my French and German are terrible. But we have people who speakvery good French and very good German who will translate your question, and translate my answer. And Iwill try to get as many questions as I can get in, in the remaining 20 minutes or so that we have.And I will start with this young lady right here. Yes, you, right there. Please introduce yourself. Hold on, Ican't hear you yet. Can we increase the sound on the mic? Let's try again. Oh, I called -- now, I just want tosay I did not call on the American on purpose.Q [Inaudible.]PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, after only two months, that's kind of a big question. But here's what I would liketo see. And, look, you aim high knowing that you'll make mistakes and sometimes you'll fall short.Number one, my first task is to restore the economy of the United States, but, in concert with other nations,to restore global economic growth. That's my number one task, because we are going through the worstcrisis since the 1930s.That means that not only do we have to fix the banking system, put common-sense regulations in place toprevent a crisis like this from ever happening again, making sure that we are keeping trade relationshipsbetween countries open -- but it also means helping developing countries and poor countries who, throughno fault of their own, have been devastated by this crisis, and if we allow them to collapse will ultimately bea drag on our ability to prosper.Emerging markets have actually been the drivers of economic growth over the last several years. If we canget millions of Chinese to prosper, that is ultimately good for us. If we can get all the Indians in poverty tosuddenly be able to buy a refrigerator or send their children to college, that will raise everybody's livingstandards, because those will be enormous new markets for all of us.So what I want to be able to do is not only fix the immediate crisis, but, working in partnership with othercountries, create a path for sustainable, responsible growth. And I think we can do that. There are a lot ofpeople who benefit from globalization, but there are also people who have been harmed by globalization.Globalization in and of itself can be good, but can also be destructive.If we create the right framework so that what happened in the banking system can't happen again, thenglobalization can be good for everybody and lift everybody's living standards up. And by the way, historyhas shown us that we are most vulnerable to war and conflict when people are desperate economically. Andnobody knows that history more than Europe.So that would be number one. Number two is I would like to be able to say that as a consequence of mywork, that we drastically lessened the threat of not only terrorism but also nuclear terrorism. And we can'treduce the threat of a nuclear weapon going off unless those who possess the most nuclear weapons -- theUnited States and Russia -- take serious steps to actually reduce our stockpiles.So we are going to -- so we want to pursue that vigorously in the years ahead. And I had a excellentmeeting with President Medvedev of Russia to get started that process of reducing our nuclear stockpiles,which will then give us greater moral authority to say to Iran, don't develop a nuclear weapon; to say toNorth Korea, don't proliferate nuclear weapons.In my own country, what I think is very important is that we finally get a health care system that is reliableand cost-effective. That's something that -- you know, that's a social safety net that exits in almost all ofEurope that doesn't exist in the United States. You have millions of people who work hard every single day,but if they get sick they could potentially lose everything. And in a country as wealthy as ours, that's notacceptable to me.So we are going to work hard to make sure that we have a health care system that won't be identical towhat you have in Europe -- each country has its own traditions and approaches -- but that provides peoplequality, affordable, accessible health care.And then, I would like to see us in the United States take the lead on a new approach to energy -- becausenone of the developed countries are going to be able to sustain their growth if we don't start using energydifferently, and the world cannot survive all countries using energy in the same ways that we use it.I was meeting with the Indian Prime Minister yesterday after the summit -- a very good and wise man, PrimeMinister Singh -- and he was talking about how Indian growth rates have gone up 9 percent every year.They need to grow at that pace in order to bring hundreds of millions of people in their country out of abjectpoverty, desperate poverty. They have to grow at a rapid pace.Now, he actually is committed to working towards dealing with the climate change issue, but he made a verysimple point, which is a point that I understood before the meeting and all of us should not forget -- and thatis that you cannot expect poor countries, or relatively poor countries, to be partners with us on climatechange if we are not taking the lead, given that our carbon footprint is many times more than theirs percapita. I mean, each one of us in the developed world, I don't care how environmentally conscious you are,how green you are -- I'm sure there are some green folks here --Q Yes!PRESIDENT OBAMA: Yes! I don't care how green you are, you are -- you have a much bigger carbonfootprint than the average Indian, or the average person from China. And so we in developed countries then-- it's critical for us to lead by example by becoming more energy efficient, and we also have to harnesstechnology and shared scientific breakthroughs in order to find more sustainable energy patterns.Now, I've got other things that I want to do, but that's a pretty long list. Let me go on to a few morequestions.All right, now, I know there's some other Americans in the crowd. But do me a favor, Americans, wait till weget back home and I'll do a town hall there -- because I want to hear from my French and German andEuropean friends. All right. And -- wait, wait, wait -- this gentleman right here in the glasses.Q Thank you, Mr. President. I'm a student from Heidelberg, Germany, and -- my mother tongue is German,but my French is not good enough, so I ask my question in English.You mentioned in your speech that we are a lucky generation. We live in peace, we live in democracies andfree states, and we really -- we are very pleased to have this situation in Europe. But this is not the case allover the world, even not in Europe. Look to Belarus, for example; there's an autocratic regime.And so my question concerns the many children all over the world that live in poverty, under human rightsviolation. They have hunger, they have no education, and other problems. So what is your strategy, Mr.President, to solve this problem?PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, it's an excellent question, and the -- first of all, I think one of the things that weshould be very proud of from the G20 summit yesterday was that we made a significant commitment toadditional resources through the IMF and other mechanisms to provide assistance to emerging markets andpoor countries that, as I said, are bearing the burden of a collapse in the financial system that they hadnothing to do with.The problem is so many of these countries had export-oriented markets, and when the economiescontracted in our developing nations, it made them extremely vulnerable. You know, you have a country likeBotswana, which is actually a well-managed country that has made enormous progress, but their mainrevenue generator is diamond sales, and they have literally seen the diamond market collapse -- in partbecause they couldn't get trade financing, in part because the demand in developed countries has droppedoff. So we started to make progress there. Our most important task right now is helping them get throughthis crisis.Over the long term, though, we've got to have a strategy that recognizes that the interest of the developedworld in feeding the hungry, in educating children, that that's not just charity; it's in our interest. There's not adirect correlation between poverty and violence and conflict and terrorism. But I can tell you that if childrenhave no education whatsoever, if young men are standing idle each and every day, and feel completelydetached and completely removed from the modern world, they are more likely, they are more susceptibleto ideologies that appeal to violence and destruction.If you have no health facilities whatsoever in countries in Africa, these days a pandemic can get on a planeand be in Strasbourg or New York City or Chicago overnight. So we better think about making sure thatthere are basic public health facilities and public health infrastructure in those countries, because we can'tshield ourselves from these problems. So that means developed countries have to increase aid, but it alsomeans that the countries who are receiving aid have to use it wisely.My father was from Kenya. And when I traveled to Kenya -- I had just been elected to the United StatesSenate -- everybody was very excited and they greeted me as if I was already a head of state, and therewere people waving and lining the streets. I went to speak at a university and I had to be honest, which was,America has an obligation to provide Kenya help on a whole range of issues, but if Kenya doesn't solve itsown corruption problem, then Kenya will never grow. It will never be able to provide for its own.And so there's nothing wrong with the developed nations insisting that we will increase our commitments,that we will design our aid programs more effectively, that we will open up our markets to trade from poorcountries, but that we will also insist that there is good governance and rule of law, and other critical factorsin order to make these countries work.We spend so much time talking about democracy -- and obviously we should be promoting democracyeverywhere we can. But democracy, a well-functioning society that promotes liberty and equality andfraternity, a well-functioning society does not just depend on going to the ballot box. It also means thatyou're not going to be shaken down by police because the police aren't getting properly paid. It also meansthat if you want to start a business, you don't have to pay a bribe. I mean, there are a whole host of otherfactors that people need to -- need to recognize in building a civil society that allows a country to besuccessful. And hopefully that will -- that approach will be reflected not just in my administration's policiesbut in the policies that are pursued by international agencies around the world. Okay, good.All right, right up -- I've got two of you, so you have to choose one. Which one should I call on? I don't wantto -- you're standing right next to each other. Oops. Well, I'm sorry, you know what, he actually called on the-- no, no, no, I was actually pointing down here. I didn't see those two ladies back there. Here you go, thisone right here. Go ahead.Q Well, hello, Mr. President. I'm sorry, I'm from Chicago, excuse me.PRESIDENT OBAMA: Are you?Q I'm also a student in the high school -- the international high school --PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, no, I'm sorry, if you're American I can't -- Q I'm also French.PRESIDENT OBAMA: Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on. She said she's also French. What does that mean?Q Double nationality.PRESIDENT OBAMA: Dual nationality. What do you think, should we let her ask the question? Okay, goahead.Q Thank you. Do you think that the economic crisis is an opportunity to restructure our industries in anecological and sustainable way? And I also was wondering whether the dog was already in the White Houseor not.PRESIDENT OBAMA: The -- we are getting a dog. This is a very important question in the United States --what kind of dog we're getting and when we're getting it. It should be there soon.I do think that in crisis there's always opportunity if it's used properly. So, for example, in the United Stateswe decided to pass a large stimulus package to help growth at a time when the private sector was having avery difficult time.Now, we could have just spent the money on the same old ways of doing things, but part of what we'vedecided was, if we're going to be spending a lot of government money anyway, why not spend it to doublethe amount of renewable energy? Why not spend it on retrofitting existing government buildings so that wedrastically reduce their energy consumption? Why not start building high-speed rail?One thing that, as an American who is proud as anybody of my country, I am always jealous aboutEuropean trains. And I said to myself, why can't we have -- why can't we have high-speech rail? And sowe're investing in that as well.So on the transportation front, on -- with respect to building construction, on a whole range of issues, we areinvesting in new technologies that will make us more energy efficient. And that is one of the building blocksthat's needed in order for us to reduce our carbon footprint and to work with other countries to achieve theclimate change goals that I think are going to be so important.I'm getting the signal that I've only got time for two more questions. Oh! I'm going to ask that young man inthe suit -- because he got dressed up today. I know he doesn't usually wear a suit -- yes. Go ahead, goahead.Q I just want to know what do you expect from the French and the European countries regarding the war onterror?PRESIDENT OBAMA: Good. That's a good question. Look, I think that over the last seven, eight years, as Isaid in my speech, a lot of tensions have developed between the United States and Europe. And one of thelegacies, I hope, from my administration is, is that we start bringing our historic alliance back together in amuch more effective way.Now, that doesn't mean that we're not going to have honest disagreements. All countries havedisagreements between themselves. But I think that we can work much more effectively and cooperatively,and maintain that core trust that we have towards each other.Nowhere have we seen more suspicion than around questions of war and peace and how we respond toterrorism. When 9/11 happened, Europe responded as a true friend would respond to the United States,saying, ""We are all Americans.""All of us have a stake in ensuring that innocent people who were just going about their business, going towork, suddenly find themselves slaughtered -- all of us have an interest in preventing that kind of vicious,evil act.But after the initial NATO engagement in Afghanistan, we got sidetracked by Iraq, and we have not fullyrecovered that initial insight that we have a mutual interest in ensuring that organizations like al Qaedacannot operate. And I think that it is important for Europe to understand that even though I'm now Presidentand George Bush is no longer President, al Qaeda is still a threat, and that we cannot pretend somehowthat because Barack Hussein Obama got elected as President, suddenly everything is going to be okay.It is going to be a very difficult challenge. Al Qaeda is still bent on carrying out terrorist activity. It is -- don'tfool yourselves -- because some people say, well, you know, if we changed our policies with respect to theIsraeli-Palestinian conflict, or if we were more respectful towards the Muslim world, suddenly theseorganizations would stop threatening us. That's just not the case.It is true that we have to change our behavior in showing the Muslim world greater respect, and changingour language and changing our tone. It is true that we have to work very hard for Israeli-Palestinian peace.But what is also true is that these organizations are willing to kill innocent people because of a twisted,distorted ideology. And we, as democracies and as people who value human life, can't allow thoseorganizations to operate.So here's the bottom line. The United States has reviewed and redesigned its approach to Afghanistan. Webelieve that we cannot just win militarily. We have to win through development aid. We have to win throughincreasing the capacity of the Afghan government to provide basic services to its people and to uphold ruleof law. We have to work with the Pakistani government so that they are more trusted by their population andhave more control so that they can then go -- help us go after these terrorists. We have to encouragediplomacy in the region.So it can't just be a military strategy and we will be in partnership with Europe on the development side andon the diplomatic side. But there will be a military component to it, and Europe should not simply expect theUnited States to shoulder that burden alone. We should not because this is a joint problem and it requiresjoint effort.One last point I will make. In dealing with terrorism, we can't lose sight of our values and who we are. That'swhy I closed Guantanamo. That's why I made very clear that we will not engage in certain interrogationpractices. I don't believe that there is a contradiction between our security and our values. And when youstart sacrificing your values, when you lose yourself, then over the long term that will make you less secure.When we saw what happened in Abu Ghraib, that wasn't good for our security -- that was a recruitment toolfor terrorism. Humiliating people is never a good strategy to battle terrorism.So we are going to conduct our operations in a way that reflect our best selves and make sure that we areproud. And that, in turn, will allow the Europeans, I think, to feel good about our joint efforts, and also not tohave excuses not to participate in those joint efforts. All right?Okay, last question. All right, let me see here. All right, that young lady in the red right there, right there. Shehad all her friends helping her out.Q Thank you. Hi, I'm Enis Otto [phonetic] from Heidelberg. And I'm totally European. And first of all, I wantedto tell you that your name in Hungarian means ""peach.""PRESIDENT OBAMA: Peach?Q Yes.PRESIDENT OBAMA: Oh, okay. Well, how about that. I did not know that.Q Yes, now you know it. And we wanted to know if you -- did you ever regret to have run for presidency tillnow? I mean, well, did you ever ask yourself, am I sure to manage -- yes.PRESIDENT OBAMA: Yes, it's a good question. Michelle definitely asked that question. You know, thereare -- there have been times, certainly, during the campaign, and there have been times over the lastseveral months where you feel a lot of weight on your shoulders. There's no doubt about it.During the campaign, the biggest sacrifice -- the thing that was most difficult was that I was away from myfamily all the time. In addition to missing -- in addition to being jealous about high-speed rail and the nicetrains here, I'm also jealous of the fact that campaigns here only last a few months, whereas in the UnitedStates we were running for two years. So I was away from home all the time, and that was very difficultbecause not only do I have a wonderful wife, but I have two perfect daughters. And so, you know, I missedthem a lot.But the nice thing is now that I'm President, it turns out I have this really nice office in my house called theOval Office, and so it only takes me a few seconds to get upstairs, and I'm home for dinner every night.You also lose privacy and autonomy -- or anonymity. You know, it's very frustrating now -- it used to bewhen I came to Europe, that I could just wander down to a caf and sit and have some wine and watchpeople go by, and go into a little shop, and watch the sun go down. Now I'm in hotel rooms all the time and Ihave security around me all the time. And so just -- you know, losing that ability to just take a walk, that issomething that is frustrating.But having said all that, I truly believe that there's nothing more noble than public service. Now, that doesn'tmean that you have to run for President. You know, you might work for Doctors Without Borders, or youmight volunteer for an -- or you might be somebody working for the United Nations, or you might be themayor of Strasbourg. Right? I mean, they're all -- you might volunteer in your own community.But the point is that what I found at a very young age was that if you only think about yourself -- how muchmoney can I make, what can I buy, how nice is my house, what kind of fancy car do I have -- that over thelong term I think you get bored. I think your life becomes -- I think if you're only thinking about yourself, yourlife becomes diminished; and that the way to live a full life is to think about, what can I do for others? Howcan I be a part of this larger project of making a better world?Now, that could be something as simple as making -- as the joy of taking care of your family and watchingyour children grow and succeed. But I think especially for the young people here, I hope you also considerother ways that you can serve, because the world has so many challenges right now, there's so manyopportunities to make a difference, and it would be a tragedy if all of you who are so talented and energetic,if you let that go to waste; if you just stood back and watched the world pass you by.Better to jump in, get involved. And it does mean that sometimes you'll get criticized and sometimes you'llfail and sometimes you'll be disappointed, but you'll have a great adventure, and at the end of your lifehopefully you'll be able to look back and say, I made a difference.All right. Thank you, everybody.",obama
"Thank you so much. Thank you for this wonderful welcome. Thank you to the people of Prague. Thank youto the people of the Czech Republic. Today, I'm proud to stand here with you in the middle of this great city,in the center of Europe. And, to paraphrase one of my predecessors, I am also proud to be the man whobrought Michelle Obama to Prague.1To Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, to all the dignitaries who are here, thank you for your extraordinaryhospitality. And to the people of the Czech Republic, thank you for your friendship to the United States.I've learned over many years to appreciate the good company and the good humor of the Czech people inmy hometown of Chicago. Behind me is a statue of a hero of the Czech people -- Tomas Masaryk. In 1918,after America had pledged its support for Czech independence, Masaryk spoke to a crowd in Chicago thatwas estimated to be over 100,000. I don't think I can match his record -- but I am honored to follow hisfootsteps from Chicago to Prague. For over a thousand years, Prague has set itself apart from any other city in any other place. You've knownwar and peace. You've seen empires rise and fall. You've led revolutions in the arts and science, in politicsand in poetry. Through it all, the people of Prague have insisted on pursuing their own path, and definingtheir own destiny. And this city -- this Golden City which is both ancient and youthful -- stands as a livingmonument to your unconquerable spirit.When I was born, the world was divided, and our nations were faced with very different circumstances. Fewpeople would have predicted that someone like me would one day become the President of the UnitedStates. Few people would have predicted that an American President would one day be permitted to speakto an audience like this in Prague. Few would have imagined that the Czech Republic would become a freenation, a member of NATO, a leader of a united Europe. Those ideas would have been dismissed asdreams.We are here today because enough people ignored the voices who told them that the world could notchange.We're here today because of the courage of those who stood up and took risks to say that freedom is a rightfor all people, no matter what side of a wall they live on, and no matter what they look like.We are here today because of the Prague Spring -- because the simple and principled pursuit of liberty andopportunity shamed those who relied on the power of tanks and arms to put down the will of a people.We are here today because 20 years ago, the people of this city took to the streets to claim the promise of anew day, and the fundamental human rights that had been denied them for far too long. Sametov Revoluce-- the Velvet Revolution taught us many things. It showed us that peaceful protest could shake thefoundations of an empire, and expose the emptiness of an ideology. It showed us that small countries canplay a pivotal role in world events, and that young people can lead the way in overcoming old conflicts. Andit proved that moral leadership is more powerful than any weapon.That's why I'm speaking to you in the center of a Europe that is peaceful, united and free -- becauseordinary people believed that divisions could be bridged, even when their leaders did not. They believed thatwalls could come down; that peace could prevail.We are here today because Americans and Czechs believed against all odds that today could be possible.Now, we share this common history. But now this generation -- our generation -- cannot stand still. We, too,have a choice to make. As the world has become less divided, it has become more interconnected. Andwe've seen events move faster than our ability to control them -- a global economy in crisis, a changingclimate, the persistent dangers of old conflicts, new threats and the spread of catastrophic weapons.None of these challenges can be solved quickly or easily. But all of them demand that we listen to oneanother and work together; that we focus on our common interests, not on occasional differences; and thatwe reaffirm our shared values, which are stronger than any force that could drive us apart.  That is the workthat we must carry on. That is the work that I have come to Europe to begin.To renew our prosperity, we need action coordinated across borders. That means investments to createnew jobs. That means resisting the walls of protectionism that stand in the way of growth. That means achange in our financial system, with new rules to prevent abuse and future crisis.And we have an obligation to our common prosperity and our common humanity to extend a hand to thoseemerging markets and impoverished people who are suffering the most, even though they may have hadvery little to do with financial crises, which is why we set aside over a trillion dollars for the InternationalMonetary Fund earlier this week, to make sure that everybody -- everybody -- receives some assistance.Now, to protect our planet, now is the time to change the way that we use energy. Together, we mustconfront climate change by ending the world's dependence on fossil fuels, by tapping the power of newsources of energy like the wind and sun, and calling upon all nations to do their part. And I pledge to youthat in this global effort, the United States is now ready to lead.To provide for our common security, we must strengthen our alliance. NATO was founded 60 years ago,after Communism took over Czechoslovakia. That was when the free world learned too late that it could notafford division. So we came together to forge the strongest alliance that the world has ever known. And weshould -- stood shoulder to shoulder -- year after year, decade after decade -- until an Iron Curtain waslifted, and freedom spread like flowing water.This marks the 10th year of NATO membership for the Czech Republic. And I know that many times in the20th century, decisions were made without you at the table. Great powers let you down, or determined yourdestiny without your voice being heard. I am here to say that the United States will never turn its back on thepeople of this nation. We are bound by shared values, shared history -- We are bound by shared values andshared history and the enduring promise of our alliance. NATO's Article V states it clearly: An attack on oneis an attack on all. That is a promise for our time, and for all time.The people of the Czech Republic kept that promise after America was attacked; thousands were killed onour soil, and NATO responded. NATO's mission in Afghanistan is fundamental to the safety of people onboth sides of the Atlantic. We are targeting the same al Qaeda terrorists who have struck from New York toLondon, and helping the Afghan people take responsibility for their future. We are demonstrating that freenations can make common cause on behalf of our common security. And I want you to know that we honorthe sacrifices of the Czech people in this endeavor, and mourn the loss of those you've lost.But no alliance can afford to stand still. We must work together as NATO members so that we havecontingency plans in place to deal with new threats, wherever they may come from. We must strengthen ourcooperation with one another, and with other nations and institutions around the world, to confront dangersthat recognize no borders. And we must pursue constructive relations with Russia on issues of commonconcern. Now, one of those issues that I'll focus on today is fundamental to the security of our nations and to thepeace of the world -- that's the future of nuclear weapons in the 21st century.The existence of thousands of nuclear weapons is the most dangerous legacy of the Cold War. No nuclearwar was fought between the United States and the Soviet Union, but generations lived with the knowledgethat their world could be erased in a single flash of light. Cities like Prague that existed for centuries, thatembodied the beauty and the talent of so much of humanity, would have ceased to exist.Today, the Cold War has disappeared but thousands of those weapons have not. In a strange turn ofhistory, the threat of global nuclear war has gone down, but the risk of a nuclear attack has gone up. Morenations have acquired these weapons. Testing has continued. Black market trade in nuclear secrets andnuclear materials abound. The technology to build a bomb has spread. Terrorists are determined to buy,build or steal one. Our efforts to contain these dangers are centered on a global non-proliferation regime,but as more people and nations break the rules, we could reach the point where the center cannot hold.Now, understand, this matters to people everywhere. One nuclear weapon exploded in one city -- be it NewYork or Moscow, Islamabad or Mumbai, Tokyo or Tel Aviv, Paris or Prague -- could kill hundreds ofthousands of people. And no matter where it happens, there is no end to what the consequences might be --for our global safety, our security, our society, our economy, to our ultimate survival.Some argue that the spread of these weapons cannot be stopped, cannot be checked -- that we aredestined to live in a world where more nations and more people possess the ultimate tools of destruction.Such fatalism is a deadly adversary, for if we believe that the spread of nuclear weapons is inevitable, thenin some way we are admitting to ourselves that the use of nuclear weapons is inevitable.Just as we stood for freedom in the 20th century, we must stand together for the right of people everywhereto live free from fear in the 21st century. And as nuclear power -- as a nuclear power, as the only nuclearpower to have used a nuclear weapon, the United States has a moral responsibility to act. We cannotsucceed in this endeavor alone, but we can lead it, we can start it.So today, I state clearly and with conviction America's commitment to seek the peace and security of aworld without nuclear weapons. I'm not naive. This goal will not be reached quickly -- perhaps not in mylifetime. It will take patience and persistence. But now we, too, must ignore the voices who tell us that theworld cannot change. We have to insist, ""Yes, we can."" Now, let me describe to you the trajectory we need to be on. First, the United States will take concrete stepstowards a world without nuclear weapons. To put an end to Cold War thinking, we will reduce the role ofnuclear weapons in our national security strategy, and urge others to do the same. Make no mistake: Aslong as these weapons exist, the United States will maintain a safe, secure and effective arsenal to deterany adversary, and guarantee that defense to our allies -- including the Czech Republic. But we will beginthe work of reducing our arsenal.To reduce our warheads and stockpiles, we will negotiate a new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with theRussians this year. President Medvedev and I began this process in London, and will seek a newagreement by the end of this year that is legally binding and sufficiently bold. And this will set the stage forfurther cuts, and we will seek to include all nuclear weapons states in this endeavor.To achieve a global ban on nuclear testing, my administration will immediately and aggressively pursue U.S.ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. After more than five decades of talks, it is time for thetesting of nuclear weapons to finally be banned.And to cut off the building blocks needed for a bomb, the United States will seek a new treaty that verifiablyends the production of fissile materials intended for use in state nuclear weapons. If we are serious aboutstopping the spread of these weapons, then we should put an end to the dedicated production of weapons-grade materials that create them. That's the first step.Second, together we will strengthen the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as a basis for cooperation.The basic bargain is sound: Countries with nuclear weapons will move towards disarmament, countrieswithout nuclear weapons will not acquire them, and all countries can access peaceful nuclear energy. Tostrengthen the treaty, we should embrace several principles. We need more resources and authority tostrengthen international inspections. We need real and immediate consequences for countries caughtbreaking the rules or trying to leave the treaty without cause.And we should build a new framework for civil nuclear cooperation, including an international fuel bank, sothat countries can access peaceful power without increasing the risks of proliferation. That must be the rightof every nation that renounces nuclear weapons, especially developing countries embarking on peacefulprograms. And no approach will succeed if it's based on the denial of rights to nations that play by the rules.We must harness the power of nuclear energy on behalf of our efforts to combat climate change, and toadvance peace opportunity for all people.But we go forward with no illusions. Some countries will break the rules. That's why we need a structure inplace that ensures when any nation does, they will face consequences.Just this morning, we were reminded again of why we need a new and more rigorous approach to addressthis threat. North Korea broke the rules once again by testing a rocket that could be used for long rangemissiles. This provocation underscores the need for action -- not just this afternoon at the U.N. SecurityCouncil, but in our determination to prevent the spread of these weapons.Rules must be binding. Violations must be punished. Words must mean something. The world must standtogether to prevent the spread of these weapons. Now is the time for a strong international response -- nowis the time for a strong international response, and North Korea must know that the path to security andrespect will never come through threats and illegal weapons. All nations must come together to build astronger, global regime. And that's why we must stand shoulder to shoulder to pressure the North Koreansto change course.Iran has yet to build a nuclear weapon. My administration will seek engagement with Iran based on mutualinterests and mutual respect. We believe in dialogue. But in that dialogue we will present a clear choice. Wewant Iran to take its rightful place in the community of nations, politically and economically. We will supportIran's right to peaceful nuclear energy with rigorous inspections. That's a path that the Islamic Republic cantake. Or the government can choose increased isolation, international pressure, and a potential nucleararms race in the region that will increase insecurity for all.So let me be clear: Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile activity poses a real threat, not just to the UnitedStates, but to Iran's neighbors and our allies. The Czech Republic and Poland have been courageous inagreeing to host a defense against these missiles. As long as the threat from Iran persists, we will goforward with a missile defense system that is cost-effective and proven. If the Iranian threat is eliminated, wewill have a stronger basis for security, and the driving force for missile defense construction in Europe willbe removed.So, finally, we must ensure that terrorists never acquire a nuclear weapon. This is the most immediate andextreme threat to global security. One terrorist with one nuclear weapon could unleash massive destruction.Al Qaeda has said it seeks a bomb and that it would have no problem with using it. And we know that thereis unsecured nuclear material across the globe. To protect our people, we must act with a sense of purposewithout delay.So today I am announcing a new international effort to secure all vulnerable nuclear material around theworld within four years. We will set new standards, expand our cooperation with Russia, pursue newpartnerships to lock down these sensitive materials.We must also build on our efforts to break up black markets, detect and intercept materials in transit, anduse financial tools to disrupt this dangerous trade. Because this threat will be lasting, we should cometogether to turn efforts such as the Proliferation Security Initiative and the Global Initiative to CombatNuclear Terrorism into durable international institutions. And we should start by having a Global Summit onNuclear Security that the United States will host within the next year.Now, I know that there are some who will question whether we can act on such a broad agenda. There arethose who doubt whether true international cooperation is possible, given inevitable differences amongnations. And there are those who hear talk of a world without nuclear weapons and doubt whether it's worthsetting a goal that seems impossible to achieve.But make no mistake: We know where that road leads. When nations and peoples allow themselves to bedefined by their differences, the gulf between them widens. When we fail to pursue peace, then it staysforever beyond our grasp. We know the path when we choose fear over hope. To denounce or shrug off acall for cooperation is an easy but also a cowardly thing to do. That's how wars begin. That's where humanprogress ends.There is violence and injustice in our world that must be confronted. We must confront it not by splittingapart but by standing together as free nations, as free people. I know that a call to arms can stir the souls ofmen and women more than a call to lay them down. But that is why the voices for peace and progress mustbe raised together.Those are the voices that still echo through the streets of Prague. Those are the ghosts of 1968. Thosewere the joyful sounds of the Velvet Revolution. Those were the Czechs who helped bring down a nuclear-armed empire without firing a shot.Human destiny will be what we make of it. And here in Prague, let us honor our past by reaching for a betterfuture. Let us bridge our divisions, build upon our hopes, accept our responsibility to leave this world moreprosperous and more peaceful than we found it. Together we can do it.Thank you very much. Thank you, Prague.1 Reference to President John F.

"Mr. Speaker, Madam Deputy Speaker, distinguished members, I am honored to speak in this chamber, andI am committed to renewing the alliance between our nations and the friendship between our people.This is my first trip overseas as President of the United States. I've been to the G20 summit in London, andthe NATO summit in Strasbourg, and the European Union summit in Prague. Some people have asked meif I chose to continue my travels to Ankara and Istanbul to send a message to the world. And my answer issimple: Evet -- yes. Turkey is a critical ally. Turkey is an important part of Europe. And Turkey and theUnited States must stand together -- and work together -- to overcome the challenges of our time.This morning I had the great privilege of visiting the tomb of your extraordinary founder of your republic. AndI was deeply impressed by this beautiful memorial to a man who did so much to shape the course of history.But it is also clear that the greatest monument to Ataturk's life is not something that can be cast in stone andmarble. His greatest legacy is Turkey's strong, vibrant, secular democracy, and that is the work that thisassembly carries on today.This future was not easily assured, it was not guaranteed. At the end of World War I, Turkey could havesuccumbed to the foreign powers that were trying to claim its territory, or sought to restore an ancientempire. But Turkey chose a different future. You freed yourself from foreign control, and you founded arepublic that commands the respect of the United States and the wider world.And there is a simple truth to this story: Turkey's democracy is your own achievement. It was not forcedupon you by any outside power, nor did it come without struggle and sacrifice. Turkey draws strength fromboth the successes of the past, and from the efforts of each generation of Turks that makes new progressfor your people.Now, my country's democracy has its own story. The general who led America in revolution and governedas our first President was, as many of you know, George Washington. And like you, we built a grandmonument to honor our founding father -- a towering obelisk that stands in the heart of the capital city thatbears Washington's name. I can see the Washington Monument from the window of the White House everyday.It took decades to build. There were frequent delays. Over time, more and more people contributed to helpmake this monument the inspiring structure that still stands tall today. Among those who came to our aidwere friends from all across the world who offered their own tributes to Washington and the country hehelped to found.And one of those tributes came from Istanbul. Ottoman Sultan Abdulmecid sent a marble plaque that helpedto build the Washington Monument. Inscribed in the plaque was a poem that began with a few simple words:""So as to strengthen the friendship between the two countries."" Over 150 years have passed since thosewords were carved into marble. Our nations have changed in many ways. But our friendship is strong, andour alliance endures.It is a friendship that flourished in the years after World War II, when President Truman committed ournation to the defense of Turkey's freedom and sovereignty, and Turkey committed itself into the NATOAlliance. Turkish troops have served by our side from Korea to Kosovo to Kabul. Together, we withstood thegreat test of the Cold War. Trade between our nations has steadily advanced. So has cooperation inscience and research.The ties among our people have deepened, as well, and more and more Americans of Turkish origin liveand work and succeed within our borders. And as a basketball fan, I've even noticed that Hedo Turkogluand Mehmet Okur have got some pretty good basketball games.The United States and Turkey have not always agreed on every issue, and that's to be expected -- no twonations do. But we have stood together through many challenges over the last 60 years. And because of thestrength of our alliance and the endurance of our friendship, both America and Turkey are stronger and theworld is more secure.Now, our two democracies are confronted by an unprecedented set of challenges: An economic crisis thatrecognizes no borders; extremism that leads to the killing of innocent men and women and children; strainson our energy supply and a changing climate; the proliferation of the world's deadliest weapons; and thepersistence of tragic conflict.These are the great tests of our young century. And the choices that we make in the coming years willdetermine whether the future will be shaped by fear or by freedom; by poverty or by prosperity; by strife orby a just, secure and lasting peace.This much is certain: No one nation can confront these challenges alone, and all nations have a stake inovercoming them. That is why we must listen to one another, and seek common ground. That is why wemust build on our mutual interests, and rise above our differences. We are stronger when we act together.That is the message that I've carried with me throughout this trip to Europe. That is the message that Idelivered when I had the privilege of meeting with your President and with your Prime Minister. That will bethe approach of the United States of America going forward.Already, America and Turkey are working with the G20 on an unprecedented response to an unprecedentedeconomic crisis. Now, this past week, we came together to ensure that the world's largest economies takestrong and coordinated action to stimulate growth and restore the flow of credit; to reject the pressures ofprotectionism, and to extend a hand to developing countries and the people hit hardest by this downturn;and to dramatically reform our regulatory system so that the world never faces a crisis like this again.As we go forward, the United States and Turkey can pursue many opportunities to serve prosperity for ourpeople. The President and I this morning talked about expanding the ties of commerce and trade. There'senormous opportunity when it comes to energy to create jobs. And we can increase new sources to not onlyfree ourselves from dependence of other energies -- other countries' energy sources, but also to combatclimate change. We should build on our Clean Technology Fund to leverage efficiency and renewableenergy investments in Turkey. And to power markets in Turkey and Europe, the United States will continueto support your central role as an East-West corridor for oil and natural gas.This economic cooperation only reinforces the common security that Europe and the United States sharewith Turkey as a NATO ally, and the common values that we share as democracies. So in meeting thechallenges of the 21st century, we must seek the strength of a Europe that is truly united, peaceful and free.So let me be clear: The United States strongly supports Turkey's bid to become a member of the EuropeanUnion. We speak not as members of the EU, but as close friends of both Turkey and Europe. Turkey hasbeen a resolute ally and a responsible partner in transatlantic and European institutions. Turkey is bound toEurope by more than the bridges over the Bosphorous. Centuries of shared history, culture, and commercebring you together. Europe gains by the diversity of ethnicity, tradition and faith -- it is not diminished by it.And Turkish membership would broaden and strengthen Europe's foundation once more.Now, of course, Turkey has its own responsibilities. And you've made important progress towardsmembership. But I also know that Turkey has pursued difficult political reforms not simply because it's goodfor EU membership, but because it's right for Turkey.In the last several years, you've abolished state security courts, you've expanded the right to counsel.You've reformed the penal code and strengthened laws that govern the freedom of the press and assembly.You've lifted bans on teaching and broadcasting Kurdish, and the world noted with respect the importantsignal sent through a new state Kurdish television station.These achievements have created new laws that must be implemented, and a momentum that should besustained. For democracies cannot be static -- they must move forward. Freedom of religion and expressionlead to a strong and vibrant civil society that only strengthens the state, which is why steps like reopeningHalki Seminary will send such an important signal inside Turkey and beyond. An enduring commitment tothe rule of law is the only way to achieve the security that comes from justice for all people. Robust minorityrights let societies benefit from the full measure of contributions from all citizens.I say this as the President of a country that not very long ago made it hard for somebody who looks like meto vote, much less be President of the United States. But it is precisely that capacity to change that enrichesour countries. Every challenge that we face is more easily met if we tend to our own democratic foundation.This work is never over. That's why, in the United States, we recently ordered the prison at GuantanamoBay closed. That's why we prohibited -- without exception or equivocation -- the use of torture. All of us haveto change. And sometimes change is hard.Another issue that confronts all democracies as they move to the future is how we deal with the past. TheUnited States is still working through some of our own darker periods in our history. Facing the WashingtonMonument that I spoke of is a memorial of Abraham Lincoln, the man who freed those who were enslavedeven after Washington led our Revolution. Our country still struggles with the legacies of slavery andsegregation, the past treatment of Native Americans.Human endeavor is by its nature imperfect. History is often tragic, but unresolved, it can be a heavy weight.Each country must work through its past. And reckoning with the past can help us seize a better future. Iknow there's strong views in this chamber about the terrible events of 1915. And while there's been a gooddeal of commentary about my views, it's really about how the Turkish and Armenian people deal with thepast. And the best way forward for the Turkish and Armenian people is a process that works through thepast in a way that is honest, open and constructive.We've already seen historic and courageous steps taken by Turkish and Armenian leaders. These contactshold out the promise of a new day. An open border would return the Turkish and Armenian people to apeaceful and prosperous coexistence that would serve both of your nations. So I want you to know that theUnited States strongly supports the full normalization of relations between Turkey and Armenia. It is a causeworth working towards.It speaks to Turkey's leadership that you are poised to be the only country in the region to have normal andpeaceful relations with all the South Caucasus nations. And to advance that peace, you can play aconstructive role in helping to resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, which has continued for far too long.Advancing peace also includes the disputes that persist in the Eastern Mediterranean. And here there's acause for hope. The two Cypriot leaders have an opportunity through their commitment to negotiationsunder the United Nations Good Offices Mission. The United States is willing to offer all the help sought bythe parties as they work towards a just and lasting settlement that reunifies Cyprus into a bizonal andbicommunal federation.These efforts speak to one part of the critical region that surrounds Turkey. And when we consider thechallenges before us, on issue after issue, we share common goals. In the Middle East, we share the goalof a lasting peace between Israel and its neighbors. Let me be clear: The United States strongly supportsthe goal of two states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security. That is a goal sharedby Palestinians, Israelis, and people of goodwill around the world. That is a goal that the parties agreed to inthe road map and at Annapolis. That is a goal that I will actively pursue as President of the United States.We know the road ahead will be difficult. Both Israelis and Palestinians must take steps that are necessaryto build confidence and trust.Both Israelis and Palestinians, both must live up to the commitments they have made. Both must overcomelongstanding passions and the politics of the moment to make progress towards a secure and lasting peace.The United States and Turkey can help the Palestinians and Israelis make this journey. Like the UnitedStates, Turkey has been a friend and partner in Israel's quest for security. And like the United States, youseek a future of opportunity and statehood for the Palestinians. So now, working together, we must not giveinto pessimism and mistrust. We must pursue every opportunity for progress, as you've done by supportingnegotiations between Syria and Israel. We must extend a hand to those Palestinians who are in need, whilehelping them strengthen their own institutions. We must reject the use of terror, and recognize that Israel'ssecurity concerns are legitimate.The peace of the region will also be advanced if Iran forgoes any nuclear weapons ambitions. Now, as Imade clear in Prague yesterday, no one is served by the spread of nuclear weapons, least of all Turkey.You live in a difficult region and a nuclear arm race would not serve the security of this nation well. This partof the world has known enough violence. It has known enough hatred. It does not need a race for an ever-more powerful tool of destruction.Now, I have made it clear to the people and leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran that the United Statesseeks engagement based on mutual interest and mutual respect. We want Iran to play its rightful role in thecommunity of nations. Iran is a great civilization. We want them to engage in the economic and politicalintegration that brings prosperity and security. But Iran's leaders must choose whether they will try to build aweapon or build a better future for their people.So both Turkey and the United States support a secure and united Iraq that does not serve as a safe havenfor terrorists. I know there were differences about whether to go to war. There were differences within myown country, as well. But now we must come together as we end this war responsibly, because the future ofIraq is inseparable from the future of the broader region. As I've already announced, and many of you areaware, the United States will remove our combat brigades by the end of next August, while working with theIraqi government as they take responsibility for security. And we will work with Iraq, Turkey, and all Iraq'sneighbors, to forge a new dialogue that reconciles differences and advances our common security.Make no mistake, though: Iraq, Turkey, and the United States face a common threat from terrorism. Thatincludes the al Qaeda terrorists who have sought to drive Iraqis apart and destroy their country. Thatincludes the PKK. There is no excuse for terror against any nation. As President, and as a NATO ally, Ipledge that you will have our support against the terrorist activities of the PKK or anyone else. These effortswill be strengthened by the continued work to build ties of cooperation between Turkey, the Iraqigovernment, and Iraq's Kurdish leaders, and by your continued efforts to promote education and opportunityand democracy for the Kurdish population here inside Turkey.Finally, we share the common goal of denying al Qaeda a safe haven in Pakistan or Afghanistan. The worldhas come too far to let this region backslide, and to let al Qaeda terrorists plot further attacks. That's why weare committed to a more focused effort to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda. That is why we areincreasing our efforts to train Afghans to sustain their own security, and to reconcile former adversaries.That's why we are increasing our support for the people of Afghanistan and Pakistan, so that we stand onthe side not only of security, but also of opportunity and the promise of a better life.Turkey has been a true partner. Your troops were among the first in the International Security AssistanceForce. You have sacrificed much in this endeavor. Now we must achieve our goals together. I appreciatethat you've offered to help us train and support Afghan security forces, and expand opportunity across theregion. Together, we can rise to meet this challenge like we have so many before.I know there have been difficulties these last few years. I know that the trust that binds the United Statesand Turkey has been strained, and I know that strain is shared in many places where the Muslim faith ispracticed. So let me say this as clearly as I can: The United States is not, and will never be, at war withIslam. In fact, our partnership with the Muslim world is critical not just in rolling back the violent ideologiesthat people of all faiths reject, but also to strengthen opportunity for all its people.I also want to be clear that America's relationship with the Muslim community, the Muslim world, cannot, andwill not, just be based upon opposition to terrorism. We seek broader engagement based on mutual interestand mutual respect. We will listen carefully, we will bridge misunderstandings, and we will seek commonground. We will be respectful, even when we do not agree. We will convey our deep appreciation for theIslamic faith, which has done so much over the centuries to shape the world -- including in my own country.The United States has been enriched by Muslim Americans. Many other Americans have Muslims in theirfamilies or have lived in a Muslim-majority country. I know, because I am one of them.Above all, above all we will demonstrate through actions our commitment to a better future. I want to helpmore children get the education that they need to succeed. We want to promote health care in places wherepeople are vulnerable. We want to expand the trade and investment that can bring prosperity for all people.In the months ahead, I will present specific programs to advance these goals. Our focus will be on what wecan do, in partnership with people across the Muslim world, to advance our common hopes and ourcommon dreams. And when people look back on this time, let it be said of America that we extended thehand of friendship to all people.There's an old Turkish proverb: ""You cannot put out fire with flames."" America knows this. Turkey knowsthis. There's some who must be met by force, they will not compromise. But force alone cannot solve ourproblems, and it is no alternative to extremism. The future must belong to those who create, not those whodestroy. That is the future we must work for, and we must work for it together.I know there are those who like to debate Turkey's future. They see your country at the crossroads ofcontinents, and touched by the currents of history. They know that this has been a place where civilizationsmeet, and different peoples come together. They wonder whether you will be pulled in one direction oranother.But I believe here is what they don't understand: Turkey's greatness lies in your ability to be at the center ofthings. This is not where East and West divide -- this is where they come together. In the beauty of yourculture. In the richness of your history. In the strength of your democracy. In your hopes for tomorrow. I amhonored to stand here with you -- to look forward to the future that we must reach for together -- and toreaffirm America's commitment to our strong and enduring friendship.Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.",obama
"Thank you very much, Mr. President.You know, four years ago, following the most devastating attack in our history, this Bodypassed the USA PATRIOT Act in order to give our Nation's law enforcement the tools theyneeded to track down terrorists who plot and lurk within our own borders and all over theworld; terrorists who, right now, are looking to exploit weaknesses in our laws and oursecurity to carry out attacks that may be even deadlier than those that took place onSeptember 11th.We all agree that we need legislation to make it harder for suspected terrorists to goundetected in this country. And we all agree that we needed to make it harder for them toorganize and strategize and get flight licenses and sneak across our borders. Americanseverywhere wanted to do that.But soon after the PATRIOT Act passed, a few years before I even arrived here in the Senate,I began hearing concerns from people of every background and political leaning that this law,the very purpose of which was to protect us, was also threatening to violate some of therights and freedoms that we hold most dear; that it didn't just provide law enforcement thepowers it needed to keep us safe but powers that it didn't need to invade our privacy withoutcause or suspicion.Now, in Washington, this issue has tended to degenerate into the typical either/or debate:Either we protect our people from terror or we protect our most cherished principles. I wouldsuggest, Mr. President, that this is a false choice. It asks too little of us and it assumes toolittle about America.That's why, as it's come to time to reauthorize the USA PATRIOT Act, we've been working in abipartisan way to do both -- to show American people that we can track down terroristswithout trampling on our civil liberties, to show the American people that the FederalGovernment will only issue warrants and execute searches because it needs to do so, notbecause it can do so.What we have been trying to achieve under the leadership of a bipartisan group of Senators issome accountability in this process to get answers and see evidence where there is suspicion.Several weeks ago, these efforts bore fruit. The Judiciary Committee and the U.S. -- U.S.Senate managed to pass a piece of bipartisan legislation that, while I can't say is perfect, wasable to address some of the most serious problems in the existing law.Unfortunately, that strong bipartisan legislation has been tossed aside in conference. Instead,we've been forced to consider a piece of rushed legislation that fails to address the concernsof Members of both parties as well as the American people.This is legislation that puts our own Justice Department above the law. When national securityletters are issued, they allow Federal agents to conduct any search on any American, nomatter how extensive, how wide ranging, without ever going before a judge to prove that thesearch is necessary. All that is needed is a signoff from a local FBI agent. That's it.Once a business or a person receives notification that they will be searched, they areprohibited from telling anyone about it and they're even prohibited from challenging thisautomatic gag order in court. Even though judges have already found that similar restrictionsviolate the first amendment, this conference report disregards the case law and the right tochallenge the gag order.If you do decide to consult an attorney for legal advice, hold on. You will have to tell the FBIthat you've done so. Think about that: You want to talk to a lawyer about whether or not youractions are going to be causing you to get into trouble, you've got to tell the FBI that you'reconsulting a lawyer. This is unheard of. There is no such requirement in any other area of thelaw. I see no reason why it's justified here.And if someone wants to know why their own Government has decided to go on a fishingexpedition through every personal record or private document, through the library books thatyou read, the phone calls that you've made, the e-mails that you've sent, this legislation givespeople no rights to appeal the need for such a search in a court of law.No judge will hear your plea; no jury will hear your case. This is just plain wrong. And thereare Republican Senators as well as Democratic Senators that recognize that it's plain wrong.Giving law enforcement the tools they need to investigate suspicious activities is one thingand it's the right thing; but doing it without any real oversight seriously jeopardizes the rightsof all Americans and the ideals America stands for.Now, supporters of this conference report have argued we should just hold our noses andsupport this legislation because it's not going to get any better. That is not a good argument.We can do better. We've got time to do better. It doesn't convince me that I should supportthis report. I believe we owe it to the Nation, we owe it to those who fought for our civilliberties, we owe it to the future and our children to make sure that we craft the kind oflegislation that would make us proud, not just legislation that we would settle for becausewe're in a rush. We don't have to settle for a PATRIOT Act that sacrifices our liberties or oursafety. We can have one that secures both.Now, there have been proposals on both sides of the aisle and in both Houses of Congress toextend the PATRIOT Act for three months so that we can reach an agreement on this bill thatis well thought through. I support these efforts and will oppose cloture on what I consider tobe this unacceptable conference report.Mr. President, I thank you. I yield the floor....",obama
"Thank you. Thank you, guys. Let me say Multinational Force Iraq, Multinational Corps Iraq,Multinational Security Transition Command Iraq First Corps, America's Corp Band: Thanks toall of you. Listen, I am so honored.Audience Member:  We love you.President Obama: I love you back. I am honored -- I'm honored and grateful to be with all ofyou.  And I'm not going to talk long because I want to shake as many hands as I can. And I'vebeen talking all week. But there's a couple of things I want to say.  Number one, thank you.You know, when I was at Camp Lejeune I spoke about what it means for America to see ourbest and brightest, our finest young men and women serve us. And what I said then issomething that I want to repeat to you, which is: You have performed brilliantly in everymission that has been given to you.Under enormous strain and under enormous sacrifice, through controversy and difficulty andpolitics, you've kept your eyes focused on just doing your job. And because of that, everymission that's been assigned -- from getting rid of Saddam, to reducing violence, to stabilizingthe country, to facilitating elections -- you have given Iraq the opportunity to stand on its ownas a democratic country. That is an extraordinary achievement, and for that you have thethanks of the American people.  That's point number one.Point number two is, this is going to be a critical period, these next 18 months.  I was justdiscussing this with your commander, but I think it's something that all of you know.  It istime for us to transition to the Iraqis. They need to take responsibility for their country and fortheir sovereignty.And in order for them to do that, they have got to make political accommodations.  They'regoing to have to decide that they want to resolve their differences through constitutionalmeans and legal means.  They are going to have to focus on providing government servicesthat encourage confidence among their citizens.All those things they have to do. We can't do it for them. But what we can do is make surethat we are a stalwart partner, that we are working alongside them, that we are committed totheir success, that in terms of training their security forces, training their civilian forces inorder to achieve a more effective government, they know that they have a steady partnerwith us.And so just as we thank you for what you've already accomplished, I want to say thank youbecause you will be critical in terms of us being able to make sure that Iraq is stable, that it isnot a safe haven for terrorists, that it is a good neighbor and a good ally, and we can startbringing our folks home. So now is not the time to lose focus. We have to be even morefocused than we've been in order to achieve success.The last point I want to make is I know how hard it's been on a lot of you. You've been awayfrom your families, many of you for multiple rotations. You've seen buddies of yours injuredand you remember those who have made the ultimate sacrifice.There are probably some people here who have seen children born and have been missingwatching them grow up.  There are many of you who have listened to your spouse and theextraordinary sacrifices that they have to make when you're gone.And so I want you to know that Michelle and myself are doing everything -- are doingeverything we can to provide additional support for military families. The federal budget that Ihave introduced increases support for military families. We are going to do everythingrequired to make sure that the commitment we make to our veterans is met, and that peopledon't have to fight for what they have earned as a consequence of their service.The main point I want to make is we have not forgotten what you have already done, we aregrateful for what you will do, and as long as I am in the White House, you are going to get thesupport that you need and the thanks that you deserve from a grateful nation.So thank you very much everybody. God bless you.God bless the United States of America.",obama
"Well, to President DeGioia, thank you so much for the gracious introduction, and thanks for bringing yourfamily -- including JT -- appreciate you. We're going to invite him over, hang out with the girls. He's a prettygood-looking young man.To Mayor Adrian Fenty, who's doing such a great job in this city, thank you so much for your attendance. ToRepresentative Donna Edwards, who is here and represents Maryland's 4th District, thank you.To Georgetown University students, it is great to be here. Well, it is good to be back. I appeared in this roomduring the campaign and had a wonderful reception then, and it's wonderful to be back and be with all ofyou.We're going to talk about the economy today. And I was telling President DeGioia this may be a slightlylonger speech than I usually give, but it's a slightly bigger topic, and that is how we are going to deal with somany of our economic challenges.You know, it's been 12 weeks now since my administration began. And I think that even our critics wouldagree that at the very least, we've been busy. In just under three months, we've responded to anextraordinary set of economic challenges with extraordinary action -- action that's been unprecedented bothin terms of its scale and its speed.And I know that some have accused us of taking on too much at once. Others believe we haven't doneenough. And many Americans are simply wondering how all of our different programs and policies fittogether in a single, overarching strategy that will move this economy from recession to recovery andultimately to prosperity.So today, I want to step back for a moment and explain our strategy as clearly as I can. This is going to beprose, and not poetry. I want to talk about what we've done, why we've done it, and what we have left to do.I want to update you on the progress we've made, but I also want to be honest about the pitfalls that maystill lie ahead.Most of all, I want every American to know that each action we take and each policy we pursue is driven bya larger vision of America's future -- a future where sustained economic growth creates good jobs and risingincomes; a future where prosperity is fueled not by excessive debt, or reckless speculation, or fleetingprofits, but is instead built by skilled, productive workers, by sound investments that will spread opportunityat home and allow this nation to lead the world in the technologies and the innovation and discoveries thatwill shape the 21st century. That's the America I see. That's the America that Georgetown is preparing somany of you for. That is the future that I know that we can have.Now, to understand how we get there, we first need to understand how we got here.Recessions are not uncommon. Markets and economies naturally ebb and flow, as we've seen many timesin our history. But this recession is different. This recession was not caused by a normal downturn in thebusiness cycle. It was caused by a perfect storm of irresponsibility and poor decision-making that stretchedfrom Wall Street to Washington to Main Street.As has been widely reported, it started in the housing market. During the course of the decade, the formulafor buying a house changed: Instead of saving their pennies to buy their dream house, many Americansfound that suddenly they could take out loans that by traditional standards their incomes just could notsupport. Others were tricked into signing these subprime loans by lenders who were trying to make a quickprofit. The reason these loans were so readily available was that Wall Street saw big profits to be made.Investment banks would buy and package together these questionable mortgages into securities, arguingthat by pooling the mortgages the risks had somehow been reduced. And credit agencies that are supposedto help investors determine the soundness of various investments stamped the securities with their safestrating when they should have been labeled ""Buyer Beware.""No one really knew what the actual value of these securities were, no one fully understood what the riskswere. But since the housing market was booming and prices were rising, banks and investors just keptbuying and selling them, always passing off the risk to someone else for a greater profit without having totake any of the ultimate responsibility. Banks took on more debt than they could handle.The government-chartered companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, whose traditional mandate was to helpsupport traditional mortgages, decided to get in on the action by buying and holding billions of dollars ofthese securities. AIG, the biggest insurer in the world that had a very traditional insurance business that wasvery profitable, decided to make profits suddenly by selling billions of dollars of complicated financialinstruments that supposedly insured these securities. Everybody was making record profits -- except thewealth created was real only on paper. And as the bubble grew, there was almost no accountability oroversight from anyone in Washington.Then the housing bubble burst. Home prices fell. People began to default on their subprime mortgages. Andthe value of all those loans and securities plummeted. Banks and investors couldn't find anyone to buythem. Greed gave way to fear. Investors pulled their money out of the market. Large financial institutionsthat didn't have enough money on hand to pay off all their obligations collapsed. Other banks held on tight totheir money and simply stopped lending.Now, this is when the crisis spread from Wall Street to Main Street. After all, the ability to get a loan is howyou finance the purchase of everything from a home to a car to, as you all know very well, a collegeeducation. It's how stores stock their shelves, and farms buy equipment, and businesses make payroll. Sowhen banks stopped lending money, businesses started laying off workers. When laid-off workers had lessmoney to spend, businesses were forced to lay off even more workers. When people couldn't get a car loan,a bad situation at the auto companies became even worse. When people couldn't get home loans, the crisisin the housing market only deepened. Because the infected securities were being traded worldwide andother nations also had weak regulations, this recession soon became global. And when other nations can'tafford to buy our goods, it slows our economy even further.So this is the situation, the downward spiral that we confronted on the day that we took office. So our mosturgent task has been to clear away the wreckage, repair the immediate damage to the economy, and doeverything we can to prevent a larger collapse. And since the problems we face are all working off eachother to feed a vicious economic downturn, we've had no choice but to attack all fronts of our economiccrisis simultaneously.The first step was to fight a severe shortage of demand in the economy. So the Federal Reserve did this bydramatically lowering interest rates last year in order to boost investment. My administration and Congressboosted demand by passing the largest recovery plan in our nation's history. It's a plan that's already in theprocess of saving or creating 3.5 million jobs over the next two years. It's putting money directly intopeople's pockets with a tax cut for 95 percent of working families that's now showing up in paychecks acrossAmerica. And to cushion the blow of this recession, we also provided extended unemployment benefits andcontinued health care coverage to Americans who've lost their jobs through no fault of their own.Now, you will recall that some argued this recovery plan is a case of irresponsible government spending,that it's somehow to blame for our long-term deficit projections, and that the federal government should becutting instead of increasing spending right now. So I want to tackle this argument head on.To begin with, economists on both the left and the right agree that the last thing a government should do inthe middle of a recession is to cut back on spending. You see, when this recession began, many families sataround the kitchen table and tried to figure out where they could cut back. And so have many businesses.And this is a completely reasonable and understandable reaction. But if everybody -- if everybody -- if everyfamily in America, if every business in America cuts back all at once, then no one is spending any money,which means there are no customers, which means there are more layoffs, which means the economy getseven worse. That's why the government has to step in and temporarily boost spending in order to stimulatedemand. That's exactly what we're doing right now.Second, I absolutely agree that our long-term deficit is a major problem that we have to fix. But the fact isthat this recovery plan represents only a tiny fraction of that long-term deficit. As I'll discuss in a moment, thekey to dealing with our long-term deficit and our national debt is to get a handle on out-of-control health carecosts -- not to stand idly by as the economy goes into free fall.So the recovery plan has been the first step in confronting this economic crisis. The second step has beento heal our financial system so that credit is once again flowing to the businesses and families who rely on it.The heart of this financial crisis is that too many banks and other financial institutions simply stoppedlending money. In a climate of fear, banks were unable to replace their losses from some of those badmortgages by raising new capital on their own, and they were unwilling to lend the money they did havebecause they were afraid that no one would pay it back. It's for this reason that the last administration usedwhat they called the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, to provide these banks with temporaryfinancial assistance in order to get them lending again.Now, I understand that TARP is not popular, and I have to say that I don't agree with some of the ways theTARP program was managed, but I do agree with the broader rationale that we must provide banks with thecapital and the confidence necessary to start lending again. That's the purpose of the stress tests that willsoon tell us how much additional capital will be needed to support lending at our largest banks. Ideally,these needs will be met by private investors who are willing to put in money to these banks. But where that'snot possible, and banks require substantial additional resources from the government, then we will holdaccountable those who are responsible, we'll force the necessary adjustments, we'll provide the support toclean up those bank balance sheets, and we will assure the continuity of a strong and viable institution thatcan serve our people and our economy.Of course, there are some who differ with our approach. On the one hand, there are some who argue thatthe government should stand back and simply let these banks fail -- especially since in many cases it wastheir bad decisions that helped create the crisis in the first place. But whether we like it or not, history hasshown repeatedly that when nations do not take early and aggressive action to get credit flowing again, theyhave crises that last years and years instead of months and months -- years of low growth, years of low jobcreation, years of low investment, all of which cost these nations far more than a course of bold, upfrontaction.And although there are a lot of Americans who understandably think that government money would bebetter spent going directly to families and businesses instead of to banks -- one of my most frequentquestions in the letters that I get from constituents is, ""Where's my bailout?"" -- and I understand thesentiment. It makes sense intuitively, and morally it makes sense, but the truth is that a dollar of capital in abank can actually result in $8 or $10 of loans to families and businesses. So that's a multiplier effect thatcan ultimately lead to a faster pace of economic growth. That's why we have to fix the banks.Now, on the other hand, there have been some who don't dispute that we need to shore up the bankingsystem, but they suggest that we've been too timid in how we go about it. This is essentially thenationalization argument that some of you may have heard. And the argument says that the federalgovernment should have already preemptively stepped in and taken over major financial institutions the waythat the FDIC currently intervenes in smaller banks, and that our failure, my administration's failure to do sois yet another example of Washington coddling Wall Street -- ""Why aren't you tougher on the banks?""So let me be clear: The reason we have not taken this step has nothing to do with any ideological or politicaljudgment we've made about government involvement in banks. It's certainly not because of any concern wehave for the management and shareholders whose actions helped to cause this mess. Rather, it's becausewe believe that preemptive government takeovers are likely to end up costing taxpayers even more in theend, and because it's more likely to undermine than create confidence.Governments should practice the same principle as doctors: First, do no harm. So rest assured -- we will dowhatever is necessary to get credit flowing again, but we will do so in ways that minimize risks to taxpayersand to the broader economy. To that end, in addition to the program to provide capital to the banks, we'velaunched a plan that will pair government resources with private investment in order to clear away the oldloans and securities -- the so-called toxic assets -- that are also preventing our banks from lending money.Now, what we've also learned during this crisis is that our banks aren't the only institutions affected by thesetoxic assets that are clogging the financial system. AIG, for example, is not a bank, it's an insurancecompany, as I mentioned -- and yet because it chose to insure billions of dollars worth of risky assets,essentially creating a hedge fund on top of an insurance company, its failure could threaten the entirefinancial system and freeze lending even more. And that's why, as frustrating as it is -- and I promise you,nobody is more frustrated than me with AIG -- I promise -- we had to provide support for AIG, because theentire system, as fragile as it is, could be profoundly endangered if AIG went into a liquidation bankruptcy.It's also why we need new legal authority so that we have the power to intervene in such financialinstitutions, the same way that bankruptcy courts currently do with businesses that hit hard times but don'tpose systemic risks -- and that way we can restructure these businesses in an orderly way that doesn'tinduce panic in the financial system -- and, by the way, will allow us to restructure inappropriate bonuscontracts without creating a perception the government can just change compensation rules on a whim.This is also why we're moving aggressively to unfreeze markets and jumpstart lending outside the bankingsystem, where more than half of all lending in America actually takes place. To do this, we've started aprogram that will increase guarantees for small business loans and unlock the market for auto loans andstudent loans. And to stabilize the housing market, we've launched a plan that will save up to four millionresponsible homeowners from foreclosure and help many millions more to refinance their homes.In a few weeks, we will also reassess the state of Chrysler and General Motors, two companies with animportant place in our history and a large footprint in our economy -- but two companies that have also fallenon hard times.Late last year, the companies were given transitional loans by the previous administration to tide them overas they worked to develop viable business plans. Unfortunately, the plans they developed fell short, sowe've given them some additional time to work these complex issues through. And by the way, we owedthat not to the executives whose bad bets contributed to the weakening of their companies, but to thehundreds of thousands of workers whose livelihoods hang in the balance -- entire towns, entirecommunities, entire states are profoundly impacted by what happens in the auto industry.Now, it is our fervent hope that in the coming weeks, Chrysler will find a viable partner and GM will developa business plan that will put it on a path to profitability without endless support from American taxpayer. Inthe meantime, we're taking steps to spur demand for American cars and provide relief for autoworkers andtheir communities. And we will continue to reaffirm this nation's commitment to a 21st-century Americanauto industry that creates new jobs and builds the fuel-efficient cars and trucks that will carry us toward aclean-energy future.Finally, to coordinate a global response to this global recession, I went to the meeting of the G20 nations inLondon the other week. Each nation has undertaken significant stimulus to spur demand. All agreed topursue tougher regulatory reforms. We also agreed to triple the lending capacity of the InternationalMonetary Fund -- which, as many of you know, is an international financial institution supported by all themajor economies -- so that they can provide direct assistance to developing nations and vulnerablepopulations. That's not just charity; because America's success depends on whether other nations have theability to buy what we sell, it's important that we pay attention to these emerging markets.We pledged to avoid the trade barriers and protectionism that hurts us all in the end. And we decided tomeet again in the fall to gauge our progress and take additional steps if necessary.So that's where we've been, that's what we've done in the last three months. All of these actions -- theRecovery Act, the bank capitalization program, the housing plan, the strengthening of the non-bank creditmarket, the auto plan, and our work at the G20 -- all have been necessary pieces of the recovery puzzle.They've been designed to increase aggregate demand to get credit flowing again to families and businessesand to help families and businesses ride out the storm. And taken together, these actions are starting togenerate signs of economic progress.Because of our recovery plan, schools and police departments have cancelled planned layoffs; clean energycompanies and construction companies are re-hiring workers to build everything from energy-efficientwindows to new roads and highways. Our housing plan has helped lead to a spike in the number ofhomeowners who are taking advantage of historically-low mortgage rates by refinancing, which is likeputting a $2,000 tax cut in your pocket. Our program to support the market for auto loans and student loanshas started to unfreeze this market and securitize more of this lending in the last few weeks. And smallbusinesses are seeing a jump in loan activity for the first time in months.Now, this is all welcome and encouraging news. It does not mean the hard times are over; 2009 willcontinue to be a difficult year for America's economy, and obviously, most difficult for those who've lost theirjobs. The severity of this recession will cause more job loss, more foreclosures, and more pain before itends. The market will continue to rise and fall. Credit is still not flowing nearly as easily as it should. Theprocess for restructuring AIG and the auto companies will involve difficult and sometimes unpopularchoices; we are not finished yet on that front. And all of this means that there's much more work to be done.But all of this also means that you can continue to expect an unrelenting, unyielding, day-by-day effort fromthis administration to fight for economic recovery on all fronts.But even as we continue to clear away the wreckage and address the immediate crisis, it is my firm beliefthat our next task, beginning now, is to make sure such a crisis never happens again. Even as we clean upbalance sheets and get credit flowing again, even as people start spending and businesses start hiring -- allthat's going to happen -- we have to realize that we cannot go back to the bubble-and-bust economy that ledus to this point.It is simply not sustainable to have a 21st-century financial system that is governed by 20th-century rulesand regulations that allowed the recklessness of a few to threaten the entire economy. It is not sustainableto have an economy where in one year, 40 percent of our corporate profits came from a financial sector thatwas based on inflated home prices, maxed-out credit cards, over-leveraged banks and overvalued assets.It's not sustainable to have an economy where the incomes of the top 1 percent has skyrocketed while thetypical working household has seen their incomes decline by nearly $2,000. That's just not a sustainablemodel for long-term prosperity.For even as too many were out there chasing ever-bigger bonuses and short-term profits over the lastdecade, we continued to neglect the long-term threats to our prosperity: the crushing burden that the risingcost of health care is placing on families and businesses; the failure of our education system to prepare ourworkers for a new age; the progress that other nations are making on clean energy industries andtechnologies while we -- we remain addicted to foreign oil; the growing debt that we're passing on to ourchildren. Even after we emerge from the current recession, these challenges will still represent majorobstacles that stand in the way of our success in the 21st century. So we've got a lot of work to do.Now, there's a parable at the end of the Sermon on the Mount that tells the story of two men. The first builthis house on a pile of sand, and it was soon destroyed when a storm hit. But the second is known as thewise man, for when ""the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon thathouse, it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.""It was founded upon a rock. We cannot rebuild this economy on the same pile of sand. We must build ourhouse upon a rock. We must lay a new foundation for growth and prosperity -- a foundation that will moveus from an era of borrow and spend to one where we save and invest; where we consume less at home andsend more exports abroad.It's a foundation built upon five pillars that will grow our economy and make this new century anotherAmerican century: Number one, new rules for Wall Street that will reward drive and innovation, not recklessrisk-taking; number two, new investments in education that will make our workforce more skilled andcompetitive; number three, new investments in renewable energy and technology that will create new jobsand new industries; number four, new investments in health care that will cut costs for families andbusinesses; and number five, new savings in our federal budget that will bring down the debt for futuregenerations.That's the new foundation we must build. That's our house built upon a rock. That must be our future -- andmy administration's policies are designed to achieve that future.Let me talk about each of these steps in turn. The first step we will take to build this foundation is to reformthe outdated rules and regulations that allowed this crisis to happen in the first place. It is time to lay downtough new rules of the road for Wall Street to ensure that we never find ourselves here again. Just as afterthe Great Depression new rules were designed for banks to avoid the kind of reckless speculation thathelped to create the depression, so we've got to make adaptations to our current set of rules: create rulesthat punish shortcuts and abuse; rules that tie someone's pay to their actual job performance --- a novelconcept; rules that protect typical American families when they buy a home, get a credit card or invest in a401(k). So we've already begun to work with Congress to shape this comprehensive new regulatoryframework -- and I expect a bill to arrive on my desk for my signature before the year is out.The second pillar of this new foundation is an education system that finally prepares our workers for a 21stcentury economy. You know, in the 20th century, the G.I. Bill helped send a generation to college. Fordecades we led the world in educational attainment, and as a consequence we led the world in economicgrowth. But in this new economy, we've come to trail the world's leaders in graduation rates, in educationalachievement, in the production of scientists and engineers. That's why we have set a goal that will greatlyenhance our ability to compete for the high-wage, high-tech jobs of the 21st century: By 2020, America willonce again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world. That is the goal that we have setand we intend to do.To meet that goal, we have to start early. So we've already dramatically expanded early childhoodeducation. We are investing in innovative programs that have proven to help schools meet high standardsand close achievement gaps. We're creating new rewards that tie teachers' performance and new pathwaysfor advancement. And I've asked every American to commit to at least one year or more of higher educationor career training, and we have provided tax credits to make a college education more affordable for everyAmerican, even those who attend Georgetown.And, by the way, one of the changes that I would like to see -- and I'm going to be talking about this inweeks to come -- is once again seeing our best and our brightest commit themselves to making things --engineers, scientists, innovators. For so long, we have placed at the top of our pinnacle folks who canmanipulate numbers and engage in complex financial calculations. And that's good, we need some of that.But you know what we can really use is some more scientists and some more engineers, who are buildingand making things that we can export to other countries.Now, the third pillar of this new foundation is to harness the renewable energy that can create millions ofnew jobs and new industries. We all know that the country that harnesses this new energy source will leadthe 21st century. Yet we've allowed other countries to outpace us on this race to the future. I don't knowabout you, but I do not accept a future where the jobs and industries of tomorrow take root beyond ourborders. I think it's time for America to lead again.So the investments we made in the Recovery Act will double this nation's supply of renewable energy in thenext three years. And we are putting Americans to work making our homes and buildings more efficient sothat we can save billions on our energy bills and grow our economy at the same time.Now, the only though that we can truly spark the transformation that's need is through a gradual, market-based cap on carbon pollution, so that clean energy is the profitable kind of energy.There are those who've argued that we shouldn't attempt, we shouldn't even be thinking, we shouldn't evenbe talking about such a transition until the economy recovers. And they are right that we have to take intoaccount the costs of transition. Transitioning to a clean energy economy will not be easy. But we can nolonger delay putting a framework for a clean energy economy in place. That needs to be done now.If businesses and entrepreneurs know today that we are closing this carbon pollution loophole, they'll startinvesting in clean energy now. And pretty soon, we'll see more companies constructing solar panels, andworkers building wind turbines, and car companies manufacturing fuel-efficient cars. Investors will put somemoney into a new energy technology, and a small business will open to start selling it. That's how we cangrow this economy, enhance our security, and protect our planet at the same time.Now, the fourth pillar of our new foundation is a 21st century health care system where families, businessesand government budgets aren't dragged down by skyrocketing insurance premiums. One and a half millionAmericans could lose their homes this year just because of a medical crisis. Major American corporationsare struggling to compete with their foreign counterparts. Small businesses are closing their doors. We can'tallow the cost of health care to continue strangling our economy.And that's why our Recovery Act will invest in electronic health records with strict privacy standards that cansave money and lives and reduce medical error. That's why we've made the largest investment ever inpreventive care, because that's one of the best ways to keep costs under control. And included in thebudgets that just passed Congress is an historic commitment to reform that will finally make quality healthcare affordable for every American. So I'm looking forward in the next few months to working with bothparties in Congress to make this reform a reality. We can get this done -- and we have to get it done.Now, fixing our health care system will -- will require resources; it's not going to be free. But in my budgetwe've made a commitment to fully pay for reform without increasing the deficit, and we've identified specificsavings that will make the health care system more efficient and reduce costs for us all.In fact, we've undertaken an unprecedented effort to find this kind of savings in every corner of the budget,because the final pillar in building our new foundation is restoring fiscal discipline once this economyrecovers.Already we've identified $2 trillion dollars in deficit reductions over the next decade. We need to do more,but we've already done that. We've announced procurement reform that will greatly reduce no-bid contractsand save the government $40 billion. We need to do more, but that's an important start. Secretary Gatesrecently announced a courageous set of reforms that go right at the hundreds of billions of dollars in wasteand cost overruns that have bloated our defense budget without making America safer. We need to domore, but that proposal by Secretary Gates is right on target. We will end education programs that don'twork, we will root out waste and fraud and abuse in our Medicare program.Altogether, this budget will reduce discretionary spending for domestic programs as a share of the economyby more than 10 percent over the next decade to the lowest level we've seen since we began keepingrecords nearly half a century ago. And as we continue to go through the federal budget line by line, we willbe announcing additional savings, secured by eliminating and consolidating programs that we don't need sowe can make room for the things that we do need.That's what we're doing now. Of course, I realize that for some, this isn't enough. I know there's a criticismout there that my administration has been spending with reckless abandon, pushing a liberal social agendawhile mortgaging our children's future. You've heard the argument.Well, let me make three points. First, as I said earlier, the worst thing that we could do in a recession thissevere is to try to cut government spending at the same time as families and businesses around the worldare cutting back on their spending. So as serious as our deficit and debt problems are -- and they are veryserious -- major efforts to deal with them have to focus on the medium and long-term budget picture, not onthe short-term. And that's exactly what we've done.Second, in tackling the deficit issue, we simply cannot sacrifice the long-term investments that we sodesperately need to generate long-term prosperity. That's the argument that some critics have made: Well,you're proposing health care reform, you shouldn't be doing that; you're proposing education investments,you shouldn't be doing that, that adds to the deficit.Look, just as a cash-strapped family may cut back on all kinds of luxuries, but will still insist on spendingmoney to get their children through college, will refuse to have their kids drop out of college and go to workin some fast-food place, even though that might bring in some income in the short-term, because they'rethinking about the long term -- so we as a country have to make current choices with an eye for the future.If we don't invest now in renewable energy, if we don't invest now in a skilled workforce, if we don't investnow in a more affordable health care system, this economy simply won't grow at the pace it needs to in twoor five or 10 years down the road. If we don't lay this new foundation now, it won't be long before we're rightback where we are today. And I can assure you that chronically slow growth will not help our long-termbudget situation. That's the second point.Third point, the problem with our deficit and debt is not new. It has been building dramatically over the pasteight years, largely because big tax cuts combined with increased spending on two wars and the increasedcosts of government health care programs have pushed it ever upwards. This structural gap in our budget,between the amount of money that's coming in and the amount of money that's going out, will only getworse as the baby boomers age, and will in fact lead us down an unsustainable path.But let's not kid ourselves and suggest that we can solve this problem by trimming a few earmarks or cuttingthe budget for the National Endowment for the Arts. That's just not true. Along with defense and interest onthe national debt, the biggest cost drivers in our budget are entitlement programs like Medicare, Medicaid,and Social Security -- all of which get more and more expensive every year. So if we want to get seriousabout fiscal discipline, and I do, then we're going to not only have to trim waste out of our discretionarybudget -- which we've already begun -- we will also have to get serious about entitlement reform.Now, nothing will be more important to this goal than passing health care reform that brings down costsacross the system, including in Medicare and Medicaid. So make no mistake, health care reform isentitlement reform. That's not just my opinion -- that was the conclusion of a wide range of participants atthe Fiscal Responsibility Summit that we held at the White House in February. And that's one of the reasonswhy I firmly believe we need to get health care reform done this year.Once we tackle rising health care costs, we must also work to put Social Security on firmer footing. It's timefor both parties to come together and find a way to keep the promise of a sound retirement for futuregenerations. And we should restore a sense of fairness and balance to our tax code including by shuttingdown corporate loopholes and ensuring that everyone pays what they owe.All of these efforts will require tough choices. All these efforts will require compromise. But the difficultiescan't serve as an excuse for inaction -- not anymore -- which brings me to one final point I'd like to maketoday. I've talked a lot about the fundamental weakness in our economy that led us to this day of reckoning.But we also arrived here because of a fundamental weakness in our political system.For too long, too many in Washington put off hard decisions for some other time on some other day. There'sbeen a tendency to spend a lot of time scoring political points instead of rolling up sleeves to solve realproblems.There's also an impatience that characterizes this town -- an attention span that has only grown shorter withthe 24-hour news cycle that insists on instant gratification in the form of immediate results or higher pollnumbers. When a crisis hits, there's all too often a lurch from shock to trance, with everyone responding tothe tempest of the moment until the furor has died down, the media coverage has moved on to somethingelse, instead of confronting the major challenges that will shape our future in a sustained and focused way.This can't be one of those times. The challenges are too great. The stakes are too high. I know how difficultit is for members of Congress in both parties to grapple with some of the big decisions we face right now. I'dlove if these problems were coming at us one at a time instead of five or six at a time. It's more than mostCongresses and most Presidents have to deal with in a lifetime.But we have been called to govern in extraordinary times. And that requires an extraordinary sense ofresponsibility -- to ourselves, to the men and women who sent us here, to the many generations whose liveswill be affected for good or for ill because of what we do here.There is no doubt that times are still tough. By no means are we out of the woods just yet. But from wherewe stand, for the very first time, we're beginning to see glimmers of hope. And beyond that, way off in thedistance, we can see a vision of an America's future that is far different than our troubled economic past. It'san America teeming with new industry and commerce, humming with new energy and discoveries that lightthe world once more -- a place where anyone from anywhere with a good idea or the will to work can live thedream they've heard so much about.That is the house upon the rock -- proud, sturdy, unwavering in the face of the greatest storms. And we willnot finish it in one year. We will not finish it in many. But if we use this moment to lay that new foundation, ifwe come together and begin the hard work of rebuilding, if we persist and persevere against thedisappointments and setbacks that will surely lie ahead, then I have no doubt that this house will stand andthe dream of our founders will live on in our time.Thank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.",obama
"Thank you for the extraordinary welcome. And thanks for those of you who prepared, fromthe CIA gift shop, the t-shirts, the caps, the water bottles.  Michelle and the girls willappreciate that very much. It is a great honor to be here with the men and women of the CIA. Ive been eager to comeout here to Langley for some time so I can deliver a simple message to you in person onbehalf of the American people: Thank you. Thank you for all the work that you do to protectthe American people and the freedom that we all cherish.The CIA is fundamental to Americas national security. And I want you to know that thats whyI nominated such an outstanding public servant and close friend, Leon Panetta, to lead -- tolead the agency. He is one of our nations finest public servants. He has my completeconfidence. And he is a strong voice in my national security team, as well as a strongadvocate for the men and women of the CIA.I also benefit from the counsel of several agency veterans -- chief among them, SteveKappes, whos stayed on to serve as Leons deputy. Hes -- and hes done outstanding work.I have to add, just as an aside, by the way, I just met with a smaller group of about 50, so wecould have a dialogue. And all of you look really young.  And so to have a graybeard literallyand figuratively like Steve Kappes here, I think, is absolutely critical.I also want you to know that we have one of your own, John Brennan, who is doing a terrificjob as my adviser for counterterrorism and homeland security. And we are very grateful forthe work that he does and the insights that he brings, from his long years of service here atthe CIA.And I would be remiss if I didnt mention the extraordinary former CIA officer and Director ofCentral Intelligence, Bob Gates, who is also part of our Cabinet and every once in a whilegives me a few tips. So let me share with you just a few thoughts about the situation in which we find ourselves.First, I want to underscore the importance of the CIA. When the CIA was founded, you werefocused on one overarching threat, the Soviet Union. And for decades, the CIA carried out acritically important mission. And with the end of the Cold War, some wondered how importantthe CIA would be to our future. Now we know.Here in the 21st century, weve learned that the CIA is more important than ever. For as Leonmentioned, we face a wide range of unconventional challenges: stateless terrorist networkslike al-Qaeda, the spread of catastrophic weapons, cyberthreats, failed states, rogue regimes,persistent conflict. And now we have to add to our list piracy.The CIA is unique in the capabilities of collection, analysis and operation that you bring tobear. So you are an indispensable tool, the tip of the spear in Americas intelligence missionand our national security.It is because of you that I can make good decisions. You prove that the key to goodintelligence is not simply technology. Its the quality of the men and women who have signedup to serve.Youre on the front lines against unconventional challenges.You help us understand the world as it is. You support the work of our troops and ourdiplomats and law enforcement officers. You disrupt terrorist plots, and youre critical to ourefforts to destroy terrorist networks. You serve capably, courageously, and from here inVirginia to dangerous outposts around the globe, you make enormous sacrifices on our behalf.So you should be proud of what you do.Second, you need to know that youve got my full support. For decades, the American peoplehave counted on you to protect them. I know that Ive come to personally count on yourservices. I rely on your reporting and your analysis, which finds its way onto my desk everysingle day.And I know youve got a tough job. I know theres no margin for error. And I know there areendless demands for intelligence. There is an urgent necessity to collect and analyzeinformation and to work seamlessly with other agencies to act on it.And -- And what makes it tougher is when you succeed, as you so often do, that successusually has to stay secret. So you dont get credit when things go good, but you sure getsome blame when things dont.Audience Member: [Words indistinct.]President Obama: Now -- I got an amen corner out there.Now, in that context, I know that the last few days have been difficult.As I made clear, in releasing the OLC memos as a consequence of a court case that waspending and to which it was very difficult for us to mount an effective legal defense, I actedprimarily because of the exceptional circumstances that surrounded these memos, particularlythe fact that so much of the information was public -- had been publicly acknowledged. Thecovert nature of the information had been compromised.I have fought to protect the integrity of classified information in the past, and I will do so inthe future. And there is nothing more important than protecting the identities of CIA officers.So I need everybody to be clear: we will protect your identities and your security as youvigorously pursue your missions. I will be as vigorous in protecting you as you are vigorous inprotecting the American people.Now, I have put an end to the interrogation techniques described in those OLC memos. And Iwant to -- I want to be very clear and very blunt. Ive done so for a simple reason: because Ibelieve that our nation is stronger and more secure when we deploy the full measure of bothour power and the power of our values, including the rule of law. I know I can count on you todo exactly that.You know, there have been some conversations that Ive had with senior folks here at Langleyin which I think people have expressed understandable anxiety and concern. So I -- I -- Iwant to make a point that I just made in the smaller group. I understand that its hard whenyou are asked to protect the American people against people who have no scruples and wouldwillingly and gladly kill innocents.Al-Qaedas not constrained by a constitution. Many of our adversaries are not constrained by abelief in freedom of speech or representation in court or rule of law. So Im sure thatsometimes it seems as if that means were operating with one hand tied behind our back orthat those who would argue for a higher standard are naive. I understand that. You know, Ive-- I watch the cable shows once in a while.What makes the United States special, and what makes you special, is precisely the fact thatwe are willing to uphold our values and ideals even when its hard -- not just when its easy;even when we are afraid and under threat -- not just when its expedient to do so. Thats whatmakes us different.So yes, youve got a harder job. And so do I. And thats okay, because thats why we can takesuch extraordinary pride in being Americans.  And over the long term, that is why I believe wewill defeat our enemies: because were on the better side of history.So dont be discouraged by whats happened in the last few weeks. Dont be discouraged thatwe have to acknowledge potentially weve made some mistakes. Thats how we learn.But the fact that we are willing to acknowledge them and then move forward, that is preciselywhy I am proud to be President of the United States, and thats why you should be proud tobe members of the CIA. All right?Third point -- Third point -- I want you to know how much the American people appreciateyour service. Sometimes its hard to acknowledge sacrifices made by the people whose work,or even identity, must remain secret, and thats part of the enormous burden that you carrywhen you sign up. But you make the extraordinary sacrifice of giving up parts of your life inservice to your country. Many of you take long deployments overseas. You miss seeing yourfamilies; you miss weekend barbecues and the birthday parties, watching your children growup. You cant even exchange in the simplest pleasures of talking about your job -- orcomplaining about your job openly.There are few signs of patriotism more powerful than offering to serve out of the limelight,and so many of you have signed up to serve after 9/11 -- thats partly why youre all so young-- fully aware of the dangers before you. You serve courageously, but your courage is onlyknown to a few. You accomplish remarkable things, but the credit you receive is the privateknowledge that youve done something to secure this country. Thats a sacrifice thats carvedinto those marble walls. Those 89 stars stand as a testament to both the men and women ofthe CIA who gave their lives in service to their country, and to all who dedicate themselves tothe mission of this agency.Now we must look forward to the future with confidence. All that youve achieved, I believethat the CIAs best days are still yet to come. And you will have my support and appreciationas you carry on this critical work.We live in dangerous times. I am going to need you more than ever, precisely because wereseeing changes in our foreign policy, and we want to send a new message to the world. Thatrequires better intelligence, not less of it. That means that were going to have to operatesmarter and more effectively than ever. So Im going to be relying on you, and the Americanpeople are going to rely on you. And I hope that you will continue to take extraordinary pridein the challenges that come with the job.Thank you very much. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America.",obama
"Well, to President DeGioia, thank you so much for the gracious introduction, and thanks for bringing yourfamily -- including JT -- appreciate you. We're going to invite him over, hang out with the girls. He's a prettygood-looking young man.To Mayor Adrian Fenty, who's doing such a great job in this city, thank you so much for your attendance. ToRepresentative Donna Edwards, who is here and represents Maryland's 4th District, thank you.To Georgetown University students, it is great to be here. Well, it is good to be back. I appeared in this roomduring the campaign and had a wonderful reception then, and it's wonderful to be back and be with all ofyou.We're going to talk about the economy today. And I was telling President DeGioia this may be a slightlylonger speech than I usually give, but it's a slightly bigger topic, and that is how we are going to deal with somany of our economic challenges.You know, it's been 12 weeks now since my administration began. And I think that even our critics wouldagree that at the very least, we've been busy. In just under three months, we've responded to anextraordinary set of economic challenges with extraordinary action -- action that's been unprecedented bothin terms of its scale and its speed.And I know that some have accused us of taking on too much at once. Others believe we haven't doneenough. And many Americans are simply wondering how all of our different programs and policies fittogether in a single, overarching strategy that will move this economy from recession to recovery andultimately to prosperity.So today, I want to step back for a moment and explain our strategy as clearly as I can. This is going to beprose, and not poetry. I want to talk about what we've done, why we've done it, and what we have left to do.I want to update you on the progress we've made, but I also want to be honest about the pitfalls that maystill lie ahead.Most of all, I want every American to know that each action we take and each policy we pursue is driven bya larger vision of America's future -- a future where sustained economic growth creates good jobs and risingincomes; a future where prosperity is fueled not by excessive debt, or reckless speculation, or fleetingprofits, but is instead built by skilled, productive workers, by sound investments that will spread opportunityat home and allow this nation to lead the world in the technologies and the innovation and discoveries thatwill shape the 21st century. That's the America I see. That's the America that Georgetown is preparing somany of you for. That is the future that I know that we can have.Now, to understand how we get there, we first need to understand how we got here.Recessions are not uncommon. Markets and economies naturally ebb and flow, as we've seen many timesin our history. But this recession is different. This recession was not caused by a normal downturn in thebusiness cycle. It was caused by a perfect storm of irresponsibility and poor decision-making that stretchedfrom Wall Street to Washington to Main Street.As has been widely reported, it started in the housing market. During the course of the decade, the formulafor buying a house changed: Instead of saving their pennies to buy their dream house, many Americansfound that suddenly they could take out loans that by traditional standards their incomes just could notsupport. Others were tricked into signing these subprime loans by lenders who were trying to make a quickprofit. The reason these loans were so readily available was that Wall Street saw big profits to be made.Investment banks would buy and package together these questionable mortgages into securities, arguingthat by pooling the mortgages the risks had somehow been reduced. And credit agencies that are supposedto help investors determine the soundness of various investments stamped the securities with their safestrating when they should have been labeled ""Buyer Beware.""No one really knew what the actual value of these securities were, no one fully understood what the riskswere. But since the housing market was booming and prices were rising, banks and investors just keptbuying and selling them, always passing off the risk to someone else for a greater profit without having totake any of the ultimate responsibility. Banks took on more debt than they could handle.The government-chartered companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, whose traditional mandate was to helpsupport traditional mortgages, decided to get in on the action by buying and holding billions of dollars ofthese securities. AIG, the biggest insurer in the world that had a very traditional insurance business that wasvery profitable, decided to make profits suddenly by selling billions of dollars of complicated financialinstruments that supposedly insured these securities. Everybody was making record profits -- except thewealth created was real only on paper. And as the bubble grew, there was almost no accountability oroversight from anyone in Washington.Then the housing bubble burst. Home prices fell. People began to default on their subprime mortgages. Andthe value of all those loans and securities plummeted. Banks and investors couldn't find anyone to buythem. Greed gave way to fear. Investors pulled their money out of the market. Large financial institutionsthat didn't have enough money on hand to pay off all their obligations collapsed. Other banks held on tight totheir money and simply stopped lending.Now, this is when the crisis spread from Wall Street to Main Street. After all, the ability to get a loan is howyou finance the purchase of everything from a home to a car to, as you all know very well, a collegeeducation. It's how stores stock their shelves, and farms buy equipment, and businesses make payroll. Sowhen banks stopped lending money, businesses started laying off workers. When laid-off workers had lessmoney to spend, businesses were forced to lay off even more workers. When people couldn't get a car loan,a bad situation at the auto companies became even worse. When people couldn't get home loans, the crisisin the housing market only deepened. Because the infected securities were being traded worldwide andother nations also had weak regulations, this recession soon became global. And when other nations can'tafford to buy our goods, it slows our economy even further.So this is the situation, the downward spiral that we confronted on the day that we took office. So our mosturgent task has been to clear away the wreckage, repair the immediate damage to the economy, and doeverything we can to prevent a larger collapse. And since the problems we face are all working off eachother to feed a vicious economic downturn, we've had no choice but to attack all fronts of our economiccrisis simultaneously.The first step was to fight a severe shortage of demand in the economy. So the Federal Reserve did this bydramatically lowering interest rates last year in order to boost investment. My administration and Congressboosted demand by passing the largest recovery plan in our nation's history. It's a plan that's already in theprocess of saving or creating 3.5 million jobs over the next two years. It's putting money directly intopeople's pockets with a tax cut for 95 percent of working families that's now showing up in paychecks acrossAmerica. And to cushion the blow of this recession, we also provided extended unemployment benefits andcontinued health care coverage to Americans who've lost their jobs through no fault of their own.Now, you will recall that some argued this recovery plan is a case of irresponsible government spending,that it's somehow to blame for our long-term deficit projections, and that the federal government should becutting instead of increasing spending right now. So I want to tackle this argument head on.To begin with, economists on both the left and the right agree that the last thing a government should do inthe middle of a recession is to cut back on spending. You see, when this recession began, many families sataround the kitchen table and tried to figure out where they could cut back. And so have many businesses.And this is a completely reasonable and understandable reaction. But if everybody -- if everybody -- if everyfamily in America, if every business in America cuts back all at once, then no one is spending any money,which means there are no customers, which means there are more layoffs, which means the economy getseven worse. That's why the government has to step in and temporarily boost spending in order to stimulatedemand. That's exactly what we're doing right now.Second, I absolutely agree that our long-term deficit is a major problem that we have to fix. But the fact isthat this recovery plan represents only a tiny fraction of that long-term deficit. As I'll discuss in a moment, thekey to dealing with our long-term deficit and our national debt is to get a handle on out-of-control health carecosts -- not to stand idly by as the economy goes into free fall.So the recovery plan has been the first step in confronting this economic crisis. The second step has beento heal our financial system so that credit is once again flowing to the businesses and families who rely on it.The heart of this financial crisis is that too many banks and other financial institutions simply stoppedlending money. In a climate of fear, banks were unable to replace their losses from some of those badmortgages by raising new capital on their own, and they were unwilling to lend the money they did havebecause they were afraid that no one would pay it back. It's for this reason that the last administration usedwhat they called the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, to provide these banks with temporaryfinancial assistance in order to get them lending again.Now, I understand that TARP is not popular, and I have to say that I don't agree with some of the ways theTARP program was managed, but I do agree with the broader rationale that we must provide banks with thecapital and the confidence necessary to start lending again. That's the purpose of the stress tests that willsoon tell us how much additional capital will be needed to support lending at our largest banks. Ideally,these needs will be met by private investors who are willing to put in money to these banks. But where that'snot possible, and banks require substantial additional resources from the government, then we will holdaccountable those who are responsible, we'll force the necessary adjustments, we'll provide the support toclean up those bank balance sheets, and we will assure the continuity of a strong and viable institution thatcan serve our people and our economy.Of course, there are some who differ with our approach. On the one hand, there are some who argue thatthe government should stand back and simply let these banks fail -- especially since in many cases it wastheir bad decisions that helped create the crisis in the first place. But whether we like it or not, history hasshown repeatedly that when nations do not take early and aggressive action to get credit flowing again, theyhave crises that last years and years instead of months and months -- years of low growth, years of low jobcreation, years of low investment, all of which cost these nations far more than a course of bold, upfrontaction.And although there are a lot of Americans who understandably think that government money would bebetter spent going directly to families and businesses instead of to banks -- one of my most frequentquestions in the letters that I get from constituents is, ""Where's my bailout?"" -- and I understand thesentiment. It makes sense intuitively, and morally it makes sense, but the truth is that a dollar of capital in abank can actually result in $8 or $10 of loans to families and businesses. So that's a multiplier effect thatcan ultimately lead to a faster pace of economic growth. That's why we have to fix the banks.Now, on the other hand, there have been some who don't dispute that we need to shore up the bankingsystem, but they suggest that we've been too timid in how we go about it. This is essentially thenationalization argument that some of you may have heard. And the argument says that the federalgovernment should have already preemptively stepped in and taken over major financial institutions the waythat the FDIC currently intervenes in smaller banks, and that our failure, my administration's failure to do sois yet another example of Washington coddling Wall Street -- ""Why aren't you tougher on the banks?""So let me be clear: The reason we have not taken this step has nothing to do with any ideological or politicaljudgment we've made about government involvement in banks. It's certainly not because of any concern wehave for the management and shareholders whose actions helped to cause this mess. Rather, it's becausewe believe that preemptive government takeovers are likely to end up costing taxpayers even more in theend, and because it's more likely to undermine than create confidence.Governments should practice the same principle as doctors: First, do no harm. So rest assured -- we will dowhatever is necessary to get credit flowing again, but we will do so in ways that minimize risks to taxpayersand to the broader economy. To that end, in addition to the program to provide capital to the banks, we'velaunched a plan that will pair government resources with private investment in order to clear away the oldloans and securities -- the so-called toxic assets -- that are also preventing our banks from lending money.Now, what we've also learned during this crisis is that our banks aren't the only institutions affected by thesetoxic assets that are clogging the financial system. AIG, for example, is not a bank, it's an insurancecompany, as I mentioned -- and yet because it chose to insure billions of dollars worth of risky assets,essentially creating a hedge fund on top of an insurance company, its failure could threaten the entirefinancial system and freeze lending even more. And that's why, as frustrating as it is -- and I promise you,nobody is more frustrated than me with AIG -- I promise -- we had to provide support for AIG, because theentire system, as fragile as it is, could be profoundly endangered if AIG went into a liquidation bankruptcy.It's also why we need new legal authority so that we have the power to intervene in such financialinstitutions, the same way that bankruptcy courts currently do with businesses that hit hard times but don'tpose systemic risks -- and that way we can restructure these businesses in an orderly way that doesn'tinduce panic in the financial system -- and, by the way, will allow us to restructure inappropriate bonuscontracts without creating a perception the government can just change compensation rules on a whim.This is also why we're moving aggressively to unfreeze markets and jumpstart lending outside the bankingsystem, where more than half of all lending in America actually takes place. To do this, we've started aprogram that will increase guarantees for small business loans and unlock the market for auto loans andstudent loans. And to stabilize the housing market, we've launched a plan that will save up to four millionresponsible homeowners from foreclosure and help many millions more to refinance their homes.In a few weeks, we will also reassess the state of Chrysler and General Motors, two companies with animportant place in our history and a large footprint in our economy -- but two companies that have also fallenon hard times.Late last year, the companies were given transitional loans by the previous administration to tide them overas they worked to develop viable business plans. Unfortunately, the plans they developed fell short, sowe've given them some additional time to work these complex issues through. And by the way, we owedthat not to the executives whose bad bets contributed to the weakening of their companies, but to thehundreds of thousands of workers whose livelihoods hang in the balance -- entire towns, entirecommunities, entire states are profoundly impacted by what happens in the auto industry.Now, it is our fervent hope that in the coming weeks, Chrysler will find a viable partner and GM will developa business plan that will put it on a path to profitability without endless support from American taxpayer. Inthe meantime, we're taking steps to spur demand for American cars and provide relief for autoworkers andtheir communities. And we will continue to reaffirm this nation's commitment to a 21st-century Americanauto industry that creates new jobs and builds the fuel-efficient cars and trucks that will carry us toward aclean-energy future.Finally, to coordinate a global response to this global recession, I went to the meeting of the G20 nations inLondon the other week. Each nation has undertaken significant stimulus to spur demand. All agreed topursue tougher regulatory reforms. We also agreed to triple the lending capacity of the InternationalMonetary Fund -- which, as many of you know, is an international financial institution supported by all themajor economies -- so that they can provide direct assistance to developing nations and vulnerablepopulations. That's not just charity; because America's success depends on whether other nations have theability to buy what we sell, it's important that we pay attention to these emerging markets.We pledged to avoid the trade barriers and protectionism that hurts us all in the end. And we decided tomeet again in the fall to gauge our progress and take additional steps if necessary.So that's where we've been, that's what we've done in the last three months. All of these actions -- theRecovery Act, the bank capitalization program, the housing plan, the strengthening of the non-bank creditmarket, the auto plan, and our work at the G20 -- all have been necessary pieces of the recovery puzzle.They've been designed to increase aggregate demand to get credit flowing again to families and businessesand to help families and businesses ride out the storm. And taken together, these actions are starting togenerate signs of economic progress.Because of our recovery plan, schools and police departments have cancelled planned layoffs; clean energycompanies and construction companies are re-hiring workers to build everything from energy-efficientwindows to new roads and highways. Our housing plan has helped lead to a spike in the number ofhomeowners who are taking advantage of historically-low mortgage rates by refinancing, which is likeputting a $2,000 tax cut in your pocket. Our program to support the market for auto loans and student loanshas started to unfreeze this market and securitize more of this lending in the last few weeks. And smallbusinesses are seeing a jump in loan activity for the first time in months.Now, this is all welcome and encouraging news. It does not mean the hard times are over; 2009 willcontinue to be a difficult year for America's economy, and obviously, most difficult for those who've lost theirjobs. The severity of this recession will cause more job loss, more foreclosures, and more pain before itends. The market will continue to rise and fall. Credit is still not flowing nearly as easily as it should. Theprocess for restructuring AIG and the auto companies will involve difficult and sometimes unpopularchoices; we are not finished yet on that front. And all of this means that there's much more work to be done.But all of this also means that you can continue to expect an unrelenting, unyielding, day-by-day effort fromthis administration to fight for economic recovery on all fronts.But even as we continue to clear away the wreckage and address the immediate crisis, it is my firm beliefthat our next task, beginning now, is to make sure such a crisis never happens again. Even as we clean upbalance sheets and get credit flowing again, even as people start spending and businesses start hiring -- allthat's going to happen -- we have to realize that we cannot go back to the bubble-and-bust economy that ledus to this point.It is simply not sustainable to have a 21st-century financial system that is governed by 20th-century rulesand regulations that allowed the recklessness of a few to threaten the entire economy. It is not sustainableto have an economy where in one year, 40 percent of our corporate profits came from a financial sector thatwas based on inflated home prices, maxed-out credit cards, over-leveraged banks and overvalued assets.It's not sustainable to have an economy where the incomes of the top 1 percent has skyrocketed while thetypical working household has seen their incomes decline by nearly $2,000. That's just not a sustainablemodel for long-term prosperity.For even as too many were out there chasing ever-bigger bonuses and short-term profits over the lastdecade, we continued to neglect the long-term threats to our prosperity: the crushing burden that the risingcost of health care is placing on families and businesses; the failure of our education system to prepare ourworkers for a new age; the progress that other nations are making on clean energy industries andtechnologies while we -- we remain addicted to foreign oil; the growing debt that we're passing on to ourchildren. Even after we emerge from the current recession, these challenges will still represent majorobstacles that stand in the way of our success in the 21st century. So we've got a lot of work to do.Now, there's a parable at the end of the Sermon on the Mount that tells the story of two men. The first builthis house on a pile of sand, and it was soon destroyed when a storm hit. But the second is known as thewise man, for when ""the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon thathouse, it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.""It was founded upon a rock. We cannot rebuild this economy on the same pile of sand. We must build ourhouse upon a rock. We must lay a new foundation for growth and prosperity -- a foundation that will moveus from an era of borrow and spend to one where we save and invest; where we consume less at home andsend more exports abroad.It's a foundation built upon five pillars that will grow our economy and make this new century anotherAmerican century: Number one, new rules for Wall Street that will reward drive and innovation, not recklessrisk-taking; number two, new investments in education that will make our workforce more skilled andcompetitive; number three, new investments in renewable energy and technology that will create new jobsand new industries; number four, new investments in health care that will cut costs for families andbusinesses; and number five, new savings in our federal budget that will bring down the debt for futuregenerations.That's the new foundation we must build. That's our house built upon a rock. That must be our future -- andmy administration's policies are designed to achieve that future.Let me talk about each of these steps in turn. The first step we will take to build this foundation is to reformthe outdated rules and regulations that allowed this crisis to happen in the first place. It is time to lay downtough new rules of the road for Wall Street to ensure that we never find ourselves here again. Just as afterthe Great Depression new rules were designed for banks to avoid the kind of reckless speculation thathelped to create the depression, so we've got to make adaptations to our current set of rules: create rulesthat punish shortcuts and abuse; rules that tie someone's pay to their actual job performance --- a novelconcept; rules that protect typical American families when they buy a home, get a credit card or invest in a401(k). So we've already begun to work with Congress to shape this comprehensive new regulatoryframework -- and I expect a bill to arrive on my desk for my signature before the year is out.The second pillar of this new foundation is an education system that finally prepares our workers for a 21stcentury economy. You know, in the 20th century, the G.I. Bill helped send a generation to college. Fordecades we led the world in educational attainment, and as a consequence we led the world in economicgrowth. But in this new economy, we've come to trail the world's leaders in graduation rates, in educationalachievement, in the production of scientists and engineers. That's why we have set a goal that will greatlyenhance our ability to compete for the high-wage, high-tech jobs of the 21st century: By 2020, America willonce again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world. That is the goal that we have setand we intend to do.To meet that goal, we have to start early. So we've already dramatically expanded early childhoodeducation. We are investing in innovative programs that have proven to help schools meet high standardsand close achievement gaps. We're creating new rewards that tie teachers' performance and new pathwaysfor advancement. And I've asked every American to commit to at least one year or more of higher educationor career training, and we have provided tax credits to make a college education more affordable for everyAmerican, even those who attend Georgetown.And, by the way, one of the changes that I would like to see -- and I'm going to be talking about this inweeks to come -- is once again seeing our best and our brightest commit themselves to making things --engineers, scientists, innovators. For so long, we have placed at the top of our pinnacle folks who canmanipulate numbers and engage in complex financial calculations. And that's good, we need some of that.But you know what we can really use is some more scientists and some more engineers, who are buildingand making things that we can export to other countries.Now, the third pillar of this new foundation is to harness the renewable energy that can create millions ofnew jobs and new industries. We all know that the country that harnesses this new energy source will leadthe 21st century. Yet we've allowed other countries to outpace us on this race to the future. I don't knowabout you, but I do not accept a future where the jobs and industries of tomorrow take root beyond ourborders. I think it's time for America to lead again.So the investments we made in the Recovery Act will double this nation's supply of renewable energy in thenext three years. And we are putting Americans to work making our homes and buildings more efficient sothat we can save billions on our energy bills and grow our economy at the same time.Now, the only though that we can truly spark the transformation that's need is through a gradual, market-based cap on carbon pollution, so that clean energy is the profitable kind of energy.There are those who've argued that we shouldn't attempt, we shouldn't even be thinking, we shouldn't evenbe talking about such a transition until the economy recovers. And they are right that we have to take intoaccount the costs of transition. Transitioning to a clean energy economy will not be easy. But we can nolonger delay putting a framework for a clean energy economy in place. That needs to be done now.If businesses and entrepreneurs know today that we are closing this carbon pollution loophole, they'll startinvesting in clean energy now. And pretty soon, we'll see more companies constructing solar panels, andworkers building wind turbines, and car companies manufacturing fuel-efficient cars. Investors will put somemoney into a new energy technology, and a small business will open to start selling it. That's how we cangrow this economy, enhance our security, and protect our planet at the same time.Now, the fourth pillar of our new foundation is a 21st century health care system where families, businessesand government budgets aren't dragged down by skyrocketing insurance premiums. One and a half millionAmericans could lose their homes this year just because of a medical crisis. Major American corporationsare struggling to compete with their foreign counterparts. Small businesses are closing their doors. We can'tallow the cost of health care to continue strangling our economy.And that's why our Recovery Act will invest in electronic health records with strict privacy standards that cansave money and lives and reduce medical error. That's why we've made the largest investment ever inpreventive care, because that's one of the best ways to keep costs under control. And included in thebudgets that just passed Congress is an historic commitment to reform that will finally make quality healthcare affordable for every American. So I'm looking forward in the next few months to working with bothparties in Congress to make this reform a reality. We can get this done -- and we have to get it done.Now, fixing our health care system will -- will require resources; it's not going to be free. But in my budgetwe've made a commitment to fully pay for reform without increasing the deficit, and we've identified specificsavings that will make the health care system more efficient and reduce costs for us all.In fact, we've undertaken an unprecedented effort to find this kind of savings in every corner of the budget,because the final pillar in building our new foundation is restoring fiscal discipline once this economyrecovers.Already we've identified $2 trillion dollars in deficit reductions over the next decade. We need to do more,but we've already done that. We've announced procurement reform that will greatly reduce no-bid contractsand save the government $40 billion. We need to do more, but that's an important start. Secretary Gatesrecently announced a courageous set of reforms that go right at the hundreds of billions of dollars in wasteand cost overruns that have bloated our defense budget without making America safer. We need to domore, but that proposal by Secretary Gates is right on target. We will end education programs that don'twork, we will root out waste and fraud and abuse in our Medicare program.Altogether, this budget will reduce discretionary spending for domestic programs as a share of the economyby more than 10 percent over the next decade to the lowest level we've seen since we began keepingrecords nearly half a century ago. And as we continue to go through the federal budget line by line, we willbe announcing additional savings, secured by eliminating and consolidating programs that we don't need sowe can make room for the things that we do need.That's what we're doing now. Of course, I realize that for some, this isn't enough. I know there's a criticismout there that my administration has been spending with reckless abandon, pushing a liberal social agendawhile mortgaging our children's future. You've heard the argument.Well, let me make three points. First, as I said earlier, the worst thing that we could do in a recession thissevere is to try to cut government spending at the same time as families and businesses around the worldare cutting back on their spending. So as serious as our deficit and debt problems are -- and they are veryserious -- major efforts to deal with them have to focus on the medium and long-term budget picture, not onthe short-term. And that's exactly what we've done.Second, in tackling the deficit issue, we simply cannot sacrifice the long-term investments that we sodesperately need to generate long-term prosperity. That's the argument that some critics have made: Well,you're proposing health care reform, you shouldn't be doing that; you're proposing education investments,you shouldn't be doing that, that adds to the deficit.Look, just as a cash-strapped family may cut back on all kinds of luxuries, but will still insist on spendingmoney to get their children through college, will refuse to have their kids drop out of college and go to workin some fast-food place, even though that might bring in some income in the short-term, because they'rethinking about the long term -- so we as a country have to make current choices with an eye for the future.If we don't invest now in renewable energy, if we don't invest now in a skilled workforce, if we don't investnow in a more affordable health care system, this economy simply won't grow at the pace it needs to in twoor five or 10 years down the road. If we don't lay this new foundation now, it won't be long before we're rightback where we are today. And I can assure you that chronically slow growth will not help our long-termbudget situation. That's the second point.Third point, the problem with our deficit and debt is not new. It has been building dramatically over the pasteight years, largely because big tax cuts combined with increased spending on two wars and the increasedcosts of government health care programs have pushed it ever upwards. This structural gap in our budget,between the amount of money that's coming in and the amount of money that's going out, will only getworse as the baby boomers age, and will in fact lead us down an unsustainable path.But let's not kid ourselves and suggest that we can solve this problem by trimming a few earmarks or cuttingthe budget for the National Endowment for the Arts. That's just not true. Along with defense and interest onthe national debt, the biggest cost drivers in our budget are entitlement programs like Medicare, Medicaid,and Social Security -- all of which get more and more expensive every year. So if we want to get seriousabout fiscal discipline, and I do, then we're going to not only have to trim waste out of our discretionarybudget -- which we've already begun -- we will also have to get serious about entitlement reform.Now, nothing will be more important to this goal than passing health care reform that brings down costsacross the system, including in Medicare and Medicaid. So make no mistake, health care reform isentitlement reform. That's not just my opinion -- that was the conclusion of a wide range of participants atthe Fiscal Responsibility Summit that we held at the White House in February. And that's one of the reasonswhy I firmly believe we need to get health care reform done this year.Once we tackle rising health care costs, we must also work to put Social Security on firmer footing. It's timefor both parties to come together and find a way to keep the promise of a sound retirement for futuregenerations. And we should restore a sense of fairness and balance to our tax code including by shuttingdown corporate loopholes and ensuring that everyone pays what they owe.All of these efforts will require tough choices. All these efforts will require compromise. But the difficultiescan't serve as an excuse for inaction -- not anymore -- which brings me to one final point I'd like to maketoday. I've talked a lot about the fundamental weakness in our economy that led us to this day of reckoning.But we also arrived here because of a fundamental weakness in our political system.For too long, too many in Washington put off hard decisions for some other time on some other day. There'sbeen a tendency to spend a lot of time scoring political points instead of rolling up sleeves to solve realproblems.There's also an impatience that characterizes this town -- an attention span that has only grown shorter withthe 24-hour news cycle that insists on instant gratification in the form of immediate results or higher pollnumbers. When a crisis hits, there's all too often a lurch from shock to trance, with everyone responding tothe tempest of the moment until the furor has died down, the media coverage has moved on to somethingelse, instead of confronting the major challenges that will shape our future in a sustained and focused way.This can't be one of those times. The challenges are too great. The stakes are too high. I know how difficultit is for members of Congress in both parties to grapple with some of the big decisions we face right now. I'dlove if these problems were coming at us one at a time instead of five or six at a time. It's more than mostCongresses and most Presidents have to deal with in a lifetime.But we have been called to govern in extraordinary times. And that requires an extraordinary sense ofresponsibility -- to ourselves, to the men and women who sent us here, to the many generations whose liveswill be affected for good or for ill because of what we do here.There is no doubt that times are still tough. By no means are we out of the woods just yet. But from wherewe stand, for the very first time, we're beginning to see glimmers of hope. And beyond that, way off in thedistance, we can see a vision of an America's future that is far different than our troubled economic past. It'san America teeming with new industry and commerce, humming with new energy and discoveries that lightthe world once more -- a place where anyone from anywhere with a good idea or the will to work can live thedream they've heard so much about.That is the house upon the rock -- proud, sturdy, unwavering in the face of the greatest storms. And we willnot finish it in one year. We will not finish it in many. But if we use this moment to lay that new foundation, ifwe come together and begin the hard work of rebuilding, if we persist and persevere against thedisappointments and setbacks that will surely lie ahead, then I have no doubt that this house will stand andthe dream of our founders will live on in our time.Thank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.",obama
"Thank you very much. To Sara Bloomfield, for the wonderful introduction and the outstandingwork she's doing; to Fred Zeidman; Joel Geiderman; Mr. Wiesel -- thank you for your wisdomand your witness; Speaker Nancy Pelosi; Senator Dick Durbin; members of Congress; ourgood friend the Ambassador of Israel; members of the United States Holocaust MemorialCouncil; and most importantly, the survivors and rescuers and their families who are heretoday. It is a great honor for me to be here, and I'm grateful that I have the opportunity toaddress you briefly.We gather today to mourn the loss of so many lives, and celebrate those who saved them;honor those who survived, and contemplate the obligations of the living.It is the grimmest of ironies that one of the most savage, barbaric acts of evil in history beganin one of the most modernized societies of its time, where so many markers of humanprogress became tools of human depravity: science that can heal used to kill; education thatcan enlighten used to rationalize away basic moral impulses; the bureaucracy that sustainsmodern life used as the machinery of mass death -- a ruthless, chillingly efficient systemwhere many were responsible for the killing, but few got actual blood on their hands.While the uniqueness of the Holocaust in scope and in method is truly astounding, theHolocaust was driven by many of the same forces that have fueled atrocities throughouthistory: the scapegoating that leads to hatred and blinds us to our common humanity; thejustifications that replace conscience and allow cruelty to spread; the willingness of those whoare neither perpetrators nor victims to accept the assigned role of bystander, believing the liethat good people are ever powerless or alone, the fiction that we do not have a choice.But while we are here today to bear witness to the human capacity to destroy, we are alsohere to pay tribute to the human impulse to save. In the moral accounting of the Holocaust,as we reckon with numbers like 6 million, as we recall the horror of numbers etched intoarms, we also factor in numbers like these: 7,200 -- the number of Danish Jews ferried tosafety, many of whom later returned home to find the neighbors who rescued them had alsofaithfully tended their homes and businesses and belongings while they were gone.We remember the number five -- the five righteous men and women who join us today fromPoland. We are awed by your acts of courage and conscience. And your presence todaycompels each of us to ask ourselves whether we would have done what you did. We can onlyhope that the answer is yes.We also remember the number 5,000 -- the number of Jews rescued by the villagers of LeChambon, France -- one life saved for each of its 5,000 residents. Not a single Jew who camethere was turned away, or turned in. But it was not until decades later that the villagers spokeof what they had done -- and even then, only reluctantly. The author of a book on the rescuefound that those he interviewed were baffled by his interest. ""How could you call us 'good'?""they said. ""We were doing what had to be done.""That is the question of the righteous -- those who would do extraordinary good atextraordinary risk not for affirmation or acclaim or to advance their own interests, but becauseit is what must be done. They remind us that no one is born a savior or a murderer -- theseare choices we each have the power to make. They teach us that no one can make us intobystanders without our consent, and that we are never truly alone -- that if we have thecourage to heed that ""still, small voice"" within us, we can form a minyan for righteousnessthat can span a village, even a nation.Their legacy is our inheritance. And the question is, how do we honor and preserve it? How dowe ensure that ""never again"" isn't an empty slogan, or merely an aspiration, but also a call toaction?I believe we start by doing what we are doing today -- by bearing witness, by fighting thesilence that is evil's greatest co-conspirator.In the face of horrors that defy comprehension, the impulse to silence is understandable. Myown great uncle returned from his service in World War II in a state of shock, saying little,alone with painful memories that would not leave his head. He went up into the attic,according to the stories that I've heard, and wouldn't come down for six months. He was oneof the liberators -- someone who at a very tender age had seen the unimaginable. And sosome of the liberators who are here today honor us with their presence -- all of whom wehonor for their extraordinary service. My great uncle was part of the 89th Infantry Division --the first Americans to reach a Nazi concentration camp. And they liberated Ohrdruf, part ofBuchenwald, where tens of thousands had perished.The story goes that when the Americans marched in, they discovered the starving survivorsand the piles of dead bodies. And General Eisenhower made a decision. He ordered Germansfrom the nearby town to tour the camp, so they could see what had been done in their name.And he ordered American troops to tour the camp, so they could see the evil they werefighting against. Then he invited congressmen and journalists to bear witness. And he orderedthat photographs and films be made. Some of us have seen those same images, whether inthe Holocaust Museum or when I visited Yad Vashem, and they never leave you. Eisenhowersaid that he wanted ""to be in a position to give firsthand evidence of these things, if ever, inthe future, there develops a tendency to charge these allegations merely to propaganda.""Eisenhower understood the danger of silence. He understood that if no one knew what hadhappened, that would be yet another atrocity -- and it would be the perpetrators' ultimatetriumph.What Eisenhower did to record these crimes for history is what we are doing here today.That's what Elie Wiesel and the survivors we honor here do by fighting to make theirmemories part of our collective memory. That's what the Holocaust Museum does every dayon our National Mall, the place where we display for the world our triumphs and failures andthe lessons we've learned from our history. It's the very opposite of silence.But we must also remember that bearing witness is not the end of our obligation -- it's justthe beginning. We know that evil has yet to run its course on Earth. We've seen it in thiscentury in the mass graves and the ashes of villages burned to the ground, and children usedas soldiers and rape used as a weapon of war. To this day, there are those who insist theHolocaust never happened; who perpetrate every form of intolerance -- racism and anti-Semitism, homophobia, xenophobia, sexism, and more -- hatred that degrades its victim anddiminishes us all.Today, and every day, we have an opportunity, as well as an obligation, to confront thesescourges -- to fight the impulse to turn the channel when we see images that disturb us, orwrap ourselves in the false comfort that others' sufferings are not our own. Instead we havethe opportunity to make a habit of empathy; to recognize ourselves in each other; to commitourselves to resisting injustice and intolerance and indifference in whatever forms they maytake -- whether confronting those who tell lies about history, or doing everything we can toprevent and end atrocities like those that took place in Rwanda, those taking place in Darfur.That is my commitment as President. I hope that is yours, as well.It will not be easy. At times, fulfilling these obligations require self-reflection. But in the finalanalysis, I believe history gives us cause for hope rather than despair -- the hope of a chosenpeople who have overcome oppression since the days of Exodus; of the nation of Israel risingfrom the destruction of the Holocaust; of the strong and enduring bonds between our nations.It is the hope, too, of those who not only survived, but chose to live, teaching us the meaningof courage and resilience and dignity. I'm thinking today of a study conducted after the warthat found that Holocaust survivors living in America actually had a higher birthrate thanAmerican Jews. What a stunning act of faith -- to bring a child in a world that has shown youso much cruelty; to believe that no matter what you have endured, or how much you havelost, in the end, you have a duty to life.We find cause for hope as well in Protestant and Catholic children attending school together inNorthern Ireland; in Hutus and Tutsis living side by side, forgiving neighbors who have donethe unforgivable; in a movement to save Darfur that has thousands of high school and collegechapters in 25 countries, and brought 70,000 people to the Washington Mall -- people ofevery age and faith and background and race united in common cause with suffering brothersand sisters halfway around the world.Those numbers can be our future -- our fellow citizens of the world showing us how to makethe journey from oppression to survival, from witness to resistance, and ultimately toreconciliation. That is what we mean when we say ""never again.""So today, during this season when we celebrate liberation, resurrection, and the possibility ofredemption, may each of us renew our resolve to do what must be done. And may we striveeach day, both individually and as a nation, to be among the righteous.Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.",obama
"Well, to President DeGioia, thank you so much for the gracious introduction, and thanks for bringing yourfamily -- including JT -- appreciate you. We're going to invite him over, hang out with the girls. He's a prettygood-looking young man.To Mayor Adrian Fenty, who's doing such a great job in this city, thank you so much for your attendance. ToRepresentative Donna Edwards, who is here and represents Maryland's 4th District, thank you.To Georgetown University students, it is great to be here. Well, it is good to be back. I appeared in this roomduring the campaign and had a wonderful reception then, and it's wonderful to be back and be with all ofyou.We're going to talk about the economy today. And I was telling President DeGioia this may be a slightlylonger speech than I usually give, but it's a slightly bigger topic, and that is how we are going to deal with somany of our economic challenges.You know, it's been 12 weeks now since my administration began. And I think that even our critics wouldagree that at the very least, we've been busy. In just under three months, we've responded to anextraordinary set of economic challenges with extraordinary action -- action that's been unprecedented bothin terms of its scale and its speed.And I know that some have accused us of taking on too much at once. Others believe we haven't doneenough. And many Americans are simply wondering how all of our different programs and policies fittogether in a single, overarching strategy that will move this economy from recession to recovery andultimately to prosperity.So today, I want to step back for a moment and explain our strategy as clearly as I can. This is going to beprose, and not poetry. I want to talk about what we've done, why we've done it, and what we have left to do.I want to update you on the progress we've made, but I also want to be honest about the pitfalls that maystill lie ahead.Most of all, I want every American to know that each action we take and each policy we pursue is driven bya larger vision of America's future -- a future where sustained economic growth creates good jobs and risingincomes; a future where prosperity is fueled not by excessive debt, or reckless speculation, or fleetingprofits, but is instead built by skilled, productive workers, by sound investments that will spread opportunityat home and allow this nation to lead the world in the technologies and the innovation and discoveries thatwill shape the 21st century. That's the America I see. That's the America that Georgetown is preparing somany of you for. That is the future that I know that we can have.Now, to understand how we get there, we first need to understand how we got here.Recessions are not uncommon. Markets and economies naturally ebb and flow, as we've seen many timesin our history. But this recession is different. This recession was not caused by a normal downturn in thebusiness cycle. It was caused by a perfect storm of irresponsibility and poor decision-making that stretchedfrom Wall Street to Washington to Main Street.As has been widely reported, it started in the housing market. During the course of the decade, the formulafor buying a house changed: Instead of saving their pennies to buy their dream house, many Americansfound that suddenly they could take out loans that by traditional standards their incomes just could notsupport. Others were tricked into signing these subprime loans by lenders who were trying to make a quickprofit. The reason these loans were so readily available was that Wall Street saw big profits to be made.Investment banks would buy and package together these questionable mortgages into securities, arguingthat by pooling the mortgages the risks had somehow been reduced. And credit agencies that are supposedto help investors determine the soundness of various investments stamped the securities with their safestrating when they should have been labeled ""Buyer Beware.""No one really knew what the actual value of these securities were, no one fully understood what the riskswere. But since the housing market was booming and prices were rising, banks and investors just keptbuying and selling them, always passing off the risk to someone else for a greater profit without having totake any of the ultimate responsibility. Banks took on more debt than they could handle.The government-chartered companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, whose traditional mandate was to helpsupport traditional mortgages, decided to get in on the action by buying and holding billions of dollars ofthese securities. AIG, the biggest insurer in the world that had a very traditional insurance business that wasvery profitable, decided to make profits suddenly by selling billions of dollars of complicated financialinstruments that supposedly insured these securities. Everybody was making record profits -- except thewealth created was real only on paper. And as the bubble grew, there was almost no accountability oroversight from anyone in Washington.Then the housing bubble burst. Home prices fell. People began to default on their subprime mortgages. Andthe value of all those loans and securities plummeted. Banks and investors couldn't find anyone to buythem. Greed gave way to fear. Investors pulled their money out of the market. Large financial institutionsthat didn't have enough money on hand to pay off all their obligations collapsed. Other banks held on tight totheir money and simply stopped lending.Now, this is when the crisis spread from Wall Street to Main Street. After all, the ability to get a loan is howyou finance the purchase of everything from a home to a car to, as you all know very well, a collegeeducation. It's how stores stock their shelves, and farms buy equipment, and businesses make payroll. Sowhen banks stopped lending money, businesses started laying off workers. When laid-off workers had lessmoney to spend, businesses were forced to lay off even more workers. When people couldn't get a car loan,a bad situation at the auto companies became even worse. When people couldn't get home loans, the crisisin the housing market only deepened. Because the infected securities were being traded worldwide andother nations also had weak regulations, this recession soon became global. And when other nations can'tafford to buy our goods, it slows our economy even further.So this is the situation, the downward spiral that we confronted on the day that we took office. So our mosturgent task has been to clear away the wreckage, repair the immediate damage to the economy, and doeverything we can to prevent a larger collapse. And since the problems we face are all working off eachother to feed a vicious economic downturn, we've had no choice but to attack all fronts of our economiccrisis simultaneously.The first step was to fight a severe shortage of demand in the economy. So the Federal Reserve did this bydramatically lowering interest rates last year in order to boost investment. My administration and Congressboosted demand by passing the largest recovery plan in our nation's history. It's a plan that's already in theprocess of saving or creating 3.5 million jobs over the next two years. It's putting money directly intopeople's pockets with a tax cut for 95 percent of working families that's now showing up in paychecks acrossAmerica. And to cushion the blow of this recession, we also provided extended unemployment benefits andcontinued health care coverage to Americans who've lost their jobs through no fault of their own.Now, you will recall that some argued this recovery plan is a case of irresponsible government spending,that it's somehow to blame for our long-term deficit projections, and that the federal government should becutting instead of increasing spending right now. So I want to tackle this argument head on.To begin with, economists on both the left and the right agree that the last thing a government should do inthe middle of a recession is to cut back on spending. You see, when this recession began, many families sataround the kitchen table and tried to figure out where they could cut back. And so have many businesses.And this is a completely reasonable and understandable reaction. But if everybody -- if everybody -- if everyfamily in America, if every business in America cuts back all at once, then no one is spending any money,which means there are no customers, which means there are more layoffs, which means the economy getseven worse. That's why the government has to step in and temporarily boost spending in order to stimulatedemand. That's exactly what we're doing right now.Second, I absolutely agree that our long-term deficit is a major problem that we have to fix. But the fact isthat this recovery plan represents only a tiny fraction of that long-term deficit. As I'll discuss in a moment, thekey to dealing with our long-term deficit and our national debt is to get a handle on out-of-control health carecosts -- not to stand idly by as the economy goes into free fall.So the recovery plan has been the first step in confronting this economic crisis. The second step has beento heal our financial system so that credit is once again flowing to the businesses and families who rely on it.The heart of this financial crisis is that too many banks and other financial institutions simply stoppedlending money. In a climate of fear, banks were unable to replace their losses from some of those badmortgages by raising new capital on their own, and they were unwilling to lend the money they did havebecause they were afraid that no one would pay it back. It's for this reason that the last administration usedwhat they called the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, to provide these banks with temporaryfinancial assistance in order to get them lending again.Now, I understand that TARP is not popular, and I have to say that I don't agree with some of the ways theTARP program was managed, but I do agree with the broader rationale that we must provide banks with thecapital and the confidence necessary to start lending again. That's the purpose of the stress tests that willsoon tell us how much additional capital will be needed to support lending at our largest banks. Ideally,these needs will be met by private investors who are willing to put in money to these banks. But where that'snot possible, and banks require substantial additional resources from the government, then we will holdaccountable those who are responsible, we'll force the necessary adjustments, we'll provide the support toclean up those bank balance sheets, and we will assure the continuity of a strong and viable institution thatcan serve our people and our economy.Of course, there are some who differ with our approach. On the one hand, there are some who argue thatthe government should stand back and simply let these banks fail -- especially since in many cases it wastheir bad decisions that helped create the crisis in the first place. But whether we like it or not, history hasshown repeatedly that when nations do not take early and aggressive action to get credit flowing again, theyhave crises that last years and years instead of months and months -- years of low growth, years of low jobcreation, years of low investment, all of which cost these nations far more than a course of bold, upfrontaction.And although there are a lot of Americans who understandably think that government money would bebetter spent going directly to families and businesses instead of to banks -- one of my most frequentquestions in the letters that I get from constituents is, ""Where's my bailout?"" -- and I understand thesentiment. It makes sense intuitively, and morally it makes sense, but the truth is that a dollar of capital in abank can actually result in $8 or $10 of loans to families and businesses. So that's a multiplier effect thatcan ultimately lead to a faster pace of economic growth. That's why we have to fix the banks.Now, on the other hand, there have been some who don't dispute that we need to shore up the bankingsystem, but they suggest that we've been too timid in how we go about it. This is essentially thenationalization argument that some of you may have heard. And the argument says that the federalgovernment should have already preemptively stepped in and taken over major financial institutions the waythat the FDIC currently intervenes in smaller banks, and that our failure, my administration's failure to do sois yet another example of Washington coddling Wall Street -- ""Why aren't you tougher on the banks?""So let me be clear: The reason we have not taken this step has nothing to do with any ideological or politicaljudgment we've made about government involvement in banks. It's certainly not because of any concern wehave for the management and shareholders whose actions helped to cause this mess. Rather, it's becausewe believe that preemptive government takeovers are likely to end up costing taxpayers even more in theend, and because it's more likely to undermine than create confidence.Governments should practice the same principle as doctors: First, do no harm. So rest assured -- we will dowhatever is necessary to get credit flowing again, but we will do so in ways that minimize risks to taxpayersand to the broader economy. To that end, in addition to the program to provide capital to the banks, we'velaunched a plan that will pair government resources with private investment in order to clear away the oldloans and securities -- the so-called toxic assets -- that are also preventing our banks from lending money.Now, what we've also learned during this crisis is that our banks aren't the only institutions affected by thesetoxic assets that are clogging the financial system. AIG, for example, is not a bank, it's an insurancecompany, as I mentioned -- and yet because it chose to insure billions of dollars worth of risky assets,essentially creating a hedge fund on top of an insurance company, its failure could threaten the entirefinancial system and freeze lending even more. And that's why, as frustrating as it is -- and I promise you,nobody is more frustrated than me with AIG -- I promise -- we had to provide support for AIG, because theentire system, as fragile as it is, could be profoundly endangered if AIG went into a liquidation bankruptcy.It's also why we need new legal authority so that we have the power to intervene in such financialinstitutions, the same way that bankruptcy courts currently do with businesses that hit hard times but don'tpose systemic risks -- and that way we can restructure these businesses in an orderly way that doesn'tinduce panic in the financial system -- and, by the way, will allow us to restructure inappropriate bonuscontracts without creating a perception the government can just change compensation rules on a whim.This is also why we're moving aggressively to unfreeze markets and jumpstart lending outside the bankingsystem, where more than half of all lending in America actually takes place. To do this, we've started aprogram that will increase guarantees for small business loans and unlock the market for auto loans andstudent loans. And to stabilize the housing market, we've launched a plan that will save up to four millionresponsible homeowners from foreclosure and help many millions more to refinance their homes.In a few weeks, we will also reassess the state of Chrysler and General Motors, two companies with animportant place in our history and a large footprint in our economy -- but two companies that have also fallenon hard times.Late last year, the companies were given transitional loans by the previous administration to tide them overas they worked to develop viable business plans. Unfortunately, the plans they developed fell short, sowe've given them some additional time to work these complex issues through. And by the way, we owedthat not to the executives whose bad bets contributed to the weakening of their companies, but to thehundreds of thousands of workers whose livelihoods hang in the balance -- entire towns, entirecommunities, entire states are profoundly impacted by what happens in the auto industry.Now, it is our fervent hope that in the coming weeks, Chrysler will find a viable partner and GM will developa business plan that will put it on a path to profitability without endless support from American taxpayer. Inthe meantime, we're taking steps to spur demand for American cars and provide relief for autoworkers andtheir communities. And we will continue to reaffirm this nation's commitment to a 21st-century Americanauto industry that creates new jobs and builds the fuel-efficient cars and trucks that will carry us toward aclean-energy future.Finally, to coordinate a global response to this global recession, I went to the meeting of the G20 nations inLondon the other week. Each nation has undertaken significant stimulus to spur demand. All agreed topursue tougher regulatory reforms. We also agreed to triple the lending capacity of the InternationalMonetary Fund -- which, as many of you know, is an international financial institution supported by all themajor economies -- so that they can provide direct assistance to developing nations and vulnerablepopulations. That's not just charity; because America's success depends on whether other nations have theability to buy what we sell, it's important that we pay attention to these emerging markets.We pledged to avoid the trade barriers and protectionism that hurts us all in the end. And we decided tomeet again in the fall to gauge our progress and take additional steps if necessary.So that's where we've been, that's what we've done in the last three months. All of these actions -- theRecovery Act, the bank capitalization program, the housing plan, the strengthening of the non-bank creditmarket, the auto plan, and our work at the G20 -- all have been necessary pieces of the recovery puzzle.They've been designed to increase aggregate demand to get credit flowing again to families and businessesand to help families and businesses ride out the storm. And taken together, these actions are starting togenerate signs of economic progress.Because of our recovery plan, schools and police departments have cancelled planned layoffs; clean energycompanies and construction companies are re-hiring workers to build everything from energy-efficientwindows to new roads and highways. Our housing plan has helped lead to a spike in the number ofhomeowners who are taking advantage of historically-low mortgage rates by refinancing, which is likeputting a $2,000 tax cut in your pocket. Our program to support the market for auto loans and student loanshas started to unfreeze this market and securitize more of this lending in the last few weeks. And smallbusinesses are seeing a jump in loan activity for the first time in months.Now, this is all welcome and encouraging news. It does not mean the hard times are over; 2009 willcontinue to be a difficult year for America's economy, and obviously, most difficult for those who've lost theirjobs. The severity of this recession will cause more job loss, more foreclosures, and more pain before itends. The market will continue to rise and fall. Credit is still not flowing nearly as easily as it should. Theprocess for restructuring AIG and the auto companies will involve difficult and sometimes unpopularchoices; we are not finished yet on that front. And all of this means that there's much more work to be done.But all of this also means that you can continue to expect an unrelenting, unyielding, day-by-day effort fromthis administration to fight for economic recovery on all fronts.But even as we continue to clear away the wreckage and address the immediate crisis, it is my firm beliefthat our next task, beginning now, is to make sure such a crisis never happens again. Even as we clean upbalance sheets and get credit flowing again, even as people start spending and businesses start hiring -- allthat's going to happen -- we have to realize that we cannot go back to the bubble-and-bust economy that ledus to this point.It is simply not sustainable to have a 21st-century financial system that is governed by 20th-century rulesand regulations that allowed the recklessness of a few to threaten the entire economy. It is not sustainableto have an economy where in one year, 40 percent of our corporate profits came from a financial sector thatwas based on inflated home prices, maxed-out credit cards, over-leveraged banks and overvalued assets.It's not sustainable to have an economy where the incomes of the top 1 percent has skyrocketed while thetypical working household has seen their incomes decline by nearly $2,000. That's just not a sustainablemodel for long-term prosperity.For even as too many were out there chasing ever-bigger bonuses and short-term profits over the lastdecade, we continued to neglect the long-term threats to our prosperity: the crushing burden that the risingcost of health care is placing on families and businesses; the failure of our education system to prepare ourworkers for a new age; the progress that other nations are making on clean energy industries andtechnologies while we -- we remain addicted to foreign oil; the growing debt that we're passing on to ourchildren. Even after we emerge from the current recession, these challenges will still represent majorobstacles that stand in the way of our success in the 21st century. So we've got a lot of work to do.Now, there's a parable at the end of the Sermon on the Mount that tells the story of two men. The first builthis house on a pile of sand, and it was soon destroyed when a storm hit. But the second is known as thewise man, for when ""the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon thathouse, it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.""It was founded upon a rock. We cannot rebuild this economy on the same pile of sand. We must build ourhouse upon a rock. We must lay a new foundation for growth and prosperity -- a foundation that will moveus from an era of borrow and spend to one where we save and invest; where we consume less at home andsend more exports abroad.It's a foundation built upon five pillars that will grow our economy and make this new century anotherAmerican century: Number one, new rules for Wall Street that will reward drive and innovation, not recklessrisk-taking; number two, new investments in education that will make our workforce more skilled andcompetitive; number three, new investments in renewable energy and technology that will create new jobsand new industries; number four, new investments in health care that will cut costs for families andbusinesses; and number five, new savings in our federal budget that will bring down the debt for futuregenerations.That's the new foundation we must build. That's our house built upon a rock. That must be our future -- andmy administration's policies are designed to achieve that future.Let me talk about each of these steps in turn. The first step we will take to build this foundation is to reformthe outdated rules and regulations that allowed this crisis to happen in the first place. It is time to lay downtough new rules of the road for Wall Street to ensure that we never find ourselves here again. Just as afterthe Great Depression new rules were designed for banks to avoid the kind of reckless speculation thathelped to create the depression, so we've got to make adaptations to our current set of rules: create rulesthat punish shortcuts and abuse; rules that tie someone's pay to their actual job performance --- a novelconcept; rules that protect typical American families when they buy a home, get a credit card or invest in a401(k). So we've already begun to work with Congress to shape this comprehensive new regulatoryframework -- and I expect a bill to arrive on my desk for my signature before the year is out.The second pillar of this new foundation is an education system that finally prepares our workers for a 21stcentury economy. You know, in the 20th century, the G.I. Bill helped send a generation to college. Fordecades we led the world in educational attainment, and as a consequence we led the world in economicgrowth. But in this new economy, we've come to trail the world's leaders in graduation rates, in educationalachievement, in the production of scientists and engineers. That's why we have set a goal that will greatlyenhance our ability to compete for the high-wage, high-tech jobs of the 21st century: By 2020, America willonce again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world. That is the goal that we have setand we intend to do.To meet that goal, we have to start early. So we've already dramatically expanded early childhoodeducation. We are investing in innovative programs that have proven to help schools meet high standardsand close achievement gaps. We're creating new rewards that tie teachers' performance and new pathwaysfor advancement. And I've asked every American to commit to at least one year or more of higher educationor career training, and we have provided tax credits to make a college education more affordable for everyAmerican, even those who attend Georgetown.And, by the way, one of the changes that I would like to see -- and I'm going to be talking about this inweeks to come -- is once again seeing our best and our brightest commit themselves to making things --engineers, scientists, innovators. For so long, we have placed at the top of our pinnacle folks who canmanipulate numbers and engage in complex financial calculations. And that's good, we need some of that.But you know what we can really use is some more scientists and some more engineers, who are buildingand making things that we can export to other countries.Now, the third pillar of this new foundation is to harness the renewable energy that can create millions ofnew jobs and new industries. We all know that the country that harnesses this new energy source will leadthe 21st century. Yet we've allowed other countries to outpace us on this race to the future. I don't knowabout you, but I do not accept a future where the jobs and industries of tomorrow take root beyond ourborders. I think it's time for America to lead again.So the investments we made in the Recovery Act will double this nation's supply of renewable energy in thenext three years. And we are putting Americans to work making our homes and buildings more efficient sothat we can save billions on our energy bills and grow our economy at the same time.Now, the only though that we can truly spark the transformation that's need is through a gradual, market-based cap on carbon pollution, so that clean energy is the profitable kind of energy.There are those who've argued that we shouldn't attempt, we shouldn't even be thinking, we shouldn't evenbe talking about such a transition until the economy recovers. And they are right that we have to take intoaccount the costs of transition. Transitioning to a clean energy economy will not be easy. But we can nolonger delay putting a framework for a clean energy economy in place. That needs to be done now.If businesses and entrepreneurs know today that we are closing this carbon pollution loophole, they'll startinvesting in clean energy now. And pretty soon, we'll see more companies constructing solar panels, andworkers building wind turbines, and car companies manufacturing fuel-efficient cars. Investors will put somemoney into a new energy technology, and a small business will open to start selling it. That's how we cangrow this economy, enhance our security, and protect our planet at the same time.Now, the fourth pillar of our new foundation is a 21st century health care system where families, businessesand government budgets aren't dragged down by skyrocketing insurance premiums. One and a half millionAmericans could lose their homes this year just because of a medical crisis. Major American corporationsare struggling to compete with their foreign counterparts. Small businesses are closing their doors. We can'tallow the cost of health care to continue strangling our economy.And that's why our Recovery Act will invest in electronic health records with strict privacy standards that cansave money and lives and reduce medical error. That's why we've made the largest investment ever inpreventive care, because that's one of the best ways to keep costs under control. And included in thebudgets that just passed Congress is an historic commitment to reform that will finally make quality healthcare affordable for every American. So I'm looking forward in the next few months to working with bothparties in Congress to make this reform a reality. We can get this done -- and we have to get it done.Now, fixing our health care system will -- will require resources; it's not going to be free. But in my budgetwe've made a commitment to fully pay for reform without increasing the deficit, and we've identified specificsavings that will make the health care system more efficient and reduce costs for us all.In fact, we've undertaken an unprecedented effort to find this kind of savings in every corner of the budget,because the final pillar in building our new foundation is restoring fiscal discipline once this economyrecovers.Already we've identified $2 trillion dollars in deficit reductions over the next decade. We need to do more,but we've already done that. We've announced procurement reform that will greatly reduce no-bid contractsand save the government $40 billion. We need to do more, but that's an important start. Secretary Gatesrecently announced a courageous set of reforms that go right at the hundreds of billions of dollars in wasteand cost overruns that have bloated our defense budget without making America safer. We need to domore, but that proposal by Secretary Gates is right on target. We will end education programs that don'twork, we will root out waste and fraud and abuse in our Medicare program.Altogether, this budget will reduce discretionary spending for domestic programs as a share of the economyby more than 10 percent over the next decade to the lowest level we've seen since we began keepingrecords nearly half a century ago. And as we continue to go through the federal budget line by line, we willbe announcing additional savings, secured by eliminating and consolidating programs that we don't need sowe can make room for the things that we do need.That's what we're doing now. Of course, I realize that for some, this isn't enough. I know there's a criticismout there that my administration has been spending with reckless abandon, pushing a liberal social agendawhile mortgaging our children's future. You've heard the argument.Well, let me make three points. First, as I said earlier, the worst thing that we could do in a recession thissevere is to try to cut government spending at the same time as families and businesses around the worldare cutting back on their spending. So as serious as our deficit and debt problems are -- and they are veryserious -- major efforts to deal with them have to focus on the medium and long-term budget picture, not onthe short-term. And that's exactly what we've done.Second, in tackling the deficit issue, we simply cannot sacrifice the long-term investments that we sodesperately need to generate long-term prosperity. That's the argument that some critics have made: Well,you're proposing health care reform, you shouldn't be doing that; you're proposing education investments,you shouldn't be doing that, that adds to the deficit.Look, just as a cash-strapped family may cut back on all kinds of luxuries, but will still insist on spendingmoney to get their children through college, will refuse to have their kids drop out of college and go to workin some fast-food place, even though that might bring in some income in the short-term, because they'rethinking about the long term -- so we as a country have to make current choices with an eye for the future.If we don't invest now in renewable energy, if we don't invest now in a skilled workforce, if we don't investnow in a more affordable health care system, this economy simply won't grow at the pace it needs to in twoor five or 10 years down the road. If we don't lay this new foundation now, it won't be long before we're rightback where we are today. And I can assure you that chronically slow growth will not help our long-termbudget situation. That's the second point.Third point, the problem with our deficit and debt is not new. It has been building dramatically over the pasteight years, largely because big tax cuts combined with increased spending on two wars and the increasedcosts of government health care programs have pushed it ever upwards. This structural gap in our budget,between the amount of money that's coming in and the amount of money that's going out, will only getworse as the baby boomers age, and will in fact lead us down an unsustainable path.But let's not kid ourselves and suggest that we can solve this problem by trimming a few earmarks or cuttingthe budget for the National Endowment for the Arts. That's just not true. Along with defense and interest onthe national debt, the biggest cost drivers in our budget are entitlement programs like Medicare, Medicaid,and Social Security -- all of which get more and more expensive every year. So if we want to get seriousabout fiscal discipline, and I do, then we're going to not only have to trim waste out of our discretionarybudget -- which we've already begun -- we will also have to get serious about entitlement reform.Now, nothing will be more important to this goal than passing health care reform that brings down costsacross the system, including in Medicare and Medicaid. So make no mistake, health care reform isentitlement reform. That's not just my opinion -- that was the conclusion of a wide range of participants atthe Fiscal Responsibility Summit that we held at the White House in February. And that's one of the reasonswhy I firmly believe we need to get health care reform done this year.Once we tackle rising health care costs, we must also work to put Social Security on firmer footing. It's timefor both parties to come together and find a way to keep the promise of a sound retirement for futuregenerations. And we should restore a sense of fairness and balance to our tax code including by shuttingdown corporate loopholes and ensuring that everyone pays what they owe.All of these efforts will require tough choices. All these efforts will require compromise. But the difficultiescan't serve as an excuse for inaction -- not anymore -- which brings me to one final point I'd like to maketoday. I've talked a lot about the fundamental weakness in our economy that led us to this day of reckoning.But we also arrived here because of a fundamental weakness in our political system.For too long, too many in Washington put off hard decisions for some other time on some other day. There'sbeen a tendency to spend a lot of time scoring political points instead of rolling up sleeves to solve realproblems.There's also an impatience that characterizes this town -- an attention span that has only grown shorter withthe 24-hour news cycle that insists on instant gratification in the form of immediate results or higher pollnumbers. When a crisis hits, there's all too often a lurch from shock to trance, with everyone responding tothe tempest of the moment until the furor has died down, the media coverage has moved on to somethingelse, instead of confronting the major challenges that will shape our future in a sustained and focused way.This can't be one of those times. The challenges are too great. The stakes are too high. I know how difficultit is for members of Congress in both parties to grapple with some of the big decisions we face right now. I'dlove if these problems were coming at us one at a time instead of five or six at a time. It's more than mostCongresses and most Presidents have to deal with in a lifetime.But we have been called to govern in extraordinary times. And that requires an extraordinary sense ofresponsibility -- to ourselves, to the men and women who sent us here, to the many generations whose liveswill be affected for good or for ill because of what we do here.There is no doubt that times are still tough. By no means are we out of the woods just yet. But from wherewe stand, for the very first time, we're beginning to see glimmers of hope. And beyond that, way off in thedistance, we can see a vision of an America's future that is far different than our troubled economic past. It'san America teeming with new industry and commerce, humming with new energy and discoveries that lightthe world once more -- a place where anyone from anywhere with a good idea or the will to work can live thedream they've heard so much about.That is the house upon the rock -- proud, sturdy, unwavering in the face of the greatest storms. And we willnot finish it in one year. We will not finish it in many. But if we use this moment to lay that new foundation, ifwe come together and begin the hard work of rebuilding, if we persist and persevere against thedisappointments and setbacks that will surely lie ahead, then I have no doubt that this house will stand andthe dream of our founders will live on in our time.Thank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.",obama
"Good evening. Pause for laughter. Wait a minute, this may not be working as well as I -- Letme try that again. Good evening, everybody. I would like to welcome you all to the 10-day anniversary of myfirst 100 days. I am Barack Obama. Most of you covered me. All of you voted for me.Apologies to the Fox table. They're -- Where are they? I have to confess I really did not wantto be here tonight, but I knew I had to come -- just one more problem that I've inherited fromGeorge W. Bush.But now that I'm here, it's great to be here. It's great to see all of you. Michelle Obama ishere, the First Lady of the United States. Hasn't she been an outstanding First Lady? She'seven begun to bridge the differences that have divided us for so long, because no matterwhich party you belong to we can all agree that Michelle has the right to bare arms.Now Sasha and Malia aren't here tonight because they're grounded. You can't just take AirForce One on a joy ride to Manhattan. I don't care whose kids you are. We've been settingsome ground rules here. They're starting to get a little carried away. Now, speaking -- when I think about children obviously I think about Michelle and it remindsme that tomorrow is Mother's Day. Happy Mother's Day to all the mothers in the audience. Ido have to say, though, that this is a tough holiday for Rahm Emanuel because he's not usedto saying the word ""day"" after ""mother."" That's true.David Axelrod is here. You know, David and I have been together for a long time. I can stillremember -- I got to sort of -- I tear up a little bit when I think back to that day that I calledAx so many years ago and said, you and I can do wonderful things together. And he said tome the same thing that partners all across America are saying to one another right now: Let'sgo to Iowa and make it official.Michael Steele is in the house tonight. Or as he would say, ""in the heezy."" What's up? Whereis Michael? Michael, for the last time, the Republican Party does not qualify for a bailout. RushLimbaugh does not count as a troubled asset, I'm sorry.Dick Cheney was supposed to be here but he is very busy working on his memoirs, tentativelytitled, ""How to Shoot Friends and Interrogate People.""You know, it's been a whirlwind of activity these first hundred days. We've enacted a majoreconomic recovery package, we passed a budget, we forged a new path in Iraq, and noPresident in history has ever named three Commerce Secretaries this quickly. Which remindsme, if Judd Gregg is here, your business cards are ready now.On top of that, I've also reversed the ban on stem cell research, signed an expansion --signed an expansion of the children's health insurance. Just last week, Car and Driver namedme auto executive of the year. Something I'm very proud of.We've also begun to change the culture in Washington. We've even made the White House aplace where people can learn and can grow. Just recently, Larry Summers asked if he couldchair the White House Council on Women and Girls. And I do appreciate that Larry is heretonight because it is seven hours past his bedtime. Gibbs liked that one. In the last hundred days, we've also grown the Democratic Party by infusing it with newenergy and bringing in fresh, young faces like Arlen Specter. Now, Joe Biden rightly deservesa lot of credit for convincing Arlen to make the switch, but Secretary Clinton actually had a lotto do with it too. One day she just pulled him aside and she said, Arlen, you know what Ialways say -- ""if you can't beat them, join them."" Which brings me to another thing that's changed in this new, warmer, fuzzier White House,and that's my relationship with Hillary. You know, we had been rivals during the campaign,but these days we could not be closer. In fact, the second she got back from Mexico shepulled into a hug and gave me a big kiss. Told me I'd better get down there myself. Which Ireally appreciated. I mean, it was -- it was nice.And of course we've also begun to change America's image in the world. We talked about thisduring this campaign and we're starting to execute. We've renewed alliances with importantpartners and friends. If you look on the screen there, there I am with Japanese Prime MinisterTaro Aso. There I am with Gordon Brown. But as I said during the campaign, we can't just talk to our friends. As hard as it is, we alsohave to talk to our enemies, and I've begun to do exactly that. Take a look at the monitorthere. Now, let me be clear, just because he handed me a copy of Peter Pan does not meanthat I'm going to read it -- but it's good diplomatic practice to just accept these gifts.All this change hasn't been easy. Change never is. So I've cut the tension by bringing a newfriend to the White House. He's warm, he's cuddly, loyal, enthusiastic. You just have to keephim on a tight leash. Every once in a while he goes charging off in the wrong direction andgets himself into trouble. But enough about Joe Biden.All in all, we're proud of the change we've brought to Washington in these first hundred daysbut we've got a lot of work left to do, as all of you know. So I'd like to talk a little bit aboutwhat my administration plans to achieve in the next hundred days.During the second hundred days, we will design, build and open a library dedicated to my firsthundred days. It's going to be big, folks. In the next hundred days, I will learn to go off theprompter and Joe Biden will learn to stay on the prompter.In the next hundred days, our bipartisan outreach will be so successful that even JohnBoehner will consider becoming a Democrat. After all, we have a lot in common. He is aperson of color. Although not a color that appears in the natural world. What's up, John?In the next hundred days, I will meet with a leader who rules over millions with an iron fist,who owns the airwaves and uses his power to crush all who would challenge his authority atthe ballot box. It's good to see you, Mayor Bloomberg. In the next hundred days, we will housetrain our dog, Bo, because the last thing Tim Geithnerneeds is someone else treating him like a fire hydrant. In the next hundred days, I willstrongly consider losing my cool.Finally, I believe that my next hundred days will be so successful I will be able to completethem in 72 days. And on the 73rd day, I will rest. I just -- I want to end by saying a few words about the men and women in this room whosejob it is to inform the public and pursue the truth. You know, we meet tonight at a moment ofextraordinary challenge for this nation and for the world, but it's also a time of real hardshipfor the field of journalism. And like so many other businesses in this global age, you've seensweeping changes and technology and communications that lead to a sense of uncertainty andanxiety about what the future will hold.Across the country, there are extraordinary, hardworking journalists who have lost their jobsin recent days, recent weeks, recent months. And I know that each newspaper and mediaoutlet is wrestling with how to respond to these changes, and some are struggling simply tostay open. And it won't be easy. Not every ending will be a happy one. But it's also true that your ultimate success as an industry is essential to the success of ourdemocracy. It's what makes this thing work. You know, Thomas Jefferson once said that if hehad the choice between a government without newspapers, or newspapers without agovernment, he would not hesitate to choose the latter. Clearly, Thomas Jefferson never had cable news to contend with -- but his central pointremains: A government without newspapers, a government without a tough and vibrantmedia of all sorts, is not an option for the United States of America.So I may not -- I may not agree with everything you write or report. I may even complain, ormore likely Gibbs will complain, from time to time about how you do your jobs, but I do sowith the knowledge that when you are at your best, then you help me be at my best. You helpall of us who serve at the pleasure of the American people do our jobs better by holding usaccountable, by demanding honesty, by preventing us from taking shortcuts and falling intoeasy political games that people are so desperately weary of. And that kind of reporting is worth preserving -- not just for your sake, but for the public's.We count on you to help us make sense of a complex world and tell the stories of our lives theway they happen, and we look for you for truth, even if it's always an approximation, even if -- This is a season of renewal and reinvention. That is what government must learn to do, that'swhat businesses must learn to do, and that's what journalism is in the process of doing. Andwhen I look out at this room and think about the dedicated men and women whose questionsI've answered over the last few years, I know that for all the challenges this industry faces,it's not short on talent or creativity or passion or commitment. It's not short of young peoplewho are eager to break news or the not-so-young who still manage to ask the tough onestime and time again. These qualities alone will not solve all your problems, but they certainlyprove that the problems are worth solving. And that is a good place as any to begin.So I offer you my thanks, I offer you my support, and I look forward to working with you andanswering to you and the American people as we seek a more perfect union in the monthsand years ahead.Thank you very much, everybody.Thank you.",obama

"Good morning, everybody.  Please be seated.  Thank you all for being here.  Let me just acknowledge thepresence of some of my outstanding Cabinet members and advisors.  We've got our Secretary of State,Hillary Clinton.  We have our CIA Director Leon Panetta.  We have our Secretary of Defense William Gates;Secretary Napolitano of Department of Homeland Security; Attorney General Eric Holder; my NationalSecurity Advisor Jim Jones.  And I want to especially thank our Acting Archivist of the United States,Adrienne Thomas.I also want to acknowledge several members of the House who have great interest in intelligence matters.  Iwant to thank Congressman Reyes, Congressman Hoekstra, Congressman King, as well as CongressmanThompson, for being here today.  Thank you so much.These are extraordinary times for our country.  We're confronting a historic economic crisis.  We're fightingtwo wars.  We face a range of challenges that will define the way that Americans will live in the 21stcentury.  So there's no shortage of work to be done, or responsibilities to bear.And we've begun to make progress.  Just this week, we've taken steps to protect American consumers andhomeowners, and to reform our system of government contracting so that we better protect our people whilespending our money more wisely.  The -- it's a good bill.  The engines of our economy are slowly beginningto turn, and we're working towards historic reform on health care and on energy.  I want to say to themembers of Congress, I welcome all the extraordinary work that has been done over these last four monthson these and other issues.In the midst of all these challenges, however, my single most important responsibility as President is to keepthe American people safe.  It's the first thing that I think about when I wake up in the morning.  It's the lastthing that I think about when I go to sleep at night.And this responsibility is only magnified in an era when an extremist ideology threatens our people, andtechnology gives a handful of terrorists the potential to do us great harm.  We are less than eight yearsremoved from the deadliest attack on American soil in our history.  We know that al Qaeda is activelyplanning to attack us again.  We know that this threat will be with us for a long time, and that we must use allelements of our power to defeat it.Already, we've taken several steps to achieve that goal.  For the first time since 2002, we're providing thenecessary resources and strategic direction to take the fight to the extremists who attacked us on 9/11 inAfghanistan and Pakistan.  We're investing in the 21st century military and intelligence capabilities that willallow us to stay one step ahead of a nimble enemy.  We have re-energized a global non-proliferation regimeto deny the world's most dangerous people access to the world's deadliest weapons.  And we've launchedan effort to secure all loose nuclear materials within four years.  We're better protecting our border, andincreasing our preparedness for any future attack or natural disaster.  We're building new partnershipsaround the world to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda and its affiliates.  And we have renewedAmerican diplomacy so that we once again have the strength and standing to truly lead the world.These steps are all critical to keeping America secure.  But I believe with every fiber of my being that in thelong run we also cannot keep this country safe unless we enlist the power of our most fundamental values. The documents that we hold in this very hall -- the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill ofRights -- these are not simply words written into aging parchment.  They are the foundation of liberty andjustice in this country, and a light that shines for all who seek freedom, fairness, equality, and dignity aroundthe world.I stand here today as someone whose own life was made possible by these documents.  My father came tothese shores in search of the promise that they offered.  My mother made me rise before dawn to learn theirtruths when I lived as a child in a foreign land.  My own American journey was paved by generations ofcitizens who gave meaning to those simple words -- ""to form a more perfect union.""  I've studied theConstitution as a student, I've taught it as a teacher, I've been bound by it as a lawyer and a legislator.  Itook an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution as Commander-in-Chief, and as a citizen, Iknow that we must never, ever, turn our back on its enduring principles for expedience sake.I make this claim not simply as a matter of idealism.  We uphold our most cherished values not onlybecause doing so is right, but because it strengthens our country and it keeps us safe.  Time and again, ourvalues have been our best national security asset -- in war and peace; in times of ease and in eras ofupheaval.Fidelity to our values is the reason why the United States of America grew from a small string of coloniesunder the writ of an empire to the strongest nation in the world.It's the reason why enemy soldiers have surrendered to us in battle, knowing they'd receive better treatmentfrom America's Armed Forces than from their own government.It's the reason why America has benefitted from strong alliances that amplified our power, and drawn asharp, moral contrast with our adversaries.It's the reason why we've been able to overpower the iron fist of fascism and outlast the iron curtain ofcommunism, and enlist free nations and free peoples everywhere in the common cause and common effortof liberty.From Europe to the Pacific, we've been the nation that has shut down torture chambers and replacedtyranny with the rule of law.  That is who we are.  And where terrorists offer only the injustice of disorder anddestruction, America must demonstrate that our values and our institutions are more resilient than a hatefulideology.After 9/11, we knew that we had entered a new era -- that enemies who did not abide by any law of warwould present new challenges to our application of the law; that our government would need new tools toprotect the American people, and that these tools would have to allow us to prevent attacks instead ofsimply prosecuting those who try to carry them out.Unfortunately, faced with an uncertain threat, our government made a series of hasty decisions.  I believethat many of these decisions were motivated by a sincere desire to protect the American people.  But I alsobelieve that all too often our government made decisions based on fear rather than foresight; that all toooften our government trimmed facts and evidence to fit ideological predispositions.  Instead of strategicallyapplying our power and our principles, too often we set those principles aside as luxuries that we could nolonger afford.  And during this season of fear, too many of us -- Democrats and Republicans, politicians,journalists, and citizens -- fell silent.In other words, we went off course.  And this is not my assessment alone.  It was an assessment that wasshared by the American people who nominated candidates for President from both major parties who,despite our many differences, called for a new approach -- one that rejected torture and one that recognizedthe imperative of closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay.Now let me be clear:  We are indeed at war with al Qaeda and its affiliates.  We do need to update ourinstitutions to deal with this threat.  But we must do so with an abiding confidence in the rule of law and dueprocess; in checks and balances and accountability.  For reasons that I will explain, the decisions that weremade over the last eight years established an ad hoc legal approach for fighting terrorism that was neithereffective nor sustainable -- a framework that failed to rely on our legal traditions and time-tested institutions,and that failed to use our values as a compass.  And that's why I took several steps upon taking office tobetter protect the American people.First, I banned the use of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques by the United States of America.I know some have argued that brutal methods like waterboarding were necessary to keep us safe.  I couldnot disagree more.  As Commander-in-Chief, I see the intelligence.  I bear the responsibility for keeping thiscountry safe.  And I categorically reject the assertion that these are the most effective means ofinterrogation.  What's more, they undermine the rule of law.  They alienate us in the world.  They serve as arecruitment tool for terrorists, and increase the will of our enemies to fight us, while decreasing the will ofothers to work with America.They risk the lives of our troops by making it less likely that others will surrender to them in battle, and morelikely that Americans will be mistreated if they are captured.  In short, they did not advance our war andcounterterrorism efforts -- they undermined them, and that is why I ended them once and for all.Now, I should add, the arguments against these techniques did not originate from my administration.  AsSenator McCain once said, torture ""serves as a great propaganda tool for those who recruit people to fightagainst us.""  And even under President Bush, there was recognition among members of his ownadministration -- including a Secretary of State, other senior officials, and many in the military andintelligence community -- that those who argued for these tactics were on the wrong side of the debate, andthe wrong side of history.  That's why we must leave these methods where they belong -- in the past.  Theyare not who we are, and they are not America.The second decision that I made was to order the closing of the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay.For over seven years, we have detained hundreds of people at Guantanamo.  During that time, the systemof military commissions that were in place at Guantanamo succeeded in convicting a grand total of threesuspected terrorists.  Let me repeat that:  three convictions in over seven years.  Instead of bringingterrorists to justice, efforts at prosecution met setback after setback, cases lingered on, and in 2006 theSupreme Court invalidated the entire system.  Meanwhile, over 525 detainees were released fromGuantanamo under not my administration, under the previous administration.  Let me repeat that:  Two-thirds of the detainees were released before I took office and ordered the closure of Guantanamo.There is also no question that Guantanamo set back the moral authority that is America's strongest currencyin the world.  Instead of building a durable framework for the struggle against al Qaeda that drew upon ourdeeply held values and traditions, our government was defending positions that undermined the rule of law. In fact, part of the rationale for establishing Guantanamo in the first place was the misplaced notion that aprison there would be beyond the law -- a proposition that the Supreme Court soundly rejected.  Meanwhile,instead of serving as a tool to counter terrorism, Guantanamo became a symbol that helped al Qaedarecruit terrorists to its cause.  Indeed, the existence of Guantanamo likely created more terrorists around theworld than it ever detained.So the record is clear:  Rather than keeping us safer, the prison at Guantanamo has weakened Americannational security.  It is a rallying cry for our enemies.  It sets back the willingness of our allies to work with usin fighting an enemy that operates in scores of countries.  By any measure, the costs of keeping it open farexceed the complications involved in closing it.  That's why I argued that it should be closed throughout mycampaign, and that is why I ordered it closed within one year.The third decision that I made was to order a review of all pending cases at Guantanamo.  I knew when Iordered Guantanamo closed that it would be difficult and complex.  There are 240 people there who havenow spent years in legal limbo.  In dealing with this situation, we don't have the luxury of starting fromscratch.  We're cleaning up something that is, quite simply, a mess -- a misguided experiment that has left inits wake a flood of legal challenges that my administration is forced to deal with on a constant, almost dailybasis, and it consumes the time of government officials whose time should be spent on better protecting ourcountry.Indeed, the legal challenges that have sparked so much debate in recent weeks here in Washington wouldbe taking place whether or not I decided to close Guantanamo.  For example, the court order to release 17Uighurs -- 17 Uighur detainees took place last fall, when George Bush was President.  The Supreme Courtthat invalidated the system of prosecution at Guantanamo in 2006 was overwhelmingly appointed byRepublican Presidents -- not wild-eyed liberals.  In other words, the problem of what to do with Guantanamodetainees was not caused by my decision to close the facility; the problem exists because of the decision toopen Guantanamo in the first place. Now let me be blunt.  There are no neat or easy answers here.  I wish there were.  But I can tell you that thewrong answer is to pretend like this problem will go away if we maintain an unsustainable status quo.  AsPresident, I refuse to allow this problem to fester.  I refuse to pass it on to somebody else.  It is myresponsibility to solve the problem.  Our security interests will not permit us to delay.  Our courts won't allowit.  And neither should our conscience.Now, over the last several weeks, we've seen a return of the politicization of these issues that havecharacterized the last several years.  I'm an elected official; I understand these problems arouse passionsand concerns.  They should.  We're confronting some of the most complicated questions that a democracycan face.  But I have no interest in spending all of our time relitigating the policies of the last eight years.  I'llleave that to others.  I want to solve these problems, and I want to solve them together as Americans.And we will be ill-served by some of the fear-mongering that emerges whenever we discuss this issue. Listening to the recent debate, I've heard words that, frankly, are calculated to scare people rather thaneducate them; words that have more to do with politics than protecting our country.  So I want to take thisopportunity to lay out what we are doing, and how we intend to resolve these outstanding issues.  I willexplain how each action that we are taking will help build a framework that protects both the Americanpeople and the values that we hold most dear.  And I'll focus on two broad areas:  first, issues relating toGuantanamo and our detention policy; but, second, I also want to discuss issues relating to security andtransparency.Now, let me begin by disposing of one argument as plainly as I can:  We are not going to release anyone if itwould endanger our national security, nor will we release detainees within the United States who endangerthe American people.  Where demanded by justice and national security, we will seek to transfer somedetainees to the same type of facilities in which we hold all manner of dangerous and violent criminals withinour borders -- namely, highly secure prisons that ensure the public safety. As we make these decisions, bear in mind the following face:  Nobody has ever escaped from one of ourfederal, supermax prisons, which hold hundreds of convicted terrorists.  As Republican Lindsey Grahamsaid, the idea that we cannot find a place to securely house 250-plus detainees within the United States isnot rational.We are currently in the process of reviewing each of the detainee cases at Guantanamo to determine theappropriate policy for dealing with them.  And as we do so, we are acutely aware that under the lastadministration, detainees were released and, in some cases, returned to the battlefield.  That's why we aredoing away with the poorly planned, haphazard approach that let those detainees go in the past.  Insteadwe are treating these cases with the care and attention that the law requires and that our security demands.Now, going forward, these cases will fall into five distinct categories.First, whenever feasible, we will try those who have violated American criminal laws in federal courts --courts provided for by the United States Constitution.  Some have derided our federal courts as incapable ofhandling the trials of terrorists.  They are wrong.  Our courts and our juries, our citizens, are tough enough toconvict terrorists.  The record makes that clear.  Ramzi Yousef tried to blow up the World Trade Center.  Hewas convicted in our courts and is serving a life sentence in U.S. prisons.  Zacarias Moussaoui has beenidentified as the 20th 9/11 hijacker.  He was convicted in our courts, and he too is serving a life sentence inprison.  If we can try those terrorists in our courts and hold them in our prisons, then we can do the samewith detainees from Guantanamo.Recently, we prosecuted and received a guilty plea from a detainee, al-Marri, in federal court after years oflegal confusion.  We're preparing to transfer another detainee to the Southern District Court of New York,where he will face trial on charges related to the 1998 bombings of our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania --bombings that killed over 200 people.  Preventing this detainee from coming to our shores would prevent histrial and conviction.  And after over a decade, it is time to finally see that justice is served, and that is whatwe intend to do.The second category of cases involves detainees who violate the laws of war and are therefore best triedthrough military commissions.  Military commissions have a history in the United States dating back toGeorge Washington and the Revolutionary War.  They are an appropriate venue for trying detainees forviolations of the laws of war.  They allow for the protection of sensitive sources and methods of intelligence-gathering; they allow for the safety and security of participants; and for the presentation of evidencegathered from the battlefield that cannot always be effectively presented in federal courts.Now, some have suggested that this represents a reversal on my part.  They should look at the record.  In2006, I did strongly oppose legislation proposed by the Bush administration and passed by the Congressbecause it failed to establish a legitimate legal framework, with the kind of meaningful due process rights forthe accused that could stand up on appeal.I said at that time, however, that I supported the use of military commissions to try detainees, provided therewere several reforms, and in fact there were some bipartisan efforts to achieve those reforms.  Those arethe reforms that we are now making.  Instead of using the flawed commissions of the last seven years, myadministration is bringing our commissions in line with the rule of law.  We will no longer permit the use ofevidence -- as evidence statements that have been obtained using cruel, inhuman, or degradinginterrogation methods.  We will no longer place the burden to prove that hearsay is unreliable on theopponent of the hearsay.  And we will give detainees greater latitude in selecting their own counsel, andmore protections if they refuse to testify.  These reforms, among others, will make our military commissionsa more credible and effective means of administering justice, and I will work with Congress and members ofboth parties, as well as legal authorities across the political spectrum, on legislation to ensure that thesecommissions are fair, legitimate, and effective.The third category of detainees includes those who have been ordered released by the courts.  Now, let merepeat what I said earlier:  This has nothing to do with my decision to close Guantanamo.  It has to do withthe rule of law.The courts have spoken.  They have found that there's no legitimate reason to hold 21 of the peoplecurrently held at Guantanamo.  Nineteen of these findings took place before I was sworn into office.  Icannot ignore these rulings because as President, I too am bound by the law.  The United States is a nationof laws and so we must abide by these rulings.The fourth category of cases involves detainees who we have determined can be transferred safely toanother country.  So far, our review team has approved 50 detainees for transfer.  And my administration isin ongoing discussions with a number of other countries about the transfer of detainees to their soil fordetention and rehabilitation.Now, finally, there remains the question of detainees at Guantanamo who cannot be prosecuted yet whopose a clear danger to the American people.  And I have to be honest here -- this is the toughest singleissue that we will face.  We're going to exhaust every avenue that we have to prosecute those atGuantanamo who pose a danger to our country.  But even when this process is complete, there may be anumber of people who cannot be prosecuted for past crimes, in some cases because evidence may betainted, but who nonetheless pose a threat to the security of the United States.  Examples of that threatinclude people who've received extensive explosives training at al Qaeda training camps, or commandedTaliban troops in battle, or expressed their allegiance to Osama bin Laden, or otherwise made it clear thatthey want to kill Americans.  These are people who, in effect, remain at war with the United States.Let me repeat:  I am not going to release individuals who endanger the American people.  Al Qaedaterrorists and their affiliates are at war with the United States, and those that we capture -- like otherprisoners of war -- must be prevented from attacking us again.  Having said that, we must recognize thatthese detention policies cannot be unbounded.  They can't be based simply on what I or the executivebranch decide alone.  That's why my administration has begun to reshape the standards that apply toensure that they are in line with the rule of law. We must have clear, defensible, and lawful standards forthose who fall into this category.  We must have fair procedures so that we don't make mistakes.  We musthave a thorough process of periodic review, so that any prolonged detention is carefully evaluated andjustified.I know that creating such a system poses unique challenges. And other countries have grappled with thisquestion; now, so must we.  But I want to be very clear that our goal is to construct a legitimate legalframework for the remaining Guantanamo detainees that cannot be transferred.  Our goal is not to avoid alegitimate legal framework.  In our constitutional system, prolonged detention should not be the decision ofany one man.  If and when we determine that the United States must hold individuals to keep them fromcarrying out an act of war, we will do so within a system that involves judicial and congressional oversight. And so, going forward, my administration will work with Congress to develop an appropriate legal regime sothat our efforts are consistent with our values and our Constitution.Now, as our efforts to close Guantanamo move forward, I know that the politics in Congress will be difficult. These are issues that are fodder for 30-second commercials.  You can almost picture the direct mail piecesthat emerge from any vote on this issue -- designed to frighten the population.  I get it.  But if we continue tomake decisions within a climate of fear, we will make more mistakes.  And if we refuse to deal with theseissues today, then I guarantee you that they will be an albatross around our efforts to combat terrorism inthe future.I have confidence that the American people are more interested in doing what is right to protect this countrythan in political posturing.  I am not the only person in this city who swore an oath to uphold the Constitution-- so did each and every member of Congress.  And together we have a responsibility to enlist our values inthe effort to secure our people, and to leave behind the legacy that makes it easier for future Presidents tokeep this country safe.Now, let me touch on a second set of issues that relate to security and transparency. National security requires a delicate balance.  One the one hand, our democracy depends on transparency. On the other hand, some information must be protected from public disclosure for the sake of our security --for instance, the movement of our troops, our intelligence-gathering, or the information we have about aterrorist organization and its affiliates.  In these and other cases, lives are at stake.Now, several weeks ago, as part of an ongoing court case, I released memos issued by the previousadministration's Office of Legal Counsel.  I did not do this because I disagreed with the enhancedinterrogation techniques that those memos authorized, and I didn't release the documents because Irejected their legal rationales -- although I do on both counts.  I released the memos because the existenceof that approach to interrogation was already widely known, the Bush administration had acknowledged itsexistence, and I had already banned those methods.  The argument that somehow by releasing thosememos we are providing terrorists with information about how they will be interrogated makes no sense. We will not be interrogating terrorists using that approach.  That approach is now prohibited.In short, I released these memos because there was no overriding reason to protect them.  And the ensuingdebate has helped the American people better understand how these interrogation methods came to beauthorized and used.On the other hand, I recently opposed the release of certain photographs that were taken of detainees byU.S. personnel between 2002 and 2004.  Individuals who violated standards of behavior in these photoshave been investigated and they have been held accountable.  There was and is no debate as to whetherwhat is reflected in those photos is wrong.  Nothing has been concealed to absolve perpetrators of crimes. However, it was my judgment -- informed by my national security team -- that releasing these photos wouldinflame anti-American opinion and allow our enemies to paint U.S. troops with a broad, damning, andinaccurate brush, thereby endangering them in theaters of war.In short, there is a clear and compelling reason to not release these particular photos.  There are nearly200,000 Americans who are serving in harm's way, and I have a solemn responsibility for their safety asCommander-in-Chief.  Nothing would be gained by the release of these photos that matters more than thelives of our young men and women serving in harm's way.Now, in the press's mind and in some of the public's mind, these two cases are contradictory.  They are notto me.  In each of these cases, I had to strike the right balance between transparency and national security. And this balance brings with it a precious responsibility.  There's no doubt that the American people haveseen this balance tested over the last several years.  In the images from Abu Ghraib and the brutalinterrogation techniques made public long before I was President, the American people learned of actionstaken in their name that bear no resemblance to the ideals that generations of Americans have fought for.And whether it was the run-up to the Iraq war or the revelation of secret programs, Americans often felt likepart of the story had been unnecessarily withheld from them.  And that caused suspicion to build up.  Andthat leads to a thirst for accountability.I understand that.  I ran for President promising transparency, and I meant what I said.  And that's why,whenever possible, my administration will make all information available to the American people so that theycan make informed judgments and hold us accountable.  But I have never argued -- and I never will -- thatour most sensitive national security matters should simply be an open book.  I will never abandon -- and willvigorously defend -- the necessity of classification to defend our troops at war, to protect sources andmethods, and to safeguard confidential actions that keep the American people safe.  Here's the differencethough:  Whenever we cannot release certain information to the public for valid national security reasons, Iwill insist that there is oversight of my actions -- by Congress or by the courts.We're currently launching a review of current policies by all those agencies responsible for the classificationof documents to determine where reforms are possible, and to assure that the other branches ofgovernment will be in a position to review executive branch decisions on these matters.  Because in oursystem of checks and balances, someone must always watch over the watchers -- especially when it comesto sensitive administration -- information.Now, along these same lines, my administration is also confronting challenges to what is known as the""state secrets"" privilege.  This is a doctrine that allows the government to challenge legal cases involvingsecret programs.  It's been used by many past Presidents -- Republican and Democrat -- for manydecades.  And while this principle is absolutely necessary in some circumstances to protect nationalsecurity, I am concerned that it has been over-used.  It is also currently the subject of a wide range oflawsuits.  So let me lay out some principles here.  We must not protect information merely because itreveals the violation of a law or embarrassment to the government.  And that's why my administration isnearing completion of a thorough review of this practice.And we plan to embrace several principles for reform.  We will apply a stricter legal test to material that canbe protected under the state secrets privilege.  We will not assert the privilege in court without first followingour own formal process, including review by a Justice Department committee and the personal approval ofthe Attorney General.  And each year we will voluntarily report to Congress when we have invoked theprivilege and why because, as I said before, there must be proper oversight over our actions.On all these matters related to the disclosure of sensitive information, I wish I could say that there was somesimple formula out there to be had.  There is not.  These often involve tough calls, involve competingconcerns, and they require a surgical approach.  But the common thread that runs through all of mydecisions is simple:  We will safeguard what we must to protect the American people, but we will alsoensure the accountability and oversight that is the hallmark of our constitutional system.  I will never hide thetruth because it's uncomfortable.  I will deal with Congress and the courts as co-equal branches ofgovernment.  I will tell the American people what I know and don't know, and when I release somethingpublicly or keep something secret, I will tell you why.Now, in all the areas that I've discussed today, the policies that I've proposed represent a new direction fromthe last eight years.  To protect the American people and our values, we've banned enhanced interrogationtechniques.We are closing the prison at Guantanamo.  We are reforming military commissions, and we will pursue anew legal regime to detain terrorists.  We are declassifying more information and embracing more oversightof our actions, and we're narrowing our use of the state secrets privilege.  These are dramatic changes thatwill put our approach to national security on a surer, safer, and more sustainable footing.  Theirimplementation will take time, but they will get done.There's a core principle that we will apply to all of our actions.  Even as we clean up the mess atGuantanamo, we will constantly reevaluate our approach, subject our decisions to review from otherbranches of government, as well as the public.  We seek the strongest and most sustainable legalframework for addressing these issues in the long term -- not to serve immediate politics, but to do what'sright over the long term.  By doing that we can leave behind a legacy that outlasts my administration, mypresidency, that endures for the next President and the President after that -- a legacy that protects theAmerican people and enjoys a broad legitimacy at home and abroad.Now, this is what I mean when I say that we need to focus on the future.  I recognize that many still have astrong desire to focus on the past.  When it comes to actions of the last eight years, passions are high. Some Americans are angry; others want to re-fight debates that have been settled, in some cases debatesthat they have lost.  I know that these debates lead directly, in some cases, to a call for a fuller accounting,perhaps through an independent commission.I've opposed the creation of such a commission because I believe that our existing democratic institutionsare strong enough to deliver accountability.  The Congress can review abuses of our values, and there areongoing inquiries by the Congress into matters like enhanced interrogation techniques.  The Department ofJustice and our courts can work through and punish any violations of our laws or miscarriages of justice.It's no secret there is a tendency in Washington to spend our time pointing fingers at one another.  And it'sno secret that our media culture feeds the impulse that lead to a good fight and good copy.  But nothing willcontribute more than that than a extended relitigation of the last eight years.  Already, we've seen how thatkind of effort only leads those in Washington to different sides to laying blame.  It can distract us fromfocusing our time, our efforts, and our politics on the challenges of the future.We see that, above all, in the recent debate -- how the recent debate has obscured the truth and sendspeople into opposite and absolutist ends.  On the one side of the spectrum, there are those who make littleallowance for the unique challenges posed by terrorism, and would almost never put national security overtransparency.  And on the other end of the spectrum, there are those who embrace a view that can besummarized in two words:  ""Anything goes.""  Their arguments suggest that the ends of fighting terrorism canbe used to justify any means, and that the President should have blanket authority to do whatever he wants-- provided it is a President with whom they agree.Both sides may be sincere in their views, but neither side is right.  The American people are not absolutist,and they don't elect us to impose a rigid ideology on our problems.  They know that we need not sacrificeour security for our values, nor sacrifice our values for our security, so long as we approach difficultquestions with honesty and care and a dose of common sense.  That, after all, is the unique genius ofAmerica.  That's the challenge laid down by our Constitution.  That has been the source of our strengththrough the ages.  That's what makes the United States of America different as a nation.I can stand here today, as President of the United States, and say without exception or equivocation that wedo not torture, and that we will vigorously protect our people while forging a strong and durable frameworkthat allows us to fight terrorism while abiding by the rule of law.  Make no mistake:  If we fail to turn the pageon the approach that was taken over the past several years, then I will not be able to say that as President. And if we cannot stand for our core values, then we are not keeping faith with the documents that areenshrined in this hall.The Framers who drafted the Constitution could not have foreseen the challenges that have unfolded overthe last 222 years.  But our Constitution has endured through secession and civil rights, through World Warand Cold War, because it provides a foundation of principles that can be applied pragmatically; it provides acompass that can help us find our way.  It hasn't always been easy.  We are an imperfect people.  Everynow and then, there are those who think that America's safety and success requires us to walk away fromthe sacred principles enshrined in this building.  And we hear such voices today.  But over the long haul theAmerican people have resisted that temptation.  And though we've made our share of mistakes, requiredsome course corrections, ultimately we have held fast to the principles that have been the source of ourstrength and a beacon to the world.Now this generation faces a great test in the specter of terrorism.  And unlike the Civil War or World War II,we can't count on a surrender ceremony to bring this journey to an end.  Right now, in distant trainingcamps and in crowded cities, there are people plotting to take American lives.  That will be the case a yearfrom now, five years from now, and -- in all probability -- 10 years from now.  Neither I nor anyone can standhere today and say that there will not be another terrorist attack that takes American lives.  But I can saywith certainty that my administration -- along with our extraordinary troops and the patriotic men and womenwho defend our national security -- will do everything in our power to keep the American people safe.  And Ido know with certainty that we can defeat al Qaeda.  Because the terrorists can only succeed if they swelltheir ranks and alienate America from our allies, and they will never be able to do that if we stay true to whowe are, if we forge tough and durable approaches to fighting terrorism that are anchored in our timelessideals.  This must be our common purpose.I ran for President because I believe that we cannot solve the challenges of our time unless we solve themtogether.  We will not be safe if we see national security as a wedge that divides America -- it can and mustbe a cause that unites us as one people and as one nation.  We've done so before in times that were moreperilous than ours.  We will do so once again.Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.",obama
"We meet today at a transformational moment -- a moment in history when our interconnectedworld presents us, at once, with great promise but also great peril.Now, over the past four months my Administration has taken decisive steps to seize thepromise and confront these perils. We're working to recover from a global recession whilelaying a new foundation for lasting prosperity. We're strengthening our armed forces as theyfight two wars, at the same time we're renewing American leadership to confrontunconventional challenges, from nuclear proliferation to terrorism, from climate change topandemic disease. And we're bringing to government -- and to this White House --unprecedented transparency and accountability and new ways for Americans to participate intheir democracy.But none of this progress would be possible, and none of these 21st century challenges can befully met, without America's digital infrastructure -- the backbone that underpins a prosperouseconomy and a strong military and an open and efficient government. Without that foundationwe can't get the job done.It's long been said that the revolutions in communications and information technology havegiven birth to a virtual world. But make no mistake: This world -- cyberspace -- is a world thatwe depend on every single day. It's our hardware and our software, our desktops and laptopsand cell phones and Blackberries that have become woven into every aspect of our lives.It's the broadband networks beneath us and the wireless signals around us, the local networksin our schools and hospitals and businesses, and the massive grids that power our nation. It'sthe classified military and intelligence networks that keep us safe, and the World Wide Webthat has made us more interconnected than at any time in human history.So cyberspace is real. And so are the risks that come with it.It's the great irony of our Information Age -- the very technologies that empower us to createand to build also empower those who would disrupt and destroy. And this paradox -- seen andunseen -- is something that we experience every day.It's about the privacy and the economic security of American families. We rely on the Internetto pay our bills, to bank, to shop, to file our taxes. But we've had to learn a whole newvocabulary just to stay ahead of the cyber criminals who would do us harm: spyware andmalware and spoofing and phishing and botnets. Millions of Americans have been victimized,their privacy violated, their identities stolen, their lives upended, and their walletsemptied. According to one survey, in the past two years alone cyber crime has cost Americansmore than 8 billion dollars.I know how it feels to have privacy violated because it has happened to me and the peoplearound me. It's no secret that my presidential campaign harnessed the Internet andtechnology to transform our politics. What isn't widely known is that during the generalelection hackers managed to penetrate our computer systems. To all of you who donated toour campaign, I want you to all rest assured, our fundraising website was untouched. So yourconfidential personal and financial information was protected.But between August and October, hackers gained access to emails and a range of campaignfiles, from policy position papers to travel plans. And we worked closely with the CIA, with theFBI and the Secret Service, and hired security consultants to restore the security of oursystems. It was a powerful reminder: In this Information Age, one of your greatest strengths-- in our case, our ability to communicate to a wide range of supporters through the Internet -- could also be one of your greatest vulnerabilities.This is a matter, as well, of America's economic competitiveness. The small businesswoman inSt. Louis, the bond trader in the New York Stock Exchange, the workers at a global shippingcompany in Memphis, the young entrepreneur in Silicon Valley -- they all need the networksto make the next payroll, the next trade, the next delivery, the next great breakthrough. E-commerce alone last year accounted for some 132 billion dollars in retail sales.But every day we see waves of cyber thieves trolling for sensitive information -- thedisgruntled employee on the inside, the lone hacker a thousand miles away, organized crime,the industrial spy and, increasingly, foreign intelligence services. In one brazen act last year,thieves used stolen credit card information to steal millions of dollars from 130 ATM machinesin 49 cities around the world -- and they did it in just 30 minutes.A single employee of an American company was convicted of stealing intellectual propertyreportedly worth 400 million dollars. It's been estimated that last year alone cyber criminalsstole intellectual property from businesses worldwide worth up to 1 trillion dollars.In short, America's economic prosperity in the 21st century will depend on cybersecurity.And this is also a matter of public safety and national security. We count on computernetworks to deliver our oil and gas, our power and our water. We rely on them for publictransportation and air traffic control. Yet we know that cyber intruders have probed ourelectrical grid and that in other countries cyber attacks have plunged entire cities intodarkness.Our technological advantage is a key to America's military dominance. But our defense andmilitary networks are under constant attack. Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups have spokenof their desire to unleash a cyber attack on our country -- attacks that are harder to detectand harder to defend against. Indeed, in today's world, acts of terror could come not onlyfrom a few extremists in suicide vests but from a few key strokes on the computer -- aweapon of mass disruption.In one of the most serious cyber incidents to date against our military networks, severalthousand computers were infected last year by malicious software -- malware. And while nosensitive information was compromised, our troops and defense personnel had to give upthose external memory devices -- thumb drives -- changing the way they used theircomputers every day.And last year we had a glimpse of the future face of war. As Russian tanks rolled into Georgia,cyber attacks crippled Georgian government websites. The terrorists that sowed so muchdeath and destruction in Mumbai relied not only on guns and grenades but also on GPS andphones using voice-over-the-Internet.For all these reasons, it's now clear this cyber threat is one of the most serious economic andnational security challenges we face as a nation.It's also clear that we're not as prepared as we should be, as a government or as a country. In recent years, some progress has been made at the federal level. But just as we failed in thepast to invest in our physical infrastructure -- our roads, our bridges and rails -- we've failedto invest in the security of our digital infrastructure.No single official oversees cybersecurity policy across the federal government, and no singleagency has the responsibility or authority to match the scope and scale of thechallenge. Indeed, when it comes to cybersecurity, federal agencies have overlappingmissions and don't coordinate and communicate nearly as well as they should -- with eachother or with the private sector. We saw this in the disorganized response to Conficker, theInternet worm that in recent months has infected millions of computers around the world.This status quo is no longer acceptable -- not when there's so much at stake. We can and wemust do better.And that's why shortly after taking office I directed my National Security Council andHomeland Security Council to conduct a top-to-bottom review of the federal government'sefforts to defend our information and communications infrastructure and to recommend thebest way to ensure that these networks are able to secure our networks as well as ourprosperity.Our review was open and transparent. I want to acknowledge, Melissa Hathaway -- who ishere -- who is the Acting Senior Director for Cyberspace on our National Security Council, wholed the review team, as well as the Center for Strategic and International Studies bipartisanCommission on Cybersecurity, and all who were part of our 60-day review team. They listenedto a wide variety of groups, many of which are represented here today and I want to thank fortheir input: industry and academia, civil liberties and private -- privacy advocates. We listenedto every level and branch of government -- from local to state to federal, civilian, military,homeland as well as intelligence, Congress and international partners, as well. I consultedwith my national security teams, my homeland security teams, and my economic advisors.Today I'm releasing a report on our review, and can announce that my Administration willpursue a new comprehensive approach to securing America's digital infrastructure.This new approach starts at the top, with this commitment from me: From now on, our digitalinfrastructure -- the networks and computers we depend on every day -- will be treated asthey should be: as a strategic national asset. Protecting this infrastructure will be a nationalsecurity priority. We will ensure that these networks are secure, trustworthy and resilient. Wewill deter, prevent, detect, and defend against attacks and recover quickly from anydisruptions or damage.To give these efforts the high-level focus and attention they deserve -- and as part of thenew, single National Security Staff announced this week -- I'm creating a new office here atthe White House that will be led by the Cybersecurity Coordinator.  Because of the criticalimportance of this work, I will personally select this official. I'll depend on this official in allmatters relating to cybersecurity, and this official will have my full support and regular accessto me as we confront these challenges.Today, I want to focus on the important responsibilities this office will fulfill: orchestrating andintegrating all cybersecurity policies for the government; working closely with the Office ofManagement and Budget to ensure agency budgets reflect those priorities; and, in the eventof major cyber incident or attack, coordinating our response.To ensure that federal cyber policies enhance our security and our prosperity, myCybersecurity Coordinator will be a member of the National Security Staff as well as the staffof my National Economic Council.To ensure that policies keep faith with our fundamental values, this office will also include anofficial with a portfolio specifically dedicated to safeguarding the privacy and civil liberties ofthe American people.There's much work to be done, and the report we're releasing today outlines a range ofactions that we will pursue in five key areas.First, working in partnership with the communities represented here today, we will develop anew comprehensive strategy to secure America's information and communications networks.To ensure a coordinated approach across government, my Cybersecurity Coordinator will workclosely with my Chief Technology Officer, Aneesh Chopra, and my Chief Information Officer,Vivek Kundra. To ensure accountability in federal agencies, cybersecurity will be designated asone of my key management priorities. Clear milestones and performances metrics willmeasure progress. And as we develop our strategy, we will be open and transparent, which iswhy you'll find today's report and a wealth of related information on our Web site,www.whitehouse.gov.Second, we will work with all the key players -- including state and local governments and theprivate sector -- to ensure an organized and unified response to future cyber incidents. Giventhe enormous damage that can be caused by even a single cyber attack, ad hoc responses willnot do. Nor is it sufficient to simply strengthen our defenses after incidents or attacksoccur. Just as we do for natural disasters, we have to have plans and resources in placebeforehand -- sharing information, issuing warnings and ensuring a coordinated response.Third, we will strengthen the public/private partnerships that are critical to this endeavor. Thevast majority of our critical information infrastructure in the United States is owned andoperated by the private sector. So let me be very clear: My Administration will not dictatesecurity standards for private companies. On the contrary, we will collaborate with industry tofind technology solutions that ensure our security and promote prosperity.Fourth, we will continue to invest in the cutting-edge research and development necessary forthe innovation and discovery we need to meet the digital challenges of our time. And that'swhy my Administration is making major investments in our information infrastructure: layingbroadband lines to every corner of America; building a smart electric grid to deliver energymore efficiently; pursuing a next generation of air traffic control systems; and moving toelectronic health records, with privacy protections, to reduce costs and save lives.And finally, we will begin a national campaign to promote cybersecurity awareness and digitalliteracy from our boardrooms to our classrooms, and to build a digital workforce for the 21stcentury. And that's why we're making a new commitment to education in math and science,and historic investments in science and research and development. Because it's not enoughfor our children and students to master today's technologies -- social networking and e-mailing and texting and blogging -- we need them to pioneer the technologies that will allow us to work effectively through these new media and allow us to prosper in the future. Sothese are the things we will do.Let me also be clear about what we will not do. Our pursuit of cybersecurity will not -- Irepeat, will not include -- monitoring private sector networks or Internet traffic.We will preserve and protect the personal privacy and civil liberties that we cherish asAmericans. Indeed, I remain firmly committed to net neutrality so we can keep the Internet asit should be -- open and free.The task I have described will not be easy. Some 1.5 billion people around the world arealready online, and more are logging on every day. Groups and governments are sharpeningtheir cyber capabilities. Protecting our prosperity and security in this globalized world is goingto be a long, difficult struggle demanding patience and persistence over many years.But we need to remember: We're only at the beginning. The epochs of history are long -- theAgricultural Revolution; the Industrial Revolution. By comparison, our Information Age is stillin its infancy. We're only at Web 2.0. Now our virtual world is going viral. And we've only justbegun to explore the next generation of technologies that will transform our lives in ways wecan't even begin to imagine.So a new world awaits -- a world of greater security and greater potential prosperity -- if wereach for it, if we lead. So long as I'm President of the United States, we will do just that. Andthe United States -- the nation that invented the Internet, that launched an informationrevolution, that transformed the world -- will do what we did in the 20th century and leadonce more in the 21st.Thank you very much, everybody.Thank you.",obama

"Thank you so much. Good afternoon. I am honored to be in the timeless city of Cairo, and tobe hosted by two remarkable institutions. For over a thousand years, Al-Azhar has stood as abeacon of Islamic learning; and for over a century, Cairo University has been a source ofEgypt's advancement. And together, you represent the harmony between tradition andprogress. I'm grateful for your hospitality and the hospitality of the people of Egypt. And I'malso proud to carry with me the goodwill of the American people, and a greeting of peace fromMuslim communities in my country: Assalaamu alaykum [Peace be upon you].We meet at a time of great tension between the United States and Muslims around the world,tension rooted in historical forces that go beyond any current policy debate. The relationshipbetween Islam and the West includes centuries of coexistence and cooperation, but alsoconflict and religious wars. More recently, tension has been fed by colonialism that deniedrights and opportunities to many Muslims, and a Cold War in which Muslim-majority countrieswere too often treated as proxies without regard to their own aspirations. Moreover, thesweeping change brought by modernity and globalization led many Muslims to view the Westas hostile to the traditions of Islam.Violent extremists have exploited these tensions in a small but potent minority ofMuslims. The attacks of September 11, 2001 and the continued efforts of these extremists toengage in violence against civilians has led some in my country to view Islam as inevitablyhostile not only to America and Western countries, but also to human rights. All this has bredmore fear and more mistrust.So long as our relationship is defined by our differences, we will empower those who sowhatred rather than peace, those who promote conflict rather than the cooperation that canhelp all of our people achieve justice and prosperity. And this cycle of suspicion and discordmust end.I've come here to Cairo to seek a new beginning between the United States and Muslimsaround the world, one based on mutual interest and mutual respect, and one based upon thetruth that America and Islam are not exclusive and need not be in competition. Instead, theyoverlap and share common principles -- principles of justice and progress, tolerance and thedignity of all human beings.I do so recognizing that change cannot happen overnight. I know there's been a lot ofpublicity about this speech, but no single speech can eradicate years of mistrust, nor can Ianswer in the time that I have this afternoon all the complex questions that brought us to thispoint. But I am convinced that in order to move forward, we must say openly to each otherthe things we hold in our hearts and that too often are said only behind closed doors. Theremust be a sustained effort to listen to each other, to learn from each other, to respect oneanother, and to seek common ground. As the Holy Quran tells us, ""Be conscious of God andspeak always the truth."" That is what I will try to do today -- to speak the truth as best I can,humbled by the task before us, and firm in my belief that the interests we share as humanbeings are far more powerful than the forces that drive us apart.Now part of this conviction is rooted in my own experience. I'm a Christian, but my fathercame from a Kenyan family that includes generations of Muslims.  As a boy, I spent severalyears in Indonesia and heard the call of the azaan at the break of dawn and at the fall ofdusk.  As a young man, I worked in Chicago communities where many found dignity andpeace in their Muslim faith.As a student of history, I also know civilization's debt to Islam. It was Islam -- at places likeAl-Azhar -- that carried the light of learning through so many centuries, paving the way forEurope's Renaissance and Enlightenment. It was innovation in Muslim communities thatdeveloped the order of algebra, our magnetic compass and tools of navigation, our mastery ofpens and printing, our understanding of how disease spreads and how it can behealed. Islamic culture has given us majestic arches and soaring spires; timeless poetry andcherished music; elegant calligraphy and places of peaceful contemplation. And throughouthistory, Islam has demonstrated through words and deeds the possibilities of religioustolerance and racial equality.I also know that Islam has always been a part of America's story. The first nation to recognizemy country was Morocco. In signing the Treaty of Tripoli in 1796, our second President, JohnAdams, wrote, ""The United States has in itself no character of enmity against the laws,religion, or tranquility of Muslims."" And since our founding, American Muslims have enrichedthe United States.They have fought in our wars; they have served in our government; they have stood for civilrights; they have started businesses; they have taught at our universities; they've excelled inour sports arenas; they've won Nobel Prizes, built our tallest building, and lit the OlympicTorch.  And when the first Muslim American was recently elected to Congress, he took theoath to defend our Constitution using the same Holy Quran that one of our Founding Fathers -- Thomas Jefferson -- kept in his personal library.So I have known Islam on three continents before coming to the region where it was firstrevealed. That experience guides my conviction that partnership between America and Islammust be based on what Islam is, not what it isn't. And I consider it part of my responsibility asPresident of the United States to fight against negative stereotypes of Islam wherever theyappear.But, that same principle must apply to Muslim perceptions of America. Just as Muslims do notfit a crude stereotype, America is not the crude stereotype of a self-interested empire. TheUnited States has been one of the greatest sources of progress that the world has everknown. We were born out of revolution against an empire. We were founded upon the idealthat all are created equal. And we have shed blood and struggled for centuries to givemeaning to those words -- within our borders and around the world. We are shaped by everyculture, drawn from every end of the Earth, and dedicated to a simple concept: E pluribusunum -- ""Out of many, one.""Now much has been made of the fact that an African American with the name Barack HusseinObama could be elected President. But my personal story is not so unique. The dream ofopportunity for all people has not come true for everyone in America, but its promise existsfor all who come to our shores -- and that includes nearly 7 million American Muslims in ourcountry today who, by the way, enjoy incomes and educational levels that are higher than theAmerican average.Moreover, freedom in America is indivisible from the freedom to practice one's religion. That iswhy there is a mosque in every state in our union, and over 1200 mosques within ourborders.  That's why the United States government has gone to court to protect the right ofwomen and girls to wear the hijab -- and to punish those who would deny it.So let there be no doubt: Islam is a part of America. And I believe that America holds withinher the truth that regardless of race, religion, or station in life, all of us share commonaspirations -- to live in peace and security; to get an education and to work with dignity; tolove our families, our communities, and our God. These things we share. This is the hope ofall humanity.Of course, recognizing our common humanity is only the beginning of our task. Words alonecannot meet the needs of our people. These needs will be met only if we act boldly in theyears ahead, and if we understand that the challenges we face are shared and our failure tomeet them will hurt us all.For we have learned from recent experience that when a financial system weakens in onecountry, prosperity is hurt everywhere. When a new flu infects one human being, all are atrisk.  When one nation pursues a nuclear weapon, the risk of nuclear attack rises for allnations.  When violent extremists operate in one stretch of mountains, people are endangeredacross an ocean. When innocents in Bosnia and Darfur are slaughtered, that is a stain on ourcollective conscience. That is what it means to share this world in the 21st century. That is theresponsibility we have to one another as human beings.And this is a difficult responsibility to embrace. For human history has often been a record ofnations and tribes -- and, yes, religions -- subjugating one another in pursuit of their owninterests. Yet in this new age, such attitudes are self-defeating. Given our interdependence,any world order that elevates one nation or group of people over another will inevitablyfail. So whatever we think of the past, we must not be prisoners to it. Our problems must bedealt with through partnership; our progress must be shared. Now, that does not mean weshould ignore sources of tension. Indeed, it suggests the opposite:  We must face thesetensions squarely. And so in that spirit, let me speak as clearly and as plainly as I can aboutsome specific issues that I believe we must finally confront together. The first issue that we have to confront is violent extremism in all of its forms.In Ankara, I made clear that America is not -- and never will be -- at war with Islam. We will,however, relentlessly confront violent extremists who pose a grave threat to our security --because we reject the same thing that people of all faiths reject: the killing of innocent men,women, and children. And it is my first duty as President to protect the American people.The situation in Afghanistan demonstrates America's goals, and our need to worktogether. Over seven years ago, the United States pursued al Qaeda and the Taliban withbroad international support. We did not go by choice; we went because of necessity. I'maware that there's still some who would question or even justify the events of 9/11. But let usbe clear: Al Qaeda killed nearly 3,000 people on that day. The victims were innocent men,women, and children from America and many other nations who had done nothing to harmanybody. And yet al Qaeda chose to ruthlessly murder these people, claimed credit for theattack, and even now states their determination to kill on a massive scale. They have affiliatesin many countries and are trying to expand their reach. These are not opinions to be debated;these are facts to be dealt with.Now, make no mistake: We do not want to keep our troops in Afghanistan. We seek nomilitary bases there. It is agonizing for America to lose our young men and women.  It iscostly and politically difficult to continue this conflict. We would gladly bring every single oneof our troops home if we could be confident that there were not violent extremists inAfghanistan and now Pakistan determined to kill as many Americans as they possibly can. Butthat is not yet the case.  And that's why we're partnering with a coalition of 46 countries. And despite the costsinvolved, America's commitment will not weaken. Indeed, none of us should tolerate theseextremists.  They have killed in many countries. They have killed people of different faiths.But more than any other, they have killed Muslims. Their actions are irreconcilable with therights of human beings, the progress of nations, and with Islam. The Quran teaches thatwhoever kills an innocent, it is as if he has killed all mankind. And the Holy Quran also saysWhoever saves a person, it is as if he has saved all mankind. The enduring faith of over abillion people is so much bigger than the narrow hatred of a few. Islam is not part of theproblem in combating violent extremism -- it is an important part of promoting peace.Now, we also know that military power alone is not going to solve the problems in Afghanistanand Pakistan. That's why we plan to invest 1.5 billion dollars each year over the next fiveyears to partner with Pakistanis to build schools and hospitals, roads and businesses, andhundreds of millions to help those who've been displaced. That's why we are providing morethan 2.8 billion dollars to help Afghans develop their economy and deliver services that peopledepend on.Let me also address the issue of Iraq. Unlike Afghanistan, Iraq was a war of choice thatprovoked strong differences in my country and around the world. Although I believe that theIraqi people are ultimately better off without the tyranny of Saddam Hussein, I also believethat events in Iraq have reminded America of the need to use diplomacy and buildinternational consensus to resolve our problems whenever possible. Indeed, we can recall thewords of Thomas Jefferson, who said: ""I hope that our wisdom will grow with our power, andteach us that the less we use our power the greater it will be.""Today, America has a dual responsibility: to help Iraq forge a better future; and to leave Iraqto Iraqis. And I have made it clear to the Iraqi people that we pursue no bases, and no claimon their territory or resources. Iraq's sovereignty is its own. And that's why I ordered theremoval of our combat brigades by next August. That is why we will honor our agreement withIraq's democratically elected government to remove combat troops from Iraqi cities by July,and to remove all of our troops from Iraq by 2012. We will help Iraq train its security forcesand develop its economy. But we will support a secure and united Iraq as a partner, and neveras a patron.And finally, just as America can never tolerate violence by extremists, we must never alter orforget our principles. Nine-eleven was an enormous trauma to our country. The fear andanger that it provoked was understandable, but in some cases it led us to act contrary to ourtraditions and our ideals. We are taking concrete actions to change course. I haveunequivocally prohibited the use of torture by the United States, and I have ordered theprison at Guantanamo Bay closed by early next year. So America will defend itself, respectfulof the sovereignty of nations and the rule of law. And we will do so in partnership with Muslimcommunities which are also threatened. The sooner the extremists are isolated andunwelcome in Muslim communities, the sooner we will all be safer.The second major source of tension that we need to discuss is the situation between Israelis,Palestinians, and the Arab world.America's strong bonds with Israel are well known. This bond is unbreakable. It is based uponcultural and historical ties, and the recognition that the aspiration for a Jewish homeland isrooted in a tragic history that cannot be denied.Around the world, the Jewish people were persecuted for centuries, and anti-Semitism inEurope culminated in an unprecedented Holocaust. Tomorrow, I will visit Buchenwald, whichwas part of a network of camps where Jews were enslaved, tortured, shot, and gassed todeath by the Third Reich. Six million Jews were killed -- more than the entire Jewishpopulation of Israel today. Denying that fact is baseless; it is ignorant; and it ishateful. Threatening Israel with destruction, or repeating vile stereotypes about Jews, isdeeply wrong and only serves to evoke in the minds of Israelis this most painful of memorieswhile preventing the peace that the people of this region deserve.On the other hand, it is also undeniable that the Palestinian people -- Muslims and Christians -- has suffered in pursuit of a homeland. For more than 60 years they've endured the pain ofdislocation. Many wait in refugee camps in the West Bank, Gaza, and neighboring lands for alife of peace and security that they have never been able to lead. They endure the dailyhumiliations -- large and small -- that come with occupation. So let there be no doubt: Thesituation for the Palestinian people is intolerable. And America will not turn our backs on thelegitimate Palestinian aspiration for dignity, opportunity, and a state of their own.For decades then, there has been a stalemate: two peoples with legitimate aspirations, eachwith a painful history that makes compromise elusive. It's easy to point fingers -- forPalestinians to point to the displacement brought about by Israel's founding, and for Israelisto point to the constant hostility and attacks throughout its history from within its borders aswell as beyond. But if we see this conflict only from one side or the other, then we will beblind to the truth: The only resolution is for the aspirations of both sides to be met throughtwo states, where Israelis and Palestinians each live in peace and security.That is in Israel's interest, Palestine's interest, America's interest, and the world's interest.And that is why I intend to personally pursue this outcome with all the patience and dedicationthat the task requires. The obligations that the parties have agreed to under the road map areclear. For peace to come, it is time for them -- and all of us -- to live up to our responsibilities.Palestinians must abandon violence. Resistance through violence and killing is wrong and itdoes not succeed. For centuries, black people in America suffered the lash of the whip asslaves and the humiliation of segregation. But it was not violence that won full and equalrights. It was a peaceful and determined insistence upon the ideals at the center of America'sfounding.This same story can be told by people from South Africa to South Asia; from Eastern Europeto Indonesia. It's a story with a simple truth: Violence is a dead end. It is a sign neither ofcourage nor power to shoot rockets at sleeping children, or to blow up old women on abus. That's not how moral authority is claimed; that's how it is surrendered.Now is the time for Palestinians to focus on what they can build. The Palestinian Authoritymust develop its capacity to govern, with institutions that serve the needs of its peoples.Hamas does have support among some Palestinians, but they also have to recognize theyhave responsibilities. To play a role in fulfilling Palestinian aspirations, to unify the Palestinianpeople, Hamas must put an end to violence, recognize past agreements, recognize Israel'sright to exist.At the same time, Israelis must acknowledge that just as Israel's right to exist cannot bedenied, neither can Palestine's. The United States does not accept the legitimacy of continuedIsraeli settlements. This construction violates previous agreements and undermines efforts toachieve peace. It is time for these settlements to stop.And Israel must also live up to its obligation to ensure that Palestinians can live and work anddevelop their society. Just as it devastates Palestinian families, the continuing humanitariancrisis in Gaza does not serve Israel's security; neither does the continuing lack of opportunityin the West Bank. Progress in the daily lives of the Palestinian people must be a critical part ofa road to peace, and Israel must take concrete steps to enable such progress.And finally, the Arab states must recognize that the Arab Peace Initiative was an importantbeginning, but not the end of their responsibilities. The Arab-Israeli conflict should no longerbe used to distract the people of Arab nations from other problems. Instead, it must be acause for action to help the Palestinian people develop the institutions that will sustain theirstate, to recognize Israel's legitimacy, and to choose progress over a self-defeating focus onthe past.America will align our policies with those who pursue peace, and we will say in public what wesay in private to Israelis and Palestinians and Arabs. We cannot impose peace. But privately,many Muslims recognize that Israel will not go away. Likewise, many Israelis recognize theneed for a Palestinian state. It is time for us to act on what everyone knows to be true.Too many tears have been shed. Too much blood has been shed. All of us have aresponsibility to work for the day when the mothers of Israelis and Palestinians can see theirchildren grow up without fear; when the Holy Land of the three great faiths is the place ofpeace that God intended it to be; when Jerusalem is a secure and lasting home for Jews andChristians and Muslims, and a place for all of the children of Abraham to mingle peacefullytogether as in the story of Isra, when Moses, Jesus, and Mohammed, peace be upon them,joined in prayer.The third source of tension is our shared interest in the rights and responsibilities of nationson nuclear weapons.This issue has been a source of tension between the United States and the Islamic Republic ofIran. For many years, Iran has defined itself in part by its opposition to my country, and thereis in fact a tumultuous history between us. In the middle of the Cold War, the United Statesplayed a role in the overthrow of a democratically elected Iranian government. Since theIslamic Revolution, Iran has played a role in acts of hostage-taking and violence against U.S.troops and civilians. This history is well known. Rather than remain trapped in the past, I'vemade it clear to Iran's leaders and people that my country is prepared to move forward. Thequestion now is not what Iran is against, but rather what future it wants to build.I recognize it will be hard to overcome decades of mistrust, but we will proceed with courage,rectitude, and resolve. There will be many issues to discuss between our two countries, andwe are willing to move forward without preconditions on the basis of mutual respect. But it isclear to all concerned that when it comes to nuclear weapons, we have reached a decisivepoint. This is not simply about America's interests. It's about preventing a nuclear arms racein the Middle East that could lead this region and the world down a hugely dangerous path.I understand those who protest that some countries have weapons that others do not. Nosingle nation should pick and choose which nation holds nuclear weapons. And that's why Istrongly reaffirmed America's commitment to seek a world in which no nations hold nuclearweapons.  And any nation -- including Iran -- should have the right to access peaceful nuclearpower if it complies with its responsibilities under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Thatcommitment is at the core of the treaty, and it must be kept for all who fully abide by it. And Iam hopeful that all countries in the region can share in this goal.The fourth issue that I will address is democracy.I know there has been controversy about the promotion of democracy in recent years, andmuch of this controversy is connected to the war in Iraq. So let me be clear: No system ofgovernment can or should be imposed by one nation by any other.That does not lessen my commitment, however, to governments that reflect the will of thepeople. Each nation gives life to this principle in its own way, grounded in the traditions of itsown people. America does not presume to know what is best for everyone, just as we wouldnot presume to pick the outcome of a peaceful election. But I do have an unyielding belief thatall people yearn for certain things: the ability to speak your mind and have a say in how youare governed; confidence in the rule of law and the equal administration of justice;government that is transparent and doesn't steal from the people; the freedom to live as youchoose. These are not just American ideas; they are human rights. And that is why we willsupport them everywhere.Now, there is no straight line to realize this promise. But this much is clear: Governments thatprotect these rights are ultimately more stable, successful, and secure. Suppressing ideasnever succeeds in making them go away. America respects the right of all peaceful and law-abiding voices to be heard around the world, even if we disagree with them. And we willwelcome all elected, peaceful governments -- provided they govern with respect for all theirpeople.This last point is important because there are some who advocate for democracy only whenthey're out of power. Once in power, they are ruthless in suppressing the rights of others. Sono matter where it takes hold, government of the people and by the people sets a singlestandard for all who would hold power: You must maintain your power through consent, notcoercion; you must respect the rights of minorities, and participate with a spirit of toleranceand compromise; you must place the interests of your people and the legitimate workings ofthe political process above your party. Without these ingredients, elections alone do not maketrue democracy.Thank you. The fifth issue that we must address together is religious freedom.Islam has a proud tradition of tolerance. We see it in the history of Andalusia and Cordobaduring the Inquisition. I saw it firsthand as a child in Indonesia, where devout Christiansworshiped freely in an overwhelmingly Muslim country. That is the spirit we need today.People in every country should be free to choose and live their faith based upon thepersuasion of the mind and the heart and the soul. This tolerance is essential for religion tothrive, but it's being challenged in many different ways.Among some Muslims, there's a disturbing tendency to measure one's own faith by therejection of somebody else's faith. The richness of religious diversity must be upheld --whether it is for Maronites in Lebanon or the Copts in Egypt. And if we are being honest, faultlines must be closed among Muslims, as well, as the divisions between Sunni and Shia haveled to tragic violence, particularly in Iraq.Freedom of religion is central to the ability of peoples to live together. We must alwaysexamine the ways in which we protect it. For instance, in the United States, rules oncharitable giving have made it harder for Muslims to fulfill their religious obligation. That's whyI'm committed to working with American Muslims to ensure that they can fulfill zakat.Likewise, it is important for Western countries to avoid impeding Muslim citizens frompracticing religion as they see fit -- for instance, by dictating what clothes a Muslim womanshould wear. We can't disguise hostility towards any religion behind the pretence of liberalism.In fact, faith should bring us together. And that's why we're forging service projects inAmerica to bring together Christians, Muslims, and Jews. That's why we welcome efforts likeSaudi Arabian King Abdullah's interfaith dialogue and Turkey's leadership in the Alliance ofCivilizations. Around the world, we can turn dialogue into interfaith service, so bridgesbetween peoples lead to action -- whether it is combating malaria in Africa, or providing reliefafter a natural disaster. The sixth issue that I want to address is women's rights.I know, and you can tell from this audience, that there is a healthy debate about this issue. Ireject the view of some in the West that a woman who chooses to cover her hair is somehowless equal, but I do believe that a woman who is denied an education is denied equality. And itis no coincidence that countries where women are well educated are far more likely to beprosperous. Now, let me be clear: Issues of women's equality are by no means simply anissue for Islam. In Turkey, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, we've seen Muslim-majoritycountries elect a woman to lead. Meanwhile, the struggle for women's equality continues inmany aspects of American life, and in countries around the world.I am convinced that our daughters can contribute just as much to society as our sons. Ourcommon prosperity will be advanced by allowing all humanity -- men and women -- to reachtheir full potential. I do not believe that women must make the same choices as men in orderto be equal, and I respect those women who choose to live their lives in traditional roles. Butit should be their choice. And that is why the United States will partner with any Muslim-majority country to support expanded literacy for girls, and to help young women pursueemployment through micro-financing that helps people live their dreams.Finally, I want to discuss economic development and opportunity.I know that for many, the face of globalization is contradictory. The Internet and televisioncan bring knowledge and information, but also offensive sexuality and mindless violence intothe home. Trade can bring new wealth and opportunities, but also huge disruptions andchange in communities. In all nations -- including America -- this change can bring fear; fearthat because of modernity we lose control over our economic choices, our politics, and mostimportantly our identities -- those things we most cherish about our communities, ourfamilies, our traditions, and our faith.But I also know that human progress cannot be denied. There need not be contradictionsbetween development and tradition. Countries like Japan and South Korea grew theireconomies enormously while maintaining distinct cultures. The same is true for theastonishing progress within Muslim-majority countries from Kuala Lumpur to Dubai. In ancienttimes and in our times, Muslim communities have been at the forefront of innovation andeducation.And this is important because no development strategy can be based only upon what comesout of the ground, nor can it be sustained while young people are out of work. Many Gulfstates have enjoyed great wealth as a consequence of oil, and some are beginning to focus iton broader development. But all of us must recognize that education and innovation will bethe currency of the 21st century, and in too many Muslim communities there remainsunderinvestment in these areas. I'm emphasizing such investment within my owncountry. And while America in the past has focused on oil and gas when it comes to this partof the world, we now seek a broader engagement.On education, we will expand exchange programs, and increase scholarships, like the one thatbrought my father to America. At the same time, we will encourage more Americans to studyin Muslim communities. And we will match promising Muslim students with internships inAmerica, invest in online learning for teachers and children around the world, and create anew online network, so a young person in Kansas can communicate instantly with a youngperson in Cairo.On economic development, we will create a new corps of business volunteers to partner withcounterparts in Muslim-majority countries. And I will host a summit on entrepreneurship thisyear to identify how we can deepen ties between business leaders, foundations, and socialentrepreneurs in the United States and Muslim communities around the world.On science and technology, we will launch a new fund to support technological development inMuslim-majority countries, and to help transfer ideas to the marketplace so they can createmore jobs. We'll open centers of scientific excellence in Africa, the Middle East and SoutheastAsia, and appoint new science envoys to collaborate on programs that develop new sources ofenergy, create green jobs, digitize records, clean water, grow new crops. Today I'mannouncing a new global effort with the Organization of the Islamic Conference to eradicatepolio. And we will also expand partnerships with Muslim communities to promote child andmaternal health.All these things must be done in partnership. Americans are ready to join with citizens andgovernments; community organizations, religious leaders, and businesses in Muslimcommunities around the world to help our people pursue a better life.Now the issues that I have described will not be easy to address. But we have a responsibilityto join together on behalf of the world that we seek -- a world where extremists no longerthreaten our people, and American troops have come home; a world where Israelis andPalestinians are each secure in a state of their own, and nuclear energy is used for peacefulpurposes; a world where governments serve their citizens, and the rights of all God's childrenare respected. Those are mutual interests. That is the world we seek. But we can only achieveit together.I know there are many, Muslim and non-Muslim, who question whether we can forge this newbeginning. Some are eager to stoke the flames of division, and to stand in the way ofprogress.  Some suggest that it isn't worth the effort -- that we are fated to disagree, andcivilizations are doomed to clash. Many more are simply skeptical that real change canoccur. There's so much fear, so much mistrust that has built up over the years. But if wechoose to be bound by the past, we will never move forward.And I want to particularly say this to young people of every faith, in every country: You, morethan anyone, have the ability to reimagine the world, to remake this world. All of us share thisworld for but a brief moment in time. The question is whether we spend that time focused onwhat pushes us apart, or whether we commit ourselves to an effort -- a sustained effort -- tofind common ground, to focus on the future we seek for our children, and to respect thedignity of all human beings.It's easier to start wars than to end them. It's easier to blame others than to look inward. It'seasier to see what is different about someone than to find the things we share. But we shouldchoose the right path, not just the easy path. There's one rule that lies at the heart of everyreligion -- that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us. This truth transcendsnations and peoples -- a belief that isn't new; that isn't black or white or brown; that isn'tChristian or Muslim or Jew. It's a belief that pulsed in the cradle of civilization, and that stillbeats in the hearts of billions around the world. It's a faith in other people, and it's whatbrought me here today.We have the power to make the world we seek, but only if we have the courage to make anew beginning, keeping in mind what has been written.The Holy Quran tells us: ""O mankind! We have created you male and a female; and we havemade you into nations and tribes so that you may know one another.""The Talmud tells us: ""The whole of the Torah is for the purpose of promoting peace.""The Holy Bible tells us: ""Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God."" The people of the world can live together in peace. We know that is God's vision. Now thatmust be our work here on Earth.Thank you. And may God's peace be upon you. Thank you very much. Thank you.",obama
"Thank you so much. Good afternoon. I am honored to be in the timeless city of Cairo, and tobe hosted by two remarkable institutions. For over a thousand years, Al-Azhar has stood as abeacon of Islamic learning; and for over a century, Cairo University has been a source ofEgypt's advancement. And together, you represent the harmony between tradition andprogress. I'm grateful for your hospitality and the hospitality of the people of Egypt. And I'malso proud to carry with me the goodwill of the American people, and a greeting of peace fromMuslim communities in my country: Assalaamu alaykum [Peace be upon you].We meet at a time of great tension between the United States and Muslims around the world,tension rooted in historical forces that go beyond any current policy debate. The relationshipbetween Islam and the West includes centuries of coexistence and cooperation, but alsoconflict and religious wars. More recently, tension has been fed by colonialism that deniedrights and opportunities to many Muslims, and a Cold War in which Muslim-majority countrieswere too often treated as proxies without regard to their own aspirations. Moreover, thesweeping change brought by modernity and globalization led many Muslims to view the Westas hostile to the traditions of Islam.Violent extremists have exploited these tensions in a small but potent minority ofMuslims. The attacks of September 11, 2001 and the continued efforts of these extremists toengage in violence against civilians has led some in my country to view Islam as inevitablyhostile not only to America and Western countries, but also to human rights. All this has bredmore fear and more mistrust.So long as our relationship is defined by our differences, we will empower those who sowhatred rather than peace, those who promote conflict rather than the cooperation that canhelp all of our people achieve justice and prosperity. And this cycle of suspicion and discordmust end.I've come here to Cairo to seek a new beginning between the United States and Muslimsaround the world, one based on mutual interest and mutual respect, and one based upon thetruth that America and Islam are not exclusive and need not be in competition. Instead, theyoverlap and share common principles -- principles of justice and progress, tolerance and thedignity of all human beings.I do so recognizing that change cannot happen overnight. I know there's been a lot ofpublicity about this speech, but no single speech can eradicate years of mistrust, nor can Ianswer in the time that I have this afternoon all the complex questions that brought us to thispoint. But I am convinced that in order to move forward, we must say openly to each otherthe things we hold in our hearts and that too often are said only behind closed doors. Theremust be a sustained effort to listen to each other, to learn from each other, to respect oneanother, and to seek common ground. As the Holy Quran tells us, ""Be conscious of God andspeak always the truth."" That is what I will try to do today -- to speak the truth as best I can,humbled by the task before us, and firm in my belief that the interests we share as humanbeings are far more powerful than the forces that drive us apart.Now part of this conviction is rooted in my own experience. I'm a Christian, but my fathercame from a Kenyan family that includes generations of Muslims.  As a boy, I spent severalyears in Indonesia and heard the call of the azaan at the break of dawn and at the fall ofdusk.  As a young man, I worked in Chicago communities where many found dignity andpeace in their Muslim faith.As a student of history, I also know civilization's debt to Islam. It was Islam -- at places likeAl-Azhar -- that carried the light of learning through so many centuries, paving the way forEurope's Renaissance and Enlightenment. It was innovation in Muslim communities thatdeveloped the order of algebra, our magnetic compass and tools of navigation, our mastery ofpens and printing, our understanding of how disease spreads and how it can behealed. Islamic culture has given us majestic arches and soaring spires; timeless poetry andcherished music; elegant calligraphy and places of peaceful contemplation. And throughouthistory, Islam has demonstrated through words and deeds the possibilities of religioustolerance and racial equality.I also know that Islam has always been a part of America's story. The first nation to recognizemy country was Morocco. In signing the Treaty of Tripoli in 1796, our second President, JohnAdams, wrote, ""The United States has in itself no character of enmity against the laws,religion, or tranquility of Muslims."" And since our founding, American Muslims have enrichedthe United States.They have fought in our wars; they have served in our government; they have stood for civilrights; they have started businesses; they have taught at our universities; they've excelled inour sports arenas; they've won Nobel Prizes, built our tallest building, and lit the OlympicTorch.  And when the first Muslim American was recently elected to Congress, he took theoath to defend our Constitution using the same Holy Quran that one of our Founding Fathers -- Thomas Jefferson -- kept in his personal library.So I have known Islam on three continents before coming to the region where it was firstrevealed. That experience guides my conviction that partnership between America and Islammust be based on what Islam is, not what it isn't. And I consider it part of my responsibility asPresident of the United States to fight against negative stereotypes of Islam wherever theyappear.But, that same principle must apply to Muslim perceptions of America. Just as Muslims do notfit a crude stereotype, America is not the crude stereotype of a self-interested empire. TheUnited States has been one of the greatest sources of progress that the world has everknown. We were born out of revolution against an empire. We were founded upon the idealthat all are created equal. And we have shed blood and struggled for centuries to givemeaning to those words -- within our borders and around the world. We are shaped by everyculture, drawn from every end of the Earth, and dedicated to a simple concept: E pluribusunum -- ""Out of many, one.""Now much has been made of the fact that an African American with the name Barack HusseinObama could be elected President. But my personal story is not so unique. The dream ofopportunity for all people has not come true for everyone in America, but its promise existsfor all who come to our shores -- and that includes nearly 7 million American Muslims in ourcountry today who, by the way, enjoy incomes and educational levels that are higher than theAmerican average.Moreover, freedom in America is indivisible from the freedom to practice one's religion. That iswhy there is a mosque in every state in our union, and over 1200 mosques within ourborders.  That's why the United States government has gone to court to protect the right ofwomen and girls to wear the hijab -- and to punish those who would deny it.So let there be no doubt: Islam is a part of America. And I believe that America holds withinher the truth that regardless of race, religion, or station in life, all of us share commonaspirations -- to live in peace and security; to get an education and to work with dignity; tolove our families, our communities, and our God. These things we share. This is the hope ofall humanity.Of course, recognizing our common humanity is only the beginning of our task. Words alonecannot meet the needs of our people. These needs will be met only if we act boldly in theyears ahead, and if we understand that the challenges we face are shared and our failure tomeet them will hurt us all.For we have learned from recent experience that when a financial system weakens in onecountry, prosperity is hurt everywhere. When a new flu infects one human being, all are atrisk.  When one nation pursues a nuclear weapon, the risk of nuclear attack rises for allnations.  When violent extremists operate in one stretch of mountains, people are endangeredacross an ocean. When innocents in Bosnia and Darfur are slaughtered, that is a stain on ourcollective conscience. That is what it means to share this world in the 21st century. That is theresponsibility we have to one another as human beings.And this is a difficult responsibility to embrace. For human history has often been a record ofnations and tribes -- and, yes, religions -- subjugating one another in pursuit of their owninterests. Yet in this new age, such attitudes are self-defeating. Given our interdependence,any world order that elevates one nation or group of people over another will inevitablyfail. So whatever we think of the past, we must not be prisoners to it. Our problems must bedealt with through partnership; our progress must be shared. Now, that does not mean weshould ignore sources of tension. Indeed, it suggests the opposite:  We must face thesetensions squarely. And so in that spirit, let me speak as clearly and as plainly as I can aboutsome specific issues that I believe we must finally confront together. The first issue that we have to confront is violent extremism in all of its forms.In Ankara, I made clear that America is not -- and never will be -- at war with Islam. We will,however, relentlessly confront violent extremists who pose a grave threat to our security --because we reject the same thing that people of all faiths reject: the killing of innocent men,women, and children. And it is my first duty as President to protect the American people.The situation in Afghanistan demonstrates America's goals, and our need to worktogether. Over seven years ago, the United States pursued al Qaeda and the Taliban withbroad international support. We did not go by choice; we went because of necessity. I'maware that there's still some who would question or even justify the events of 9/11. But let usbe clear: Al Qaeda killed nearly 3,000 people on that day. The victims were innocent men,women, and children from America and many other nations who had done nothing to harmanybody. And yet al Qaeda chose to ruthlessly murder these people, claimed credit for theattack, and even now states their determination to kill on a massive scale. They have affiliatesin many countries and are trying to expand their reach. These are not opinions to be debated;these are facts to be dealt with.Now, make no mistake: We do not want to keep our troops in Afghanistan. We seek nomilitary bases there. It is agonizing for America to lose our young men and women.  It iscostly and politically difficult to continue this conflict. We would gladly bring every single oneof our troops home if we could be confident that there were not violent extremists inAfghanistan and now Pakistan determined to kill as many Americans as they possibly can. Butthat is not yet the case.And that's why we're partnering with a coalition of 46 countries. And despite the costsinvolved, America's commitment will not weaken. Indeed, none of us should tolerate theseextremists.  They have killed in many countries. They have killed people of different faiths.But more than any other, they have killed Muslims. Their actions are irreconcilable with therights of human beings, the progress of nations, and with Islam. The Quran teaches thatwhoever kills an innocent, it is as if he has killed all mankind. And the Holy Quran also saysWhoever saves a person, it is as if he has saved all mankind. The enduring faith of over abillion people is so much bigger than the narrow hatred of a few. Islam is not part of theproblem in combating violent extremism -- it is an important part of promoting peace.Now, we also know that military power alone is not going to solve the problems in Afghanistanand Pakistan. That's why we plan to invest 1.5 billion dollars each year over the next fiveyears to partner with Pakistanis to build schools and hospitals, roads and businesses, andhundreds of millions to help those who've been displaced. That's why we are providing morethan 2.8 billion dollars to help Afghans develop their economy and deliver services that peopledepend on.Let me also address the issue of Iraq. Unlike Afghanistan, Iraq was a war of choice thatprovoked strong differences in my country and around the world. Although I believe that theIraqi people are ultimately better off without the tyranny of Saddam Hussein, I also believethat events in Iraq have reminded America of the need to use diplomacy and buildinternational consensus to resolve our problems whenever possible. Indeed, we can recall thewords of Thomas Jefferson, who said: ""I hope that our wisdom will grow with our power, andteach us that the less we use our power the greater it will be.""Today, America has a dual responsibility: to help Iraq forge a better future; and to leave Iraqto Iraqis. And I have made it clear to the Iraqi people that we pursue no bases, and no claimon their territory or resources. Iraq's sovereignty is its own. And that's why I ordered theremoval of our combat brigades by next August. That is why we will honor our agreement withIraq's democratically elected government to remove combat troops from Iraqi cities by July,and to remove all of our troops from Iraq by 2012. We will help Iraq train its security forcesand develop its economy. But we will support a secure and united Iraq as a partner, and neveras a patron.And finally, just as America can never tolerate violence by extremists, we must never alter orforget our principles. Nine-eleven was an enormous trauma to our country. The fear andanger that it provoked was understandable, but in some cases it led us to act contrary to ourtraditions and our ideals. We are taking concrete actions to change course. I haveunequivocally prohibited the use of torture by the United States, and I have ordered theprison at Guantanamo Bay closed by early next year. So America will defend itself, respectfulof the sovereignty of nations and the rule of law. And we will do so in partnership with Muslimcommunities which are also threatened. The sooner the extremists are isolated andunwelcome in Muslim communities, the sooner we will all be safer.The second major source of tension that we need to discuss is the situation between Israelis,Palestinians, and the Arab world.America's strong bonds with Israel are well known. This bond is unbreakable. It is based uponcultural and historical ties, and the recognition that the aspiration for a Jewish homeland isrooted in a tragic history that cannot be denied.Around the world, the Jewish people were persecuted for centuries, and anti-Semitism inEurope culminated in an unprecedented Holocaust. Tomorrow, I will visit Buchenwald, whichwas part of a network of camps where Jews were enslaved, tortured, shot, and gassed todeath by the Third Reich. Six million Jews were killed -- more than the entire Jewishpopulation of Israel today. Denying that fact is baseless; it is ignorant; and it ishateful. Threatening Israel with destruction, or repeating vile stereotypes about Jews, isdeeply wrong and only serves to evoke in the minds of Israelis this most painful of memorieswhile preventing the peace that the people of this region deserve.On the other hand, it is also undeniable that the Palestinian people -- Muslims and Christians -- has suffered in pursuit of a homeland. For more than 60 years they've endured the pain ofdislocation. Many wait in refugee camps in the West Bank, Gaza, and neighboring lands for alife of peace and security that they have never been able to lead. They endure the dailyhumiliations -- large and small -- that come with occupation. So let there be no doubt: Thesituation for the Palestinian people is intolerable. And America will not turn our backs on thelegitimate Palestinian aspiration for dignity, opportunity, and a state of their own.For decades then, there has been a stalemate: two peoples with legitimate aspirations, eachwith a painful history that makes compromise elusive. It's easy to point fingers -- forPalestinians to point to the displacement brought about by Israel's founding, and for Israelisto point to the constant hostility and attacks throughout its history from within its borders aswell as beyond. But if we see this conflict only from one side or the other, then we will beblind to the truth: The only resolution is for the aspirations of both sides to be met throughtwo states, where Israelis and Palestinians each live in peace and security.That is in Israel's interest, Palestine's interest, America's interest, and the world's interest.And that is why I intend to personally pursue this outcome with all the patience and dedicationthat the task requires. The obligations that the parties have agreed to under the road map areclear. For peace to come, it is time for them -- and all of us -- to live up to our responsibilities.Palestinians must abandon violence. Resistance through violence and killing is wrong and itdoes not succeed. For centuries, black people in America suffered the lash of the whip asslaves and the humiliation of segregation. But it was not violence that won full and equalrights. It was a peaceful and determined insistence upon the ideals at the center of America'sfounding.This same story can be told by people from South Africa to South Asia; from Eastern Europeto Indonesia. It's a story with a simple truth: Violence is a dead end. It is a sign neither ofcourage nor power to shoot rockets at sleeping children, or to blow up old women on abus. That's not how moral authority is claimed; that's how it is surrendered.Now is the time for Palestinians to focus on what they can build. The Palestinian Authoritymust develop its capacity to govern, with institutions that serve the needs of its peoples.Hamas does have support among some Palestinians, but they also have to recognize theyhave responsibilities. To play a role in fulfilling Palestinian aspirations, to unify the Palestinianpeople, Hamas must put an end to violence, recognize past agreements, recognize Israel'sright to exist.At the same time, Israelis must acknowledge that just as Israel's right to exist cannot bedenied, neither can Palestine's. The United States does not accept the legitimacy of continuedIsraeli settlements. This construction violates previous agreements and undermines efforts toachieve peace. It is time for these settlements to stop.And Israel must also live up to its obligation to ensure that Palestinians can live and work anddevelop their society. Just as it devastates Palestinian families, the continuing humanitariancrisis in Gaza does not serve Israel's security; neither does the continuing lack of opportunityin the West Bank. Progress in the daily lives of the Palestinian people must be a critical part ofa road to peace, and Israel must take concrete steps to enable such progress.And finally, the Arab states must recognize that the Arab Peace Initiative was an importantbeginning, but not the end of their responsibilities. The Arab-Israeli conflict should no longerbe used to distract the people of Arab nations from other problems. Instead, it must be acause for action to help the Palestinian people develop the institutions that will sustain theirstate, to recognize Israel's legitimacy, and to choose progress over a self-defeating focus onthe past.America will align our policies with those who pursue peace, and we will say in public what wesay in private to Israelis and Palestinians and Arabs. We cannot impose peace. But privately,many Muslims recognize that Israel will not go away. Likewise, many Israelis recognize theneed for a Palestinian state. It is time for us to act on what everyone knows to be true.Too many tears have been shed. Too much blood has been shed. All of us have aresponsibility to work for the day when the mothers of Israelis and Palestinians can see theirchildren grow up without fear; when the Holy Land of the three great faiths is the place ofpeace that God intended it to be; when Jerusalem is a secure and lasting home for Jews andChristians and Muslims, and a place for all of the children of Abraham to mingle peacefullytogether as in the story of Isra, when Moses, Jesus, and Mohammed, peace be upon them,joined in prayer.The third source of tension is our shared interest in the rights and responsibilities of nationson nuclear weapons.This issue has been a source of tension between the United States and the Islamic Republic ofIran. For many years, Iran has defined itself in part by its opposition to my country, and thereis in fact a tumultuous history between us. In the middle of the Cold War, the United Statesplayed a role in the overthrow of a democratically elected Iranian government. Since theIslamic Revolution, Iran has played a role in acts of hostage-taking and violence against U.S.troops and civilians. This history is well known. Rather than remain trapped in the past, I'vemade it clear to Iran's leaders and people that my country is prepared to move forward. Thequestion now is not what Iran is against, but rather what future it wants to build.I recognize it will be hard to overcome decades of mistrust, but we will proceed with courage,rectitude, and resolve. There will be many issues to discuss between our two countries, andwe are willing to move forward without preconditions on the basis of mutual respect. But it isclear to all concerned that when it comes to nuclear weapons, we have reached a decisivepoint. This is not simply about America's interests. It's about preventing a nuclear arms racein the Middle East that could lead this region and the world down a hugely dangerous path.I understand those who protest that some countries have weapons that others do not. Nosingle nation should pick and choose which nation holds nuclear weapons. And that's why Istrongly reaffirmed America's commitment to seek a world in which no nations hold nuclearweapons.  And any nation -- including Iran -- should have the right to access peaceful nuclearpower if it complies with its responsibilities under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Thatcommitment is at the core of the treaty, and it must be kept for all who fully abide by it. And Iam hopeful that all countries in the region can share in this goal.The fourth issue that I will address is democracy.I know there has been controversy about the promotion of democracy in recent years, andmuch of this controversy is connected to the war in Iraq. So let me be clear: No system ofgovernment can or should be imposed by one nation by any other.That does not lessen my commitment, however, to governments that reflect the will of thepeople. Each nation gives life to this principle in its own way, grounded in the traditions of itsown people. America does not presume to know what is best for everyone, just as we wouldnot presume to pick the outcome of a peaceful election. But I do have an unyielding belief thatall people yearn for certain things: the ability to speak your mind and have a say in how youare governed; confidence in the rule of law and the equal administration of justice;government that is transparent and doesn't steal from the people; the freedom to live as youchoose. These are not just American ideas; they are human rights. And that is why we willsupport them everywhere.Now, there is no straight line to realize this promise. But this much is clear: Governments thatprotect these rights are ultimately more stable, successful, and secure. Suppressing ideasnever succeeds in making them go away. America respects the right of all peaceful and law-abiding voices to be heard around the world, even if we disagree with them. And we willwelcome all elected, peaceful governments -- provided they govern with respect for all theirpeople.This last point is important because there are some who advocate for democracy only whenthey're out of power. Once in power, they are ruthless in suppressing the rights of others. Sono matter where it takes hold, government of the people and by the people sets a singlestandard for all who would hold power: You must maintain your power through consent, notcoercion; you must respect the rights of minorities, and participate with a spirit of toleranceand compromise; you must place the interests of your people and the legitimate workings ofthe political process above your party. Without these ingredients, elections alone do not maketrue democracy.Thank you. The fifth issue that we must address together is religious freedom.Islam has a proud tradition of tolerance. We see it in the history of Andalusia and Cordobaduring the Inquisition. I saw it firsthand as a child in Indonesia, where devout Christiansworshiped freely in an overwhelmingly Muslim country. That is the spirit we need today.People in every country should be free to choose and live their faith based upon thepersuasion of the mind and the heart and the soul. This tolerance is essential for religion tothrive, but it's being challenged in many different ways.Among some Muslims, there's a disturbing tendency to measure one's own faith by therejection of somebody else's faith. The richness of religious diversity must be upheld --whether it is for Maronites in Lebanon or the Copts in Egypt. And if we are being honest, faultlines must be closed among Muslims, as well, as the divisions between Sunni and Shia haveled to tragic violence, particularly in Iraq.Freedom of religion is central to the ability of peoples to live together. We must alwaysexamine the ways in which we protect it. For instance, in the United States, rules oncharitable giving have made it harder for Muslims to fulfill their religious obligation. That's whyI'm committed to working with American Muslims to ensure that they can fulfill zakat.Likewise, it is important for Western countries to avoid impeding Muslim citizens frompracticing religion as they see fit -- for instance, by dictating what clothes a Muslim womanshould wear. We can't disguise hostility towards any religion behind the pretence of liberalism.In fact, faith should bring us together. And that's why we're forging service projects inAmerica to bring together Christians, Muslims, and Jews. That's why we welcome efforts likeSaudi Arabian King Abdullah's interfaith dialogue and Turkey's leadership in the Alliance ofCivilizations. Around the world, we can turn dialogue into interfaith service, so bridgesbetween peoples lead to action -- whether it is combating malaria in Africa, or providing reliefafter a natural disaster. The sixth issue that I want to address is women's rights.I know, and you can tell from this audience, that there is a healthy debate about this issue. Ireject the view of some in the West that a woman who chooses to cover her hair is somehowless equal, but I do believe that a woman who is denied an education is denied equality. And itis no coincidence that countries where women are well educated are far more likely to beprosperous. Now, let me be clear: Issues of women's equality are by no means simply anissue for Islam. In Turkey, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, we've seen Muslim-majoritycountries elect a woman to lead. Meanwhile, the struggle for women's equality continues inmany aspects of American life, and in countries around the world.I am convinced that our daughters can contribute just as much to society as our sons. Ourcommon prosperity will be advanced by allowing all humanity -- men and women -- to reachtheir full potential. I do not believe that women must make the same choices as men in orderto be equal, and I respect those women who choose to live their lives in traditional roles. Butit should be their choice. And that is why the United States will partner with any Muslim-majority country to support expanded literacy for girls, and to help young women pursueemployment through micro-financing that helps people live their dreams.Finally, I want to discuss economic development and opportunity.I know that for many, the face of globalization is contradictory. The Internet and televisioncan bring knowledge and information, but also offensive sexuality and mindless violence intothe home. Trade can bring new wealth and opportunities, but also huge disruptions andchange in communities. In all nations -- including America -- this change can bring fear; fearthat because of modernity we lose control over our economic choices, our politics, and mostimportantly our identities -- those things we most cherish about our communities, ourfamilies, our traditions, and our faith.But I also know that human progress cannot be denied. There need not be contradictionsbetween development and tradition. Countries like Japan and South Korea grew theireconomies enormously while maintaining distinct cultures. The same is true for theastonishing progress within Muslim-majority countries from Kuala Lumpur to Dubai. In ancienttimes and in our times, Muslim communities have been at the forefront of innovation andeducation.And this is important because no development strategy can be based only upon what comesout of the ground, nor can it be sustained while young people are out of work. Many Gulfstates have enjoyed great wealth as a consequence of oil, and some are beginning to focus iton broader development. But all of us must recognize that education and innovation will bethe currency of the 21st century, and in too many Muslim communities there remainsunderinvestment in these areas. I'm emphasizing such investment within my owncountry. And while America in the past has focused on oil and gas when it comes to this partof the world, we now seek a broader engagement.On education, we will expand exchange programs, and increase scholarships, like the one thatbrought my father to America. At the same time, we will encourage more Americans to studyin Muslim communities. And we will match promising Muslim students with internships inAmerica, invest in online learning for teachers and children around the world, and create anew online network, so a young person in Kansas can communicate instantly with a youngperson in Cairo.On economic development, we will create a new corps of business volunteers to partner withcounterparts in Muslim-majority countries. And I will host a summit on entrepreneurship thisyear to identify how we can deepen ties between business leaders, foundations, and socialentrepreneurs in the United States and Muslim communities around the world.On science and technology, we will launch a new fund to support technological development inMuslim-majority countries, and to help transfer ideas to the marketplace so they can createmore jobs. We'll open centers of scientific excellence in Africa, the Middle East and SoutheastAsia, and appoint new science envoys to collaborate on programs that develop new sources ofenergy, create green jobs, digitize records, clean water, grow new crops. Today I'mannouncing a new global effort with the Organization of the Islamic Conference to eradicatepolio. And we will also expand partnerships with Muslim communities to promote child andmaternal health.All these things must be done in partnership. Americans are ready to join with citizens andgovernments; community organizations, religious leaders, and businesses in Muslimcommunities around the world to help our people pursue a better life.Now the issues that I have described will not be easy to address. But we have a responsibilityto join together on behalf of the world that we seek -- a world where extremists no longerthreaten our people, and American troops have come home; a world where Israelis andPalestinians are each secure in a state of their own, and nuclear energy is used for peacefulpurposes; a world where governments serve their citizens, and the rights of all God's childrenare respected. Those are mutual interests. That is the world we seek. But we can only achieveit together.I know there are many, Muslim and non-Muslim, who question whether we can forge this newbeginning. Some are eager to stoke the flames of division, and to stand in the way ofprogress.  Some suggest that it isn't worth the effort -- that we are fated to disagree, andcivilizations are doomed to clash. Many more are simply skeptical that real change canoccur. There's so much fear, so much mistrust that has built up over the years. But if wechoose to be bound by the past, we will never move forward.And I want to particularly say this to young people of every faith, in every country: You, morethan anyone, have the ability to reimagine the world, to remake this world. All of us share thisworld for but a brief moment in time. The question is whether we spend that time focused onwhat pushes us apart, or whether we commit ourselves to an effort -- a sustained effort -- tofind common ground, to focus on the future we seek for our children, and to respect thedignity of all human beings.It's easier to start wars than to end them. It's easier to blame others than to look inward. It'seasier to see what is different about someone than to find the things we share. But we shouldchoose the right path, not just the easy path. There's one rule that lies at the heart of everyreligion -- that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us. This truth transcendsnations and peoples -- a belief that isn't new; that isn't black or white or brown; that isn'tChristian or Muslim or Jew. It's a belief that pulsed in the cradle of civilization, and that stillbeats in the hearts of billions around the world. It's a faith in other people, and it's whatbrought me here today.We have the power to make the world we seek, but only if we have the courage to make anew beginning, keeping in mind what has been written.The Holy Quran tells us: ""O mankind! We have created you male and a female; and we havemade you into nations and tribes so that you may know one another.""The Talmud tells us: ""The whole of the Torah is for the purpose of promoting peace.""The Holy Bible tells us: ""Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God."" The people of the world can live together in peace. We know that is God's vision. Now thatmust be our work here on Earth.Thank you. And may God's peace be upon you. Thank you very much. Thank you.",obama
"Chancellor Merkel and I have just finished our tour here at Buchenwald. I want to thank Dr. VolkhardKnigge, who gave an outstanding account of what we were witnessing. I am particularly grateful to beaccompanied by my friend Elie Wiesel, as well as Mr. Bertrand Herz, both of whom are survivors of thisplace.We saw the area known as Little Camp where Elie and Bertrand were sent as boys. In fact, at the place thatcommemorates this camp, there is a photograph in which we can see a 16-year-old Elie in one of the bunksalong with the others. We saw the ovens of the crematorium, the guard towers, the barbed wire fences, thefoundations of barracks that once held people in the most unimaginable conditions.We saw the memorial to all the survivors -- a steel plate, as Chancellor Merkel said, that is heated to 37degrees Celsius, the temperature of the human body; a reminder -- where people were deemed inhumanbecause of their differences -- of the mark that we all share.Now these sights have not lost their horror with the passage of time. As we were walking up, Elie said, ""ifthese trees could talk."" And there's a certain irony about the beauty of the landscape and the horror thattook place here.More than half a century later, our grief and our outrage over what happened have not diminished. I will notforget what I've seen here today.I've known about this place since I was a boy, hearing stories about my great uncle, who was a very youngman serving in World War II. He was part of the 89th Infantry Division, the first Americans to reach aconcentration camp. They liberated Ohrdruf, one of Buchenwald's sub-camps.And I told this story, he returned from his service in a state of shock saying little and isolating himself formonths on end from family and friends, alone with the painful memories that would not leave his head. Andas we see -- as we saw some of the images here, it's understandable that someone who witnessed whathad taken place here would be in a state of shock.My great uncle's commander, General Eisenhower, understood this impulse to silence. He had seen thepiles of bodies and starving survivors and deplorable conditions that the American soldiers found when theyarrived, and he knew that those who witnessed these things might be too stunned to speak about them orbe able -- be unable to find the words to describe them; that they might be rendered mute in the way mygreat uncle had. And he knew that what had happened here was so unthinkable that after the bodies hadbeen taken away, that perhaps no one would believe it.And that's why he ordered American troops and Germans from the nearby town to tour the camp. He invitedcongressmen and journalists to bear witness and ordered photographs and films to be made. And heinsisted on viewing every corner of these camps so that -- and I quote -- he could ""be in a position to givefirst-hand evidence of these things if ever in the future there develops a tendency to charge theseallegations merely to propaganda.""We are here today because we know this work is not yet finished. To this day, there are those who insistthat the Holocaust never happened -- a denial of fact and truth that is baseless and ignorant and hateful.This place is the ultimate rebuke to such thoughts; a reminder of our duty to confront those who would telllies about our history.Also to this day, there are those who perpetuate every form of intolerance -- racism, anti-Semitism,homophobia, xenophobia, sexism, and more -- hatred that degrades its victims and diminishes us all. In thiscentury, we've seen genocide. We've seen mass graves and the ashes of villages burned to the ground;children used as soldiers and rape used as a weapon of war. This places teaches us that we must be evervigilant about the spread of evil in our own time, that we must reject the false comfort that others' suffering isnot our problem and commit ourselves to resisting those who would subjugate others to serve their owninterests.But as we reflect today on the human capacity for evil and our shared obligation to defy it, we're alsoreminded of the human capacity for good. For amidst the countless acts of cruelty that took place here, weknow that there were many acts of courage and kindness, as well. The Jews who insisted on fasting on YomKippur. The camp cook who hid potatoes in the lining of his prison uniform and distributed them to his fellowinmates, risking his own life to help save theirs. The prisoners who organized a special effort to protect thechildren here, sheltering them from work and giving them extra food. They set up secret classrooms, someof the inmates, and taught history and math and urged the children to think about their future professions.And we were just hearing about the resistance that formed and the irony that the base for the resistancewas in the latrine areas because the guards found it so offensive that they wouldn't go there. And so out ofthe filth, that became a space in which small freedoms could thrive.When the American GIs arrived they were astonished to find more than 900 children still alive, and theyoungest was just three years old. And I'm told that a couple of the prisoners even wrote a Buchenwaldsong that many here sang.Among the lyrics were these: ""...whatever our fate, we will say yes to life, for the day will come when we arefree...in our blood we carry the will to live and in our hearts, in our hearts -- faith.""These individuals never could have known the world would one day speak of this place. They could nothave known that some of them would live to have children and grandchildren who would grow up hearingtheir stories and would return here so many years later to find a museum and memorials and the clock towerset permanently to 3:15, the moment of liberation.They could not have known how the nation of Israel would rise out of the destruction of the Holocaust andthe strong, enduring bonds between that great nation and my own. And they could not have known that oneday an American President would visit this place and speak of them and that he would do so standing sideby side with the German Chancellor in a Germany that is now a vibrant democracy and a valued Americanally.They could not have known these things. But still surrounded by death they willed themselves to hold fast tolife. In their hearts they still had faith that evil would not triumph in the end, that while history is unknowableit arches towards progress, and that the world would one day remember them. And it is now up to us, theliving, in our work, wherever we are, to resist injustice and intolerance and indifference in whatever formsthey may take, and ensure that those who were lost here did not go in vain. It is up to us to redeem thatfaith. It is up to us to bear witness; to ensure that the world continues to note what happened here; toremember all those who survived and all those who perished, and to remember them not just as victims, butalso as individuals who hoped and loved and dreamed just like us.And just as we identify with the victims, it's also important for us I think to remember that the perpetrators ofsuch evil were human, as well, and that we have to guard against cruelty in ourselves. And I want toexpress particular thanks to Chancellor Merkel and the German people, because it's not easy to look intothe past in this way and acknowledge it and make something of it, make a determination that they will standguard against acts like this happening again.Rather than have me end with my remarks I thought it was appropriate to have Elie Wiesel provide somereflection and some thought as he returns here so many years later to the place where his father died.",obama
"Thank you so much. Good afternoon. I am honored to be in the timeless city of Cairo, and tobe hosted by two remarkable institutions. For over a thousand years, Al-Azhar has stood as abeacon of Islamic learning; and for over a century, Cairo University has been a source ofEgypt's advancement. And together, you represent the harmony between tradition andprogress. I'm grateful for your hospitality and the hospitality of the people of Egypt. And I'malso proud to carry with me the goodwill of the American people, and a greeting of peace fromMuslim communities in my country: Assalaamu alaykum [Peace be upon you].We meet at a time of great tension between the United States and Muslims around the world,tension rooted in historical forces that go beyond any current policy debate. The relationshipbetween Islam and the West includes centuries of coexistence and cooperation, but alsoconflict and religious wars. More recently, tension has been fed by colonialism that deniedrights and opportunities to many Muslims, and a Cold War in which Muslim-majority countrieswere too often treated as proxies without regard to their own aspirations. Moreover, thesweeping change brought by modernity and globalization led many Muslims to view the Westas hostile to the traditions of Islam.Violent extremists have exploited these tensions in a small but potent minority ofMuslims. The attacks of September 11, 2001 and the continued efforts of these extremists toengage in violence against civilians has led some in my country to view Islam as inevitablyhostile not only to America and Western countries, but also to human rights. All this has bredmore fear and more mistrust.So long as our relationship is defined by our differences, we will empower those who sowhatred rather than peace, those who promote conflict rather than the cooperation that canhelp all of our people achieve justice and prosperity. And this cycle of suspicion and discordmust end.I've come here to Cairo to seek a new beginning between the United States and Muslimsaround the world, one based on mutual interest and mutual respect, and one based upon thetruth that America and Islam are not exclusive and need not be in competition. Instead, theyoverlap and share common principles -- principles of justice and progress, tolerance and thedignity of all human beings.I do so recognizing that change cannot happen overnight. I know there's been a lot ofpublicity about this speech, but no single speech can eradicate years of mistrust, nor can Ianswer in the time that I have this afternoon all the complex questions that brought us to thispoint. But I am convinced that in order to move forward, we must say openly to each otherthe things we hold in our hearts and that too often are said only behind closed doors. Theremust be a sustained effort to listen to each other, to learn from each other, to respect oneanother, and to seek common ground. As the Holy Quran tells us, ""Be conscious of God andspeak always the truth."" That is what I will try to do today -- to speak the truth as best I can,humbled by the task before us, and firm in my belief that the interests we share as humanbeings are far more powerful than the forces that drive us apart.Now part of this conviction is rooted in my own experience. I'm a Christian, but my fathercame from a Kenyan family that includes generations of Muslims.  As a boy, I spent severalyears in Indonesia and heard the call of the azaan at the break of dawn and at the fall ofdusk.  As a young man, I worked in Chicago communities where many found dignity andpeace in their Muslim faith.As a student of history, I also know civilization's debt to Islam. It was Islam -- at places likeAl-Azhar -- that carried the light of learning through so many centuries, paving the way forEurope's Renaissance and Enlightenment. It was innovation in Muslim communities thatdeveloped the order of algebra, our magnetic compass and tools of navigation, our mastery ofpens and printing, our understanding of how disease spreads and how it can behealed. Islamic culture has given us majestic arches and soaring spires; timeless poetry andcherished music; elegant calligraphy and places of peaceful contemplation. And throughouthistory, Islam has demonstrated through words and deeds the possibilities of religioustolerance and racial equality.I also know that Islam has always been a part of America's story. The first nation to recognizemy country was Morocco. In signing the Treaty of Tripoli in 1796, our second President, JohnAdams, wrote, ""The United States has in itself no character of enmity against the laws,religion, or tranquility of Muslims."" And since our founding, American Muslims have enrichedthe United States. They have fought in our wars; they have served in our government; they have stood for civilrights; they have started businesses; they have taught at our universities; they've excelled inour sports arenas; they've won Nobel Prizes, built our tallest building, and lit the OlympicTorch.  And when the first Muslim American was recently elected to Congress, he took theoath to defend our Constitution using the same Holy Quran that one of our Founding Fathers -- Thomas Jefferson -- kept in his personal library.So I have known Islam on three continents before coming to the region where it was firstrevealed. That experience guides my conviction that partnership between America and Islammust be based on what Islam is, not what it isn't. And I consider it part of my responsibility asPresident of the United States to fight against negative stereotypes of Islam wherever theyappear.But, that same principle must apply to Muslim perceptions of America. Just as Muslims do notfit a crude stereotype, America is not the crude stereotype of a self-interested empire. TheUnited States has been one of the greatest sources of progress that the world has everknown. We were born out of revolution against an empire. We were founded upon the idealthat all are created equal. And we have shed blood and struggled for centuries to givemeaning to those words -- within our borders and around the world. We are shaped by everyculture, drawn from every end of the Earth, and dedicated to a simple concept: E pluribusunum -- ""Out of many, one.""Now much has been made of the fact that an African American with the name Barack HusseinObama could be elected President. But my personal story is not so unique. The dream ofopportunity for all people has not come true for everyone in America, but its promise existsfor all who come to our shores -- and that includes nearly 7 million American Muslims in ourcountry today who, by the way, enjoy incomes and educational levels that are higher than theAmerican average.Moreover, freedom in America is indivisible from the freedom to practice one's religion. That iswhy there is a mosque in every state in our union, and over 1200 mosques within ourborders.  That's why the United States government has gone to court to protect the right ofwomen and girls to wear the hijab -- and to punish those who would deny it.So let there be no doubt: Islam is a part of America. And I believe that America holds withinher the truth that regardless of race, religion, or station in life, all of us share commonaspirations -- to live in peace and security; to get an education and to work with dignity; tolove our families, our communities, and our God. These things we share. This is the hope ofall humanity.Of course, recognizing our common humanity is only the beginning of our task. Words alonecannot meet the needs of our people. These needs will be met only if we act boldly in theyears ahead, and if we understand that the challenges we face are shared and our failure tomeet them will hurt us all.For we have learned from recent experience that when a financial system weakens in onecountry, prosperity is hurt everywhere. When a new flu infects one human being, all are atrisk.  When one nation pursues a nuclear weapon, the risk of nuclear attack rises for allnations.  When violent extremists operate in one stretch of mountains, people are endangeredacross an ocean. When innocents in Bosnia and Darfur are slaughtered, that is a stain on ourcollective conscience. That is what it means to share this world in the 21st century. That is theresponsibility we have to one another as human beings.And this is a difficult responsibility to embrace. For human history has often been a record ofnations and tribes -- and, yes, religions -- subjugating one another in pursuit of their owninterests. Yet in this new age, such attitudes are self-defeating. Given our interdependence,any world order that elevates one nation or group of people over another will inevitablyfail. So whatever we think of the past, we must not be prisoners to it. Our problems must bedealt with through partnership; our progress must be shared. Now, that does not mean weshould ignore sources of tension. Indeed, it suggests the opposite:  We must face thesetensions squarely. And so in that spirit, let me speak as clearly and as plainly as I can aboutsome specific issues that I believe we must finally confront together. The first issue that we have to confront is violent extremism in all of its forms.In Ankara, I made clear that America is not -- and never will be -- at war with Islam. We will,however, relentlessly confront violent extremists who pose a grave threat to our security --because we reject the same thing that people of all faiths reject: the killing of innocent men,women, and children. And it is my first duty as President to protect the American people.The situation in Afghanistan demonstrates America's goals, and our need to worktogether. Over seven years ago, the United States pursued al Qaeda and the Taliban withbroad international support. We did not go by choice; we went because of necessity. I'maware that there's still some who would question or even justify the events of 9/11. But let usbe clear: Al Qaeda killed nearly 3,000 people on that day. The victims were innocent men,women, and children from America and many other nations who had done nothing to harmanybody. And yet al Qaeda chose to ruthlessly murder these people, claimed credit for theattack, and even now states their determination to kill on a massive scale. They have affiliatesin many countries and are trying to expand their reach. These are not opinions to be debated;these are facts to be dealt with.Now, make no mistake: We do not want to keep our troops in Afghanistan. We seek nomilitary bases there. It is agonizing for America to lose our young men and women.  It iscostly and politically difficult to continue this conflict. We would gladly bring every single oneof our troops home if we could be confident that there were not violent extremists inAfghanistan and now Pakistan determined to kill as many Americans as they possibly can. Butthat is not yet the case.And that's why we're partnering with a coalition of 46 countries. And despite the costsinvolved, America's commitment will not weaken. Indeed, none of us should tolerate theseextremists.  They have killed in many countries. They have killed people of different faiths.But more than any other, they have killed Muslims. Their actions are irreconcilable with therights of human beings, the progress of nations, and with Islam. The Quran teaches thatwhoever kills an innocent, it is as if he has killed all mankind. And the Holy Quran also saysWhoever saves a person, it is as if he has saved all mankind. The enduring faith of over abillion people is so much bigger than the narrow hatred of a few. Islam is not part of theproblem in combating violent extremism -- it is an important part of promoting peace.Now, we also know that military power alone is not going to solve the problems in Afghanistanand Pakistan. That's why we plan to invest 1.5 billion dollars each year over the next fiveyears to partner with Pakistanis to build schools and hospitals, roads and businesses, andhundreds of millions to help those who've been displaced. That's why we are providing morethan 2.8 billion dollars to help Afghans develop their economy and deliver services that peopledepend on.Let me also address the issue of Iraq. Unlike Afghanistan, Iraq was a war of choice thatprovoked strong differences in my country and around the world. Although I believe that theIraqi people are ultimately better off without the tyranny of Saddam Hussein, I also believethat events in Iraq have reminded America of the need to use diplomacy and buildinternational consensus to resolve our problems whenever possible. Indeed, we can recall thewords of Thomas Jefferson, who said: ""I hope that our wisdom will grow with our power, andteach us that the less we use our power the greater it will be.""Today, America has a dual responsibility: to help Iraq forge a better future; and to leave Iraqto Iraqis. And I have made it clear to the Iraqi people that we pursue no bases, and no claimon their territory or resources. Iraq's sovereignty is its own. And that's why I ordered theremoval of our combat brigades by next August. That is why we will honor our agreement withIraq's democratically elected government to remove combat troops from Iraqi cities by July,and to remove all of our troops from Iraq by 2012. We will help Iraq train its security forcesand develop its economy. But we will support a secure and united Iraq as a partner, and neveras a patron.And finally, just as America can never tolerate violence by extremists, we must never alter orforget our principles. Nine-eleven was an enormous trauma to our country. The fear andanger that it provoked was understandable, but in some cases it led us to act contrary to ourtraditions and our ideals. We are taking concrete actions to change course. I haveunequivocally prohibited the use of torture by the United States, and I have ordered theprison at Guantanamo Bay closed by early next year. So America will defend itself, respectfulof the sovereignty of nations and the rule of law. And we will do so in partnership with Muslimcommunities which are also threatened. The sooner the extremists are isolated andunwelcome in Muslim communities, the sooner we will all be safer.The second major source of tension that we need to discuss is the situation between Israelis,Palestinians, and the Arab world.America's strong bonds with Israel are well known. This bond is unbreakable. It is based uponcultural and historical ties, and the recognition that the aspiration for a Jewish homeland isrooted in a tragic history that cannot be denied.Around the world, the Jewish people were persecuted for centuries, and anti-Semitism inEurope culminated in an unprecedented Holocaust. Tomorrow, I will visit Buchenwald, whichwas part of a network of camps where Jews were enslaved, tortured, shot, and gassed todeath by the Third Reich. Six million Jews were killed -- more than the entire Jewishpopulation of Israel today. Denying that fact is baseless; it is ignorant; and it ishateful. Threatening Israel with destruction, or repeating vile stereotypes about Jews, isdeeply wrong and only serves to evoke in the minds of Israelis this most painful of memorieswhile preventing the peace that the people of this region deserve.On the other hand, it is also undeniable that the Palestinian people -- Muslims and Christians -- has suffered in pursuit of a homeland. For more than 60 years they've endured the pain ofdislocation. Many wait in refugee camps in the West Bank, Gaza, and neighboring lands for alife of peace and security that they have never been able to lead. They endure the dailyhumiliations -- large and small -- that come with occupation. So let there be no doubt: Thesituation for the Palestinian people is intolerable. And America will not turn our backs on thelegitimate Palestinian aspiration for dignity, opportunity, and a state of their own.For decades then, there has been a stalemate: two peoples with legitimate aspirations, eachwith a painful history that makes compromise elusive. It's easy to point fingers -- forPalestinians to point to the displacement brought about by Israel's founding, and for Israelisto point to the constant hostility and attacks throughout its history from within its borders aswell as beyond. But if we see this conflict only from one side or the other, then we will beblind to the truth: The only resolution is for the aspirations of both sides to be met throughtwo states, where Israelis and Palestinians each live in peace and security.That is in Israel's interest, Palestine's interest, America's interest, and the world's interest.And that is why I intend to personally pursue this outcome with all the patience and dedicationthat the task requires. The obligations that the parties have agreed to under the road map areclear. For peace to come, it is time for them -- and all of us -- to live up to our responsibilities.Palestinians must abandon violence. Resistance through violence and killing is wrong and itdoes not succeed. For centuries, black people in America suffered the lash of the whip asslaves and the humiliation of segregation. But it was not violence that won full and equalrights. It was a peaceful and determined insistence upon the ideals at the center of America'sfounding.This same story can be told by people from South Africa to South Asia; from Eastern Europeto Indonesia. It's a story with a simple truth: Violence is a dead end. It is a sign neither ofcourage nor power to shoot rockets at sleeping children, or to blow up old women on abus. That's not how moral authority is claimed; that's how it is surrendered.Now is the time for Palestinians to focus on what they can build. The Palestinian Authoritymust develop its capacity to govern, with institutions that serve the needs of its peoples.Hamas does have support among some Palestinians, but they also have to recognize theyhave responsibilities. To play a role in fulfilling Palestinian aspirations, to unify the Palestinianpeople, Hamas must put an end to violence, recognize past agreements, recognize Israel'sright to exist.At the same time, Israelis must acknowledge that just as Israel's right to exist cannot bedenied, neither can Palestine's. The United States does not accept the legitimacy of continuedIsraeli settlements. This construction violates previous agreements and undermines efforts toachieve peace. It is time for these settlements to stop.And Israel must also live up to its obligation to ensure that Palestinians can live and work anddevelop their society. Just as it devastates Palestinian families, the continuing humanitariancrisis in Gaza does not serve Israel's security; neither does the continuing lack of opportunityin the West Bank. Progress in the daily lives of the Palestinian people must be a critical part ofa road to peace, and Israel must take concrete steps to enable such progress.And finally, the Arab states must recognize that the Arab Peace Initiative was an importantbeginning, but not the end of their responsibilities. The Arab-Israeli conflict should no longerbe used to distract the people of Arab nations from other problems. Instead, it must be acause for action to help the Palestinian people develop the institutions that will sustain theirstate, to recognize Israel's legitimacy, and to choose progress over a self-defeating focus onthe past.America will align our policies with those who pursue peace, and we will say in public what wesay in private to Israelis and Palestinians and Arabs. We cannot impose peace. But privately,many Muslims recognize that Israel will not go away. Likewise, many Israelis recognize theneed for a Palestinian state. It is time for us to act on what everyone knows to be true.Too many tears have been shed. Too much blood has been shed. All of us have aresponsibility to work for the day when the mothers of Israelis and Palestinians can see theirchildren grow up without fear; when the Holy Land of the three great faiths is the place ofpeace that God intended it to be; when Jerusalem is a secure and lasting home for Jews andChristians and Muslims, and a place for all of the children of Abraham to mingle peacefullytogether as in the story of Isra, when Moses, Jesus, and Mohammed, peace be upon them,joined in prayer.The third source of tension is our shared interest in the rights and responsibilities of nationson nuclear weapons.This issue has been a source of tension between the United States and the Islamic Republic ofIran. For many years, Iran has defined itself in part by its opposition to my country, and thereis in fact a tumultuous history between us. In the middle of the Cold War, the United Statesplayed a role in the overthrow of a democratically elected Iranian government. Since theIslamic Revolution, Iran has played a role in acts of hostage-taking and violence against U.S.troops and civilians. This history is well known. Rather than remain trapped in the past, I'vemade it clear to Iran's leaders and people that my country is prepared to move forward. Thequestion now is not what Iran is against, but rather what future it wants to build.I recognize it will be hard to overcome decades of mistrust, but we will proceed with courage,rectitude, and resolve. There will be many issues to discuss between our two countries, andwe are willing to move forward without preconditions on the basis of mutual respect. But it isclear to all concerned that when it comes to nuclear weapons, we have reached a decisivepoint. This is not simply about America's interests. It's about preventing a nuclear arms racein the Middle East that could lead this region and the world down a hugely dangerous path.I understand those who protest that some countries have weapons that others do not. Nosingle nation should pick and choose which nation holds nuclear weapons. And that's why Istrongly reaffirmed America's commitment to seek a world in which no nations hold nuclearweapons.  And any nation -- including Iran -- should have the right to access peaceful nuclearpower if it complies with its responsibilities under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Thatcommitment is at the core of the treaty, and it must be kept for all who fully abide by it. And Iam hopeful that all countries in the region can share in this goal.The fourth issue that I will address is democracy.I know there has been controversy about the promotion of democracy in recent years, andmuch of this controversy is connected to the war in Iraq. So let me be clear: No system ofgovernment can or should be imposed by one nation by any other.That does not lessen my commitment, however, to governments that reflect the will of thepeople. Each nation gives life to this principle in its own way, grounded in the traditions of itsown people. America does not presume to know what is best for everyone, just as we wouldnot presume to pick the outcome of a peaceful election. But I do have an unyielding belief thatall people yearn for certain things: the ability to speak your mind and have a say in how youare governed; confidence in the rule of law and the equal administration of justice;government that is transparent and doesn't steal from the people; the freedom to live as youchoose. These are not just American ideas; they are human rights. And that is why we willsupport them everywhere.Now, there is no straight line to realize this promise. But this much is clear: Governments thatprotect these rights are ultimately more stable, successful, and secure. Suppressing ideasnever succeeds in making them go away. America respects the right of all peaceful and law-abiding voices to be heard around the world, even if we disagree with them. And we willwelcome all elected, peaceful governments -- provided they govern with respect for all theirpeople.This last point is important because there are some who advocate for democracy only whenthey're out of power. Once in power, they are ruthless in suppressing the rights of others. Sono matter where it takes hold, government of the people and by the people sets a singlestandard for all who would hold power: You must maintain your power through consent, notcoercion; you must respect the rights of minorities, and participate with a spirit of toleranceand compromise; you must place the interests of your people and the legitimate workings ofthe political process above your party. Without these ingredients, elections alone do not maketrue democracy.Thank you. The fifth issue that we must address together is religious freedom.Islam has a proud tradition of tolerance. We see it in the history of Andalusia and Cordobaduring the Inquisition. I saw it firsthand as a child in Indonesia, where devout Christiansworshiped freely in an overwhelmingly Muslim country. That is the spirit we need today.People in every country should be free to choose and live their faith based upon thepersuasion of the mind and the heart and the soul. This tolerance is essential for religion tothrive, but it's being challenged in many different ways.Among some Muslims, there's a disturbing tendency to measure one's own faith by therejection of somebody else's faith. The richness of religious diversity must be upheld --whether it is for Maronites in Lebanon or the Copts in Egypt. And if we are being honest, faultlines must be closed among Muslims, as well, as the divisions between Sunni and Shia haveled to tragic violence, particularly in Iraq.Freedom of religion is central to the ability of peoples to live together. We must alwaysexamine the ways in which we protect it. For instance, in the United States, rules oncharitable giving have made it harder for Muslims to fulfill their religious obligation. That's whyI'm committed to working with American Muslims to ensure that they can fulfill zakat.Likewise, it is important for Western countries to avoid impeding Muslim citizens frompracticing religion as they see fit -- for instance, by dictating what clothes a Muslim womanshould wear. We can't disguise hostility towards any religion behind the pretence of liberalism.In fact, faith should bring us together. And that's why we're forging service projects inAmerica to bring together Christians, Muslims, and Jews. That's why we welcome efforts likeSaudi Arabian King Abdullah's interfaith dialogue and Turkey's leadership in the Alliance ofCivilizations. Around the world, we can turn dialogue into interfaith service, so bridgesbetween peoples lead to action -- whether it is combating malaria in Africa, or providing reliefafter a natural disaster. The sixth issue that I want to address is women's rights.I know, and you can tell from this audience, that there is a healthy debate about this issue. Ireject the view of some in the West that a woman who chooses to cover her hair is somehowless equal, but I do believe that a woman who is denied an education is denied equality. And itis no coincidence that countries where women are well educated are far more likely to beprosperous. Now, let me be clear: Issues of women's equality are by no means simply anissue for Islam. In Turkey, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, we've seen Muslim-majoritycountries elect a woman to lead. Meanwhile, the struggle for women's equality continues inmany aspects of American life, and in countries around the world.I am convinced that our daughters can contribute just as much to society as our sons. Ourcommon prosperity will be advanced by allowing all humanity -- men and women -- to reachtheir full potential. I do not believe that women must make the same choices as men in orderto be equal, and I respect those women who choose to live their lives in traditional roles. Butit should be their choice. And that is why the United States will partner with any Muslim-majority country to support expanded literacy for girls, and to help young women pursueemployment through micro-financing that helps people live their dreams.Finally, I want to discuss economic development and opportunity.I know that for many, the face of globalization is contradictory. The Internet and televisioncan bring knowledge and information, but also offensive sexuality and mindless violence intothe home. Trade can bring new wealth and opportunities, but also huge disruptions andchange in communities. In all nations -- including America -- this change can bring fear; fearthat because of modernity we lose control over our economic choices, our politics, and mostimportantly our identities -- those things we most cherish about our communities, ourfamilies, our traditions, and our faith.But I also know that human progress cannot be denied. There need not be contradictionsbetween development and tradition. Countries like Japan and South Korea grew theireconomies enormously while maintaining distinct cultures. The same is true for theastonishing progress within Muslim-majority countries from Kuala Lumpur to Dubai. In ancienttimes and in our times, Muslim communities have been at the forefront of innovation andeducation.And this is important because no development strategy can be based only upon what comesout of the ground, nor can it be sustained while young people are out of work. Many Gulfstates have enjoyed great wealth as a consequence of oil, and some are beginning to focus iton broader development. But all of us must recognize that education and innovation will bethe currency of the 21st century, and in too many Muslim communities there remainsunderinvestment in these areas. I'm emphasizing such investment within my owncountry. And while America in the past has focused on oil and gas when it comes to this partof the world, we now seek a broader engagement.On education, we will expand exchange programs, and increase scholarships, like the one thatbrought my father to America. At the same time, we will encourage more Americans to studyin Muslim communities. And we will match promising Muslim students with internships inAmerica, invest in online learning for teachers and children around the world, and create anew online network, so a young person in Kansas can communicate instantly with a youngperson in Cairo.On economic development, we will create a new corps of business volunteers to partner withcounterparts in Muslim-majority countries. And I will host a summit on entrepreneurship thisyear to identify how we can deepen ties between business leaders, foundations, and socialentrepreneurs in the United States and Muslim communities around the world.On science and technology, we will launch a new fund to support technological development inMuslim-majority countries, and to help transfer ideas to the marketplace so they can createmore jobs. We'll open centers of scientific excellence in Africa, the Middle East and SoutheastAsia, and appoint new science envoys to collaborate on programs that develop new sources ofenergy, create green jobs, digitize records, clean water, grow new crops. Today I'mannouncing a new global effort with the Organization of the Islamic Conference to eradicatepolio. And we will also expand partnerships with Muslim communities to promote child andmaternal health.All these things must be done in partnership. Americans are ready to join with citizens andgovernments; community organizations, religious leaders, and businesses in Muslimcommunities around the world to help our people pursue a better life.Now the issues that I have described will not be easy to address. But we have a responsibilityto join together on behalf of the world that we seek -- a world where extremists no longerthreaten our people, and American troops have come home; a world where Israelis andPalestinians are each secure in a state of their own, and nuclear energy is used for peacefulpurposes; a world where governments serve their citizens, and the rights of all God's childrenare respected. Those are mutual interests. That is the world we seek. But we can only achieveit together.I know there are many, Muslim and non-Muslim, who question whether we can forge this newbeginning. Some are eager to stoke the flames of division, and to stand in the way ofprogress.  Some suggest that it isn't worth the effort -- that we are fated to disagree, andcivilizations are doomed to clash. Many more are simply skeptical that real change canoccur. There's so much fear, so much mistrust that has built up over the years. But if wechoose to be bound by the past, we will never move forward.And I want to particularly say this to young people of every faith, in every country: You, morethan anyone, have the ability to reimagine the world, to remake this world. All of us share thisworld for but a brief moment in time. The question is whether we spend that time focused onwhat pushes us apart, or whether we commit ourselves to an effort -- a sustained effort -- tofind common ground, to focus on the future we seek for our children, and to respect thedignity of all human beings.It's easier to start wars than to end them. It's easier to blame others than to look inward. It'seasier to see what is different about someone than to find the things we share. But we shouldchoose the right path, not just the easy path. There's one rule that lies at the heart of everyreligion -- that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us. This truth transcendsnations and peoples -- a belief that isn't new; that isn't black or white or brown; that isn'tChristian or Muslim or Jew. It's a belief that pulsed in the cradle of civilization, and that stillbeats in the hearts of billions around the world. It's a faith in other people, and it's whatbrought me here today.We have the power to make the world we seek, but only if we have the courage to make anew beginning, keeping in mind what has been written.The Holy Quran tells us: ""O mankind! We have created you male and a female; and we havemade you into nations and tribes so that you may know one another.""The Talmud tells us: ""The whole of the Torah is for the purpose of promoting peace.""The Holy Bible tells us: ""Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God."" The people of the world can live together in peace. We know that is God's vision. Now thatmust be our work here on Earth.Thank you. And may God's peace be upon you. Thank you very much. Thank you.",obama
"Good afternoon.  Thank you, President Sarkozy, Prime Minister Brown, Prime Minister Harper,and Prince Charles for being here today.  Thank you to our Secretary of Veterans Affairs,General Eric Shinseki, for making the trip out here to join us.  Thanks also to SusanEisenhower, whose grandfather began this mission 65 years ago with a simple charge: ""Ok,let's go.""  And to a World War II veteran who returned home from this war to serve a proudand distinguished career as a United States Senator and a national leader:  Bob Dole.I'm not the first American President to come and mark this anniversary, and I likely will not bethe last.  This is an event that has long brought to this coast both heads of state and gratefulcitizens; veterans and their loved ones; the liberated and their liberators.  It's been writtenabout and spoken of and depicted in countless books and films and speeches.  And long afterour time on this Earth has passed, one word will still bring forth the pride and awe of men andwomen who will never meet the heroes who sit before us:  D-Day.Why is this?  Of all the battles in all the wars across the span of human history, why does thisday hold such a revered place in our memory?  What is it about the struggle that took placeon the sands a few short steps from here that brings us back to remember year after yearafter year?Part of it, I think, is the size of the odds that weighed against success.  For three centuries, noinvader had ever been able to cross the English Channel into Normandy.  And it had neverbeen more difficult than in 1944.That was the year that Hitler ordered his top field marshal to fortify the Atlantic Wall against aseaborne invasion.  From the tip of Norway to southern France, the Nazis lined steep cliffswith machine guns and artillery.  Low-lying areas were flooded to block passage.  Sharpenedpoles awaited paratroopers.  Mines were laid on the beaches and beneath the water.  And bythe time of the invasion, half a million Germans waited for the Allies along the coast betweenHolland and northern France.At dawn on June 6th, the Allies came.  The best chance for victory had been for the BritishRoyal Air Corps to take out the guns on the cliffs while airborne divisions parachuted behindenemy lines.  But all did not go according to plan.  Paratroopers landed miles from their mark,while the fog and clouds prevented Allied planes from destroying the guns on the cliffs.  Sowhen the ships landed here at Omaha, an unimaginable hell rained down on the men inside. Many never made it out of the boats.And yet, despite all of this, one by one, the Allied forces made their way to shore -- here, andat Utah and Juno; Gold and Sword.  They were American, British, and Canadian.  Soon, theparatroopers found each other and fought their way back.  The Rangers scaled the cliffs.  Andby the end of the day, against all odds, the ground on which we stand was free once more.The sheer improbability of this victory is part of what makes D-Day so memorable.  It alsoarises from the clarity of purpose with which this war was waged.We live in a world of competing beliefs and claims about what is true.  It's a world of variedreligions and cultures and forms of government.  In such a world, it's all too rare for astruggle to emerge that speaks to something universal about humanity.The Second World War did that.  No man who shed blood or lost a brother would say that waris good.  But all know that this war was essential.  For what we faced in Nazi totalitarianismwas not just a battle of competing interests.  It was a competing vision of humanity.  Naziideology sought to subjugate and humiliate and exterminate.  It perpetrated murder on amassive scale, fueled by a hatred of those who were deemed different and therefore inferior. It was evil.The nations that joined together to defeat Hitler's Reich were not perfect.  They had madetheir share of mistakes, had not always agreed with one another on every issue.  Butwhatever God we prayed to, whatever our differences, we knew that the evil we faced had tobe stopped.  Citizens of all faiths and of no faith came to believe that we could not remain asbystanders to the savage perpetration of death and destruction.  And so we joined and sentour sons to fight and often die so that men and women they never met might know what it isto be free.In America, it was an endeavor that inspired a nation to action.  A President who asked hiscountry to pray on D-Day also asked its citizens to serve and sacrifice to make the invasionpossible.On farms and in factories, millions of men and women worked three shifts a day, month aftermonth, year after year.  Trucks and tanks came from plants in Michigan and Indiana, NewYork and Illinois.  Bombers and fighter planes rolled off assembly lines in Ohio and Kansas,where my grandmother did her part as an inspector.  Shipyards on both coasts produced thelargest fleet in history, including the landing craft from New Orleans that eventually made ithere to Omaha.But despite all the years of planning and preparation, despite the inspiration of our leaders,the skill of our generals, the strength of our firepower and the unyielding support from ourhome front, the outcome of the entire struggle would ultimately rest on the success of oneday in June.Lyndon Johnson once said that there are certain moments when ""history and fate meet at asingle time in a single place to shape a turning point in man's unending search for freedom.""D-Day was such a moment.  One newspaper noted that ""we have come to the hour for whichwe were born.""  Had the Allies failed here, Hitler's occupation of this continent might havecontinued indefinitely.  Instead, victory here secured a foothold in France.  It opened a path toBerlin.  It made possible the achievements that followed the liberation of Europe:  theMarshall Plan, the NATO alliance, the shared prosperity and security that flowed from each.It was unknowable then, but so much of the progress that would define the 20th century, onboth sides of the Atlantic, came down to the battle for a slice of beach only six miles long andtwo miles wide.More particularly, it came down to the men who landed here -- those who now rest in thisplace for eternity, and those who are with us here today.  Perhaps more than any otherreason, you, the veterans of that landing, are why we still remember what happened on D-Day.  You're why we keep coming back.For you remind us that in the end, human destiny is not determined by forces beyond ourcontrol.  You remind us that our future is not shaped by mere chance or circumstance.  Ourhistory has always been the sum total of the choices made and the actions taken by eachindividual man and woman.  It has always been up to us.You could have done what Hitler believed you would do when you arrived here.  In the face ofa merciless assault from these cliffs, you could have idled the boats offshore.  Amid a barrageof tracer bullets that lit the night sky, you could have stayed in those planes.  You could havehid in the hedgerows or waited behind the seawall.  You could have done only what wasnecessary to ensure your own survival.But that's not what you did.  That's not the story you told on D-Day.  Your story was writtenby men like Zane Schlemmer of the 82nd Airborne, who parachuted into a dark marsh, farfrom his objective and his men.Lost and alone, he still managed to fight his way through the gunfire and help liberate thetown in which he landed -- a town where a street now bears his name.It's a story written by men like Anthony Ruggiero, an Army Ranger who saw half the men onhis landing craft drown when it was hit by shellfire just a thousand yards off this beach.  Hespent three hours in freezing water, and was one of only 90 Rangers to survive out of the 225who were sent to scale the cliffs.And it's a story written by so many who are no longer with us, like Carlton Barrett.  PrivateBarrett was only supposed to serve as a guide for the 1st Infantry Division, but he insteadbecame one of its heroes.  After wading ashore in neck-deep water, he returned to the wateragain and again and again to save his wounded and drowning comrades.  And under theheaviest possible enemy fire, he carried them to safety.  He carried them in his own arms.This is the story of the Allied victory.  It's the legend of units like Easy Company and the All-American 82nd.  It's the tale of the British people, whose courage during the Blitz forced Hitlerto call off the invasion of England; the Canadians, who came even though they were neverattacked; the Russians, who sustained some of the war's heaviest casualties on the Easternfront; and all those French men and women who would rather have died resisting tyrannythan lived within its grasp.It is the memories that have been passed on to so many of us about the service or sacrifice ofa friend or relative.  For me, it is my grandfather, Stanley Dunham, who arrived on this beachsix weeks after D-Day and marched across Europe in Patton's Army.  And it is my great unclewho was part of the first American division to reach and liberate a Nazi concentration camp. His name is Charles Payne, and I'm so proud that he's with us here today.I know this trip doesn't get any easier as the years pass, but for those of you who make it,there's nothing that could keep you away.  One such veteran, a man named Jim Norene, wasa member of the 502nd Parachute Infantry Division of the 101st Airborne.  Last night, aftervisiting this cemetery for one last time, he passed away in his sleep.  Jim was gravely ill whenhe left his home, and he knew that he might not return.  But just as he did 65 years ago, hecame anyway.  May he now rest in peace with the boys he once bled with, and may his familyalways find solace in the heroism he showed here.In the end, Jim Norene came back to Normandy for the same reason we all come back.  Hecame for the reason articulated by Howard Huebner, another former paratrooper who is herewith us today.  When asked why he made the trip, Howard said, ""It's important that we tellour stories.  It doesn't have to be something bigjust a little story about what happened -- sopeople don't forget.""So people don't forget.Friends and veterans, we cannot forget.  What we must not forget is that D-Day was a timeand a place where the bravery and the selflessness of a few was able to change the course ofan entire century.  At an hour of maximum danger, amid the bleakest of circumstances, menwho thought themselves ordinary found within themselves the ability to do somethingextraordinary.  They fought for their moms and sweethearts back home, for the fellowwarriors they came to know as brothers.  And they fought out of a simple sense of duty -- aduty sustained by the same ideals for which their countrymen had once fought and bled forover two centuries.That is the story of Normandy -- but also the story of America; of the Minutemen whogathered on a green in Lexington; of the Union boys from Maine who repelled a charge atGettysburg; of the men who gave their last full measure of devotion at Inchon and Khe San;of all the young men and women whose valor and goodness still carry forward this legacy ofservice and sacrifice.  It's a story that has never come easy, but one that always gives ushope.  For as we face down the hardships and struggles of our time, and arrive at that hourfor which we were born, we cannot help but draw strength from those moments in historywhen the best among us were somehow able to swallow their fears and secure a beachheadon an unforgiving shore.To those men who achieved that victory 65 years ago, we thank you for your service.May God bless you, and may God bless the memory of all those who rest here.",obama
"Let me begin by thanking Nancy for the wonderful introduction. I want to thank Dr. JosephHeyman, the chair of the Board of Trustees, as well as Dr. Jeremy Lazarus, speaker of Houseof Delegates. Thanks to all of you for bringing me home, even if it's just for a day.From the moment I took office as President, the central challenge we've confronted as anation has been the need to lift ourselves out of the worst recession since World War II. Inrecent months, we've taken a series of extraordinary steps, not just to repair the immediatedamage to our economy, but to build a new foundation for lasting and sustained growth.We're here to create new jobs, to unfreeze our credit markets. We're stemming the loss ofhomes and the decline of home values.All this is important. But even as we've made progress, we know that the road to prosperityremains long and it remains difficult. And we also know that one essential step on our journeyis to control the spiraling cost of health care in America. And in order to do that, we're goingto need the help of the AMA.Today, we are spending over $2 trillion a year on health care -- almost 50 percent more perperson than the next most costly nation. And yet, as I think many of you are aware, for all ofthis spending, more of our citizens are uninsured, the quality of our care is often lower, andwe aren't any healthier. In fact, citizens in some countries that spend substantially less thanwe do are actually living longer than we do.Make no mistake: The cost of our health care is a threat to our economy. It's an escalatingburden on our families and businesses. It's a ticking time bomb for the federal budget. And itis unsustainable for the United States of America.It's unsustainable for Americans like Laura Klitzka, a young mother that I met in Wisconsinjust last week, who's learned that the breast cancer she thought she'd beaten had spread toher bones, but who's now being forced to spend time worrying about how to cover the$50,000 in medical debts she's already accumulated, worried about future debts that she'sgoing to accumulate, when all she wants to do is spend time with her two children and focuson getting well. These are not the worries that a woman like Laura should have to face in anation as wealthy as ours.Stories like Laura's are being told by women and men all across this country -- by familieswho've seen out-of-pocket costs soar, and premiums double over the last decade at a ratethree times faster than wages. This is forcing Americans of all ages to go without thecheckups or the prescriptions they need -- that you know they need. It's creating a situationwhere a single illness can wipe out a lifetime of savings.Our costly health care system is unsustainable for doctors like Michael Kahn in NewHampshire, who, as he puts it, spends 20 percent of each day supervising a staff explaininginsurance problems to patients, completing authorization forms, writing appeal letters -- aroutine that he calls disruptive and distracting, giving him less time to do what he became adoctor to do and actually care for his patients.Small business owners like Chris and Becky Link in Nashville are also struggling. They'vealways wanted to do right by the workers at their family-run marketing firm, but they'verecently had to do the unthinkable and lay off a number of employees -- layoffs that couldhave been deferred, they say, if health care costs weren't so high. Across the country, overone-third of small businesses have reduced benefits in recent years and one-third havedropped their workers' coverage altogether since the early '90s.Our largest companies are suffering, as well. A big part of what led General Motors andChrysler into trouble in recent decades were the huge costs they racked up providing healthcare for their workers -- costs that made them less profitable and less competitive withautomakers around the world. If we do not fix our health care system, America may go theway of GM -- paying more, getting less, and going broke.When it comes to the cost of our health care, then, the status quo is unsustainable. So reformis not a luxury; it is a necessity. When I hear people say, well, why are you taking this onright now, you've got all these other problems, I keep on reminding people I'd love to be ableto defer these issues, but we can't. I know there's been much discussion about what reformwould cost, and rightly so. This is a test of whether we -- Democrats and Republicans alike --are serious about holding the line on new spending and restoring fiscal discipline.But let there be no doubt -- the cost of inaction is greater. If we fail to act -- if we fail to act --and you know this because you see it in your own individual practices -- if we fail to act,premiums will climb higher, benefits will erode further, the rolls of the uninsured will swell toinclude millions more Americans -- all of which will affect your practice.If we fail to act, one out of every five dollars we earn will be spent on health care within adecade. And in 30 years, it will be about one out of every three -- a trend that will mean lostjobs, lower take-home pay, shuttered businesses, and a lower standard of living for allAmericans.And if we fail to act, federal spending on Medicaid and Medicare will grow over the comingdecades by an amount almost equal to the amount our government currently spends on ournation's defense. It will, in fact, eventually grow larger than what our government spends onanything else today. It's a scenario that will swamp our federal and state budgets, and imposea vicious choice of either unprecedented tax hikes, or overwhelming deficits, or drastic cuts inour federal and state budgets.So to say it as plainly as I can, health care is the single most important thing we can do forAmerica's long-term fiscal health. That is a fact. That's a fact.It's a fact, and the truth is most people know that it's a fact. And yet, as clear as it is that oursystem badly needs reform, reform is not inevitable. There's a sense out there among some,and perhaps some members who are gathered here today of the AMA, that as bad as ourcurrent system may be -- and it's pretty bad -- the devil we know is better than the devil wedon't. There's a fear of change -- a worry that we may lose what works about our health caresystem while trying to fix what doesn't.I'm here to tell you I understand that fear. And I understand the cynicism. They're scars leftover from past efforts at reform. After all, Presidents have called for health care reform fornearly a century. Teddy Roosevelt called for it. Harry Truman called for it. Richard Nixoncalled for it. Jimmy Carter called for it. Bill Clinton called for it. But while significant individualreforms have been made -- such as Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's Health InsuranceProgram -- efforts at comprehensive reform that covers everyone and brings down costs havelargely failed.Part of the reason is because the different groups involved -- doctors, insurance companies,businesses, workers, and others -- simply couldn't agree on the need for reform or whatshape it would take. And if we're honest, another part of the reason has been the fierceopposition fueled by some interest groups and lobbyists -- opposition that has used feartactics to paint any effort to achieve reform as an attempt to, yes, socialize medicine.And despite this long history of failure, I'm standing here because I think we're in a differenttime.One sign that things are different is that just this past week, the Senate passed a bill that willprotect children from the dangers of smoking, a reform the AMA has long championed -- thisorganization long championed; it went nowhere when it was proposed a decade ago -- I'mgoing to sign this into law. Now, what makes this moment different is that this time -- for the first time -- keystakeholders are aligning not against, but in favor of reform. They're coming out -- they'recoming together out of a recognition that while reform will take everyone in our health carecommunity to do their part -- everybody is going to have to pitch in -- ultimately, everybodywill benefit.And I want to commend the AMA, in particular, for offering to do your part to curb costs andachieve reform. Just a week ago, you joined together with hospitals, labor unions, insurers,medical device manufacturers and drug companies to do something that would have beenunthinkable just a few years ago -- you promised to work together to cut national health carespending by $2 trillion over the next decade, relative to what it would have otherwise been.And that will bring down costs; that will bring down premiums. That's exactly the kind ofcooperation we need, and we appreciate that very much. Thank you.Now, the question is how do we finish the job? How do we permanently bring down costs andmake quality, affordable health care available to every single American? That's what I've cometo talk about today. We know the moment is right for health care reform. We know this is ahistoric opportunity we've never seen before and may not see again. But we also know thatthere are those who will try and scuttle this opportunity no matter what -- who will use thesame scare tactics and fear-mongering that's worked in the past; who will give warningsabout socialized medicine and government takeovers, long lines and rationed care, decisionsmade by bureaucrats and not doctors. We have heard this all before. And because these feartactics have worked, things have kept getting worse.So let me begin by saying this to you and to the American people: I know that there aremillions of Americans who are content with their health care coverage -- they like their planand, most importantly, they value their relationship with their doctor. They trust you. And thatmeans that no matter how we reform health care, we will keep this promise to the Americanpeople: If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor, period. If you like yourhealth care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan, period. No one will take it away,no matter what. My view is that health care reform should be guided by a simple principle: Fixwhat's broken and build on what works. And that's what we intend to do.If we do that, we can build a health care system that allows you to be physicians instead ofadministrators and accountants; a system that gives Americans -- a system that givesAmericans the best care at the lowest cost; a system that eases up the pressure onbusinesses and unleashes the promise of our economy, creating hundreds of thousands ofjobs, making take-home wages thousands of dollars higher, and growing our economy by tensof billions of dollars more every year.That's how we'll stop spending tax dollars to prop up an unsustainable system, and startinvesting those dollars in innovations and advances that will make our health care system andour economy stronger. That's what we can do with this opportunity. And that's what we mustdo with this moment.Now, the good news is that in some instances, there's already widespread agreement on thesteps necessary to make our health care system work better. First, we need to upgrade ourmedical records by switching from a paper to an electronic system of record keeping. Andwe've already begun to do this with an investment we made as part of our Recovery Act.It simply doesn't make sense that patients in the 21st century are still filling out forms withpens on papers that have to be stored away somewhere. As Newt Gingrich has rightly pointedout -- and I don't quote Newt Gingrich that often -- we do a better job tracking a FedExpackage in this country than we do tracking patients' health records.You shouldn't have to tell every new doctor you see about your medical history or whatprescriptions you're taking. You shouldn't have to repeat costly tests. All that informationshould be stored securely in a private medical record so that your information can be trackedfrom one doctor to another -- even if you change jobs, even if you move, even if you have tosee a number of different specialists. That's just common sense.And that will not only mean less paper-pushing and lower administrative costs, savingtaxpayers billions of dollars; it will also mean all of you physicians will have an easier timedoing your jobs. It will tell you, the doctors, what drugs a patient is taking so you can avoidprescribing a medication that could cause a harmful interaction. It will prevent the wrongdosages from going to a patient. It will reduce medical errors, it's estimated, that lead to100,000 lives lost unnecessarily in our hospitals every year.So there shouldn't be an argument there. And we want to make sure that we're helpingproviders computerize so that we can get this system up and running.The second step that we can all agree on is to invest more in preventive care so we can avoidillness and disease in the first place. That starts with each of us taking more responsibility forour health and for the health of our children. It means quitting smoking. It means going in forthat mammogram or colon cancer screening. It means going for a run or hitting the gym, andraising our children to step away from the video games and spend more time playing outside.It also means cutting down on all the junk food that's fueling an epidemic of obesity -- whichputs far too many Americans, young and old, at greater risk of costly, chronic conditions.That's a lesson Michelle and I have tried to instill in our daughters. As some of you know, westarted a White House vegetable garden. I say ""we"" generously, because Michelle has donemost of the work. That's a lesson that we should work with local school districts to incorporateinto their school lunch programs.Building a health care system that promotes prevention rather than just managing diseaseswill require all of us to do our parts. It will take doctors telling us what risk factors we shouldavoid and what preventive measures we should pursue. It will take employers following theexample of places like Safeway that is rewarding workers for taking better care of their healthwhile reducing health care costs in the process.If you're one of three-quarters of Safeway workers enrolled in their ""Healthy Measures""program, you can get screened for problems like high cholesterol or high blood pressure. Andif you score well, you can pay lower premiums; you get more money in your paycheck. It's aprogram that has helped Safeway cut health care spending by 13 percent, and workers saveover 20 percent on their premiums. And we're open to doing more to help employers adoptand expand programs like this one.Our federal government also has to step up its efforts to advance the cause of healthy living.Five of the costliest illnesses and conditions -- cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, lungdisease, and strokes -- can be prevented. And yet only a fraction of every health care dollargoes to prevention or public health. And that's starting to change with an investment we'remaking in prevention and wellness programs that can help us avoid disease that harm ourhealth and the health of our economy.But as important as they are, investments in electronic records and preventive care, all thethings that I've just mentioned, they're just preliminary steps. They will only make a dent inthe epidemic of rising costs in this country.Despite what some have suggested, the reason we have these spiraling costs is not simplybecause we've got an aging population; demographics do account for part of rising costsbecause older, sicker societies pay more on health care than younger, healthier ones, andthere's nothing intrinsically wrong in us taking better care of ourselves. But what accounts forthe bulk of our costs is the nature of our health care delivery system itself -- a system wherewe spend vast amounts of money on things that aren't necessarily making our people anyhealthier; a system that automatically equates more expensive care with better care.Now, a recent article in the New Yorker, for example, showed how McAllen, Texas, is spendingtwice as much as El Paso County -- twice as much -- not because people in McAllen, Texas,are sicker than they are in El Paso; not because they're getting better care or getting betteroutcomes.It's simply because they're using more treatments -- treatments that, in some cases, theydon't really need; treatments that, in some cases, can actually do people harm by raising therisk of infection or medical error.And the problem is this pattern is repeating itself across America. One Dartmouth study showsthat you're less likely -- you're no less likely to die from a heart attack and other ailments in ahigher-spending area than in a lower-spending one.There are two main reasons for this. The first is a system of incentives where the more testsand services are provided, the more money we pay. And a lot of people in this room knowwhat I'm talking about. It's a model that rewards the quantity of care rather than the qualityof care; that pushes you, the doctor, to see more and more patients even if you can't spendmuch time with each, and gives you every incentive to order that extra MRI or EKG, even ifit's not necessary. It's a model that has taken the pursuit of medicine from a profession -- acalling -- to a business.That's not why you became doctors. That's not why you put in all those hours in the AnatomySuite or the O.R. That's not what brings you back to a patient's bedside to check in, or makesyou call a loved one of a patient to say it will be fine. You didn't enter this profession to bebean-counters and paper-pushers. You entered this profession to be healers. And that's whatour health care system should let you be. That's what this health care system should let yoube. Now, that starts with reforming the way we compensate our providers -- doctors andhospitals. We need to bundle payments so you aren't paid for every single treatment you offera patient with a chronic condition like diabetes, but instead paid well for how you treat theoverall disease. We need to create incentives for physicians to team up, because we know thatwhen that happens, it results in a healthier patient. We need to give doctors bonuses for goodhealth outcomes, so we're not promoting just more treatment, but better care.And we need to rethink the cost of a medical education, and do more to reward medicalstudents who choose a career as a primary care physician -- who choose to work inunderserved areas instead of the more lucrative paths. That's why we're making a substantialinvestment in the National Health Service Corps that will make medical training moreaffordable for primary care doctors and nurse practitioners so they aren't drowning in debtwhen they enter the workforce. Somebody back there is drowning in debt.The second structural reform we need to make is to improve the quality of medicalinformation making its way to doctors and patients. We have the best medical schools, themost sophisticated labs, the most advanced training of any nation on the globe. Yet we're notdoing a very good job harnessing our collective knowledge and experience on behalf of bettermedicine.Less than 1 percent of our health care spending goes to examining what treatments are mosteffective -- less than 1 percent. And even when that information finds its way into journals, itcan take up to 17 years to find its way to an exam room or operating table. As a result, toomany doctors and patients are making decisions without the benefit of the latest research.A recent study, for example, found that only half of all cardiac guidelines are based onscientific evidence -- half.That means doctors may be doing a bypass operation when placing a stent is equallyeffective; or placing a stent when adjusting a patient's drug and medical management isequally effective -- all of which drives up costs without improving a patient's health.So one thing we need to do is to figure out what works, and encourage rapid implementationof what works into your practices. That's why we're making a major investment in research toidentify the best treatments for a variety of ailments and conditions.Now, let me be clear -- I just want to clear something up here -- identifying what works is notabout dictating what kind of care should be provided. It's about providing patients and doctorswith the information they need to make the best medical decisions. See, I have theassumption that if you have good information about what makes your patients well, that'swhat you're going to do. I have confidence in that. We're not going to need to force you to doit. We just need to make sure you've got the best information available.Still, even when we do know what works, we are often not making the most of it. And that'swhy we need to build on the examples of outstanding medicine at places like the CincinnatiChildren's Hospital, where the quality of care for cystic fibrosis patients shot up after thehospital began incorporating suggestions from parents. And places like Tallahassee MemorialHealth Care, where deaths were dramatically reduced with rapid response teams thatmonitored patients' conditions, and ""multidisciplinary rounds"" with everyone from physiciansto pharmacists. And places like Geisinger Health System in rural Pennsylvania, andIntermountain Health in Salt Lake City, where high-quality care is being provided at a costwell below the national average. These are all islands of excellence that we need to make thestandard in our health care system.So replicating best practices, incentivizing excellence, closing cost disparities -- any legislationsent to my desk that does not these -- does not achieve these goals in my mind does not earnthe title of reform.But my signature on a bill is not enough. I need your help, doctors, because to mostAmericans you are the health care system. The fact is Americans -- and I include myself andMichelle and our kids in this -- we just do what you tell us to do. That's what we do. We listento you, we trust you. And that's why I will listen to you and work with you to pursue reformthat works for you. Together, if we take all these steps, I am convinced we can bring spending down, bringquality up; we can save hundreds of billions of dollars on health care costs while making ourhealth care system work better for patients and doctors alike. And when we align the interestsof patients and doctors, then we're going to be in a good place.Now, I recognize that it will be hard to make some of these changes if doctors feel like they'reconstantly looking over their shoulders for fear of lawsuits. I recognize that. Don't get tooexcited yet.Now, I understand some doctors may feel the need to order more tests and treatments toavoid being legally vulnerable. That's a real issue. Now, just hold on to your horses here,guys. I want to be honest with you. I'm not advocating caps on malpractice awards -- which Ipersonally believe can be unfair to people who've been wrongfully harmed.But I do think we need to explore a range of ideas about how to put patient safety first; howto let doctors focus on practicing medicine; how to encourage broader use of evidence-basedguidelines. I want to work with the AMA so we can scale back the excessive defensivemedicine that reinforces our current system, and shift to a system where we are providingbetter care, simply -- rather than simply more treatment.So this is going to be a priority for me. And I know, based on your responses, it's a priority foryou. And I look forward to working with you. And it's going to be difficult. But all this stuff isgoing to be difficult. All of it's going to be important.Now, I know this has been a long speech, but we got more to do. The changes that I havealready spoken about, all that is going to need to go hand-in-hand with other reforms.Because our health care system is so complex and medicine is always evolving, we need away to continually evaluate how we can eliminate waste, reduce costs, and improve quality.That's why I'm open to expanding the role of a commission created by a Republican Congresscalled the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, which happens to include a number ofphysicians on the commission. In recent years, this commission proposed roughly $200 billionin savings that never made it into law. These recommendations have now been incorporatedinto our broader reform agenda, but we need to fast-track their proposals, the commission'sproposals, in the future so that we don't miss another opportunity to save billions of dollars,as we gain more information about what works and what doesn't work in our health caresystem.And as we seek to contain the cost of health care, we also have to ensure that every Americancan get coverage they can afford. We must do so in part because it's in all of our economicinterests. Each time an uninsured American steps foot into an emergency room with no way toreimburse the hospital for care, the cost is handed over to every American family as a bill ofabout $1,000 that's reflected in higher taxes, higher premiums, and higher health care costs.It's a hidden tax, a hidden bill that will be cut as we insure all Americans. And as we insureevery young and healthy American, it will spread out risk for insurance companies, furtherreducing costs for everyone.But alongside these economic arguments, there's another, more powerful one. And it is simplythis: We are not a nation that accepts nearly 46 million uninsured men, women and children.We are not a nation that lets hardworking families go without coverage, or turns its back onthose in need. We're a nation that cares for its citizens. We look out for one another. That'swhat makes us the United States of America. We need to get this done.So we need to do a few things to provide affordable health insurance to every singleAmerican. The first thing we need to do is to protect what's working in our health caresystem. So just in case you didn't catch it the first time, let me repeat: If you like your healthcare system and your doctor, the only thing reform will mean to you is your health care willcost less. If anyone says otherwise, they are either trying to mislead you or don't have theirfacts straight.Now, if you don't like your health care coverage or you don't have any insurance at all, you'llhave a chance, under what we've proposed, to take part in what we're calling a HealthInsurance Exchange. This exchange will allow you to one-stop shop for a health care plan,compare benefits and prices, and choose a plan that's best for you and your family -- thesame way, by the way, that federal employees can do, from a postal worker to a member ofCongress. You will have your choice of a number of plans that offer a few different packages,but every plan would offer an affordable, basic package.Again, this is for people who aren't happy with their current plan. If you like what you'regetting, keep it. Nobody is forcing you to shift. But if you're not, this gives you some newoptions. And I believe one of these options needs to be a public option that will give people abroader range of choices -- and inject competition into the health care market so that force --so that we can force waste out of the system and keep the insurance companies honest.Now, I know that there's some concern about a public option. Even within this organizationthere's healthy debate about it. In particular, I understand that you're concerned that today'sMedicare rates, which many of you already feel are too low, will be applied broadly in a waythat means our cost savings are coming off your backs.And these are legitimate concerns, but they're ones, I believe, that can be overcome. As Istated earlier, the reforms we propose to reimbursement are to reward best practices, focuson patient care, not on the current piecework reimbursements. What we seek is more stabilityand a health care system that's on a sounder financial footing.And the fact is these reforms need to take place regardless of whether there's a public optionor not. With reform, we will ensure that you are being reimbursed in a thoughtful way that'stied to patient outcomes, instead of relying on yearly negotiations about the SustainableGrowth Rate formula that's based on politics and the immediate state of the federal budget inany given year.And I just want to point out the alternative to such reform is a world where health care costsgrow at an unsustainable rate. And if you don't think that's going to threaten yourreimbursements and the stability of our health care system, you haven't been payingattention.So the public option is not your enemy; it is your friend, I believe.Let me also say that -- let me also address a illegitimate concern that's being put forward bythose who are claiming that a public option is somehow a Trojan horse for a single-payersystem. I'll be honest; there are countries where a single-payer system works pretty well. ButI believe -- and I've taken some flak from members of my own party for this belief -- that it'simportant for our reform efforts to build on our traditions here in the United States. So whenyou hear the naysayers claim that I'm trying to bring about government-run health care,know this: They're not telling the truth.What I am trying to do -- and what a public option will help do -- is put affordable health carewithin reach for millions of Americans. And to help ensure that everyone can afford the cost ofa health care option in our exchange, we need to provide assistance to families who need it.That way, there will be no reason at all for anyone to remain uninsured.Indeed, it's because I'm confident in our ability to give people the ability to get insurance atan affordable rate that I'm open to a system where every American bears responsibility forowning health insurance -- so long as we provide a hardship waiver for those who still can'tafford it as we move towards this system.The same is true for employers. While I believe every business has a responsibility to providehealth insurance for its workers, small businesses that can't afford it should receive anexemption. And small business workers and their families will be able to seek coverage in theexchange if their employer is not able to provide it.Now, here's some good news. Insurance companies have expressed support for the idea ofcovering the uninsured and they certainly are in favor of a mandate. I welcome theirwillingness to engage constructively in the reform debate. I'm glad they're at the table. Butwhat I refuse to do is simply create a system where insurance companies suddenly have awhole bunch of more customers on Uncle Sam's dime, but still fail to meet theirresponsibilities. We're not going to do that.Let me give you an example of what I'm talking about. We need to end the practice ofdenying coverage on the basis of preexisting conditions. The days of cherry-picking who tocover and who to deny, those days are over. I know you see it in your practices, and howincredibly painful and frustrating it is -- you want to give somebody care and you find out thatthe insurance companies are wiggling out of paying.This is personal for me also. I've told this story before. I'll never forget watching my ownmother, as she fought cancer in her final days, spending time worrying about whether herinsurer would claim her illness was a preexisting condition so it could get out of providingcoverage. Changing the current approach to preexisting conditions is the least we can do --for my mother and for every other mother, father, son, and daughter, who has suffered underthis practice, who've been paying premiums and don't get care. We need to put health carewithin the reach for millions of Americans.Now, even if we accept all of the economic and moral reasons for providing affordablecoverage to all Americans, there is no denying that expanding coverage will come at a cost, atleast in the short run. But it is a cost that will not -- I repeat -- will not add to our deficits. I'veset down a rule for my staff, for my team -- and I've said this to Congress -- health carereform must be, and will be, deficit-neutral in the next decade.Now, there are already voices saying the numbers don't add up. They're wrong. Here's why.Making health care affordable for all Americans will cost somewhere on the order of $1 trillionover the next 10 years. That's real money, even in Washington. But remember, that's lessthan we are projected to have spent on the war in Iraq. And also remember, failing to reformour health care system in a way that genuinely reduces cost growth will cost us trillions ofdollars more in lost economic growth and lower wages.That said, let me explain how we will cover the price tag. First, as part of the budget that waspassed a few months ago, we put aside $635 billion over 10 years in what we're calling aHealth Reserve Fund. Over half of that amount -- more than $300 billion -- will come fromraising revenue by doing things like modestly limiting the tax deductions the wealthiestAmericans can take to the same level that it was at the end of the Reagan years -- same levelthat it was under Ronald Reagan. Some are concerned that this will dramatically reducecharitable giving, for example, but statistics show that's not true. And the best thing for ourcharities is the stronger economy that we will build with health care reform.But we can't just raise revenues. We're also going to have to make spending cuts, in part byexamining inefficiencies in our current Medicare program. There are going to be robustdebates about where these cuts should be made, and I welcome that debate. But here'swhere I think these cuts should be made.First, we should end overpayments to Medicare Advantage. Today, we're paying MedicareAdvantage plans much more than we pay for traditional Medicare services. Now, this is a gooddeal for insurance companies. It's a subsidy to insurance companies. It's not a good deal foryou. It's not a good deal for the American people. And by the way, it doesn't follow freemarket principles, for those who are always talking about free market principles. That's whywe need to introduce competitive bidding into the Medicare Advantage program, a programunder which private insurance companies are offering Medicare coverage. That alone will save$177 billion over the next decade, just that one step.Second, we need to use Medicare reimbursements to reduce preventable hospitalreadmissions. Right now, almost 20 percent of Medicare patients discharged from hospitalsare readmitted within a month, often because they're not getting the comprehensive care thatthey need. This puts people at risk; it drives up cost. By changing how Medicare reimburseshospitals, we can discourage them from acting in a way that boosts profits but drives up costsfor everyone else. That will save us $25 billion over the next decade.Third, we need to introduce generic biologic drugs into the marketplace.These are drugs usedto treat illnesses like anemia. But right now, there is no pathway at the FDA for approvinggeneric versions of these drugs. Creating such a pathway will save us billions of dollars. Wecan save another roughly $30 billion by getting a better deal for our poorer seniors whileasking our well-off seniors to pay a little more for their drugs.So that's the bulk of what's in the Health Reserve Fund. I've also proposed saving another$313 billion in Medicare and Medicaid spending in several other ways. One way is by adjustingMedicare payments to reflect new advances and productivity gains in our economy. Right now,Medicare payments are rising each year by more than they should. These adjustments willcreate incentives for providers to deliver care more efficiently, and save us roughly $109billion in the process.Another way we can achieve savings is by reducing payments to hospitals for treatinguninsured people. I know hospitals rely on these payments now, legitimately, because of thelarge number of uninsured patients that they treat. But if we put in a system where peoplehave coverage and the number of uninsured people goes down with our reforms, the amountwe pay hospitals to treat uninsured people should go down, as well. Reducing these paymentsgradually, as more and more people have coverage, will save us over $106 billion. And we'llmake sure the difference goes to the hospitals that need it most.We can also save about $75 billion through more efficient purchasing of prescription drugs.And we can save about $1 billion more by rooting out waste, abuse, fraud throughout ourhealth care system so that no one is charging more for a service than it's worth or charging adime for a service that they don't provide.Let me be clear: I'm committed to making these cuts in a way that protects our seniorcitizens. In fact, these proposals will actually extend the life of the Medicare Trust Fund byseven years, and reduce premiums for Medicare beneficiaries by roughly $43 billion over thenext 10 years. And I'm working with AARP to uphold that commitment.Now, for those of you who took out your pencil and paper -- altogether, these savings meanthat we've put about $950 billion on the table -- and that doesn't count some of the long-termsavings that we think will come about from reform -- from medical IT, for example, orincreased investment in prevention. So that stuff in congressional jargon is not scorable; theCongressional Budget Office won't count that as savings, so we're setting that aside. We thinkthat's going to come, but even separate and far from that, we've put $950 billion on the table,taking us almost all the way to covering the full cost of health care reform.In the weeks and months ahead, I look forward to working with Congress to make up thedifference so that health care reform is fully paid for -- in a real, accountable way. And let meadd that this does not count longer-term savings. I just want to repeat that.By insisting that the reforms that we're introducing are deficit-neutral over the next decade,and by making the reforms that will help slow the growth rate of health care costs over thecoming decades -- bending the curve -- we can look forward to faster economic growth,higher living standards, and falling, instead of rising, budget deficits.Now, let me just wrap up by saying this. I know people are cynical whether we can do this ornot. I know there will be disagreements about how to proceed in the days ahead. There'sprobably healthy debate within the AMA. That's good. I also know this: We can't let thismoment pass us by.You know, the other day, a friend of mine, Congressman Earl Blumenauer, handed me amagazine with a special issue titled, ""The Crisis in American Medicine."" One article notes""soaring charges."" Another warns about the ""volume of utilization of services."" Another asks ifwe can find a ""better way than fee-for-service for paying for medical care."" It speaks to manyof the challenges we face today. The thing is, this special issue was published by Harper'sMagazine in October of 1960 -- before I was born.Members of the American Medical Association, and my fellow Americans, I'm here todaybecause I don't want our children and their children to still be speaking of a crisis in Americanmedicine 50 years from now. I don't want them to still be suffering from spiraling costs thatwe did not stem, or sicknesses that we did not cure. I don't want them to be burdened withmassive deficits we did not curb or a worsening economy that we did not rebuild.I want them to benefit from a health care system that works for all of us; where families canopen a doctor's bill without dreading what's inside; where parents are talking to their kids andgetting them to get regular checkups, and testing themselves for preventable ailments; whereparents are feeding their kids healthier food and kids are exercising more; where patients arespending more time with their doctors, and doctors can pull up on a computer all the medicalinformation and latest research they'll ever want to know to meet patients' needs; whereorthopedists and nephrologists and oncologists are all working together to treat a singlehuman being; where what's best about America's health care system has become thehallmark of America's health care system.That's the health care system we can build. That's the future I'm convinced is within ourreach.And if we're willing to come together and bring about that future, then we will not only makeAmericans healthier, we will not only unleash America's economic potential, but we willreaffirm the ideals that led you into this noble profession and we'll build a health care systemthat lets all Americans heal.Thank you very much, AMA. Appreciate it, thank you.",obama
"Good afternoon, everybody. Today I want to start by addressing three issues, and then I'lltake your questions.       First, I'd like to say a few words about the situation in Iran. The United States and theinternational community have been appalled and outraged by the threats, the beatings, andimprisonments of the last few days. I strongly condemn these unjust actions, and I join withthe American people in mourning each and every innocent life that is lost.I've made it clear that the United States respects the sovereignty of the Islamic Republic ofIran, and is not interfering with Iran's affairs. But we must also bear witness to the courageand the dignity of the Iranian people, and to a remarkable opening within Iranian society. Andwe deplore the violence against innocent civilians anywhere that it takes place.The Iranian people are trying to have a debate about their future. Some in Iran -- Some in theIranian government, in particular, are trying to avoid that debate by accusing the UnitedStates and others in the West of instigating protests over the election. These accusations arepatently false. They're an obvious attempt to distract people from what is truly taking placewithin Iran's borders. This tired strategy of using old tensions to scapegoat other countrieswon't work anymore in Iran. This is not about the United States or the West; this is about thepeople of Iran, and the future that they -- and only they -- will choose. The Iranian people canspeak for themselves. That's precisely what's happened in the last few days.In 2009, no iron fist is strong enough to shut off the world from bearing witness to peacefulprotests of justice. Despite the Iranian government's efforts to expel journalists and isolateitself, powerful images and poignant words have made their way to us through cell phonesand computers, and so we've watched what the Iranian people are doing.This is what we've witnessed.We've seen the timeless dignity of tens of thousands of Iranians marching in silence. We'veseen people of all ages risk everything to insist that their votes are counted and that theirvoices are heard. Above all, we've seen courageous women stand up to the brutality andthreats, and we've experienced the searing image of a woman bleeding to death on thestreets. While this loss is raw and extraordinarily painful, we also know this: Those who standup for justice are always on the right side of history.As I said in Cairo, suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away. The Iranianpeople have a universal right to assembly and free speech. If the Iranian government seeksthe respect of the international community, it must respect those rights and heed the will ofits own people. It must govern through consent and not coercion. That's what Iran's ownpeople are calling for, and the Iranian people will ultimately judge the actions of their owngovernment.",obama

That's what Iran's ownpeople are calling for, and the Iranian people will ultimately judge the actions of their owngovernment.Now, the second issue I want to address is our ongoing effort to build a clean energyeconomy.This week, the House of Representatives is moving ahead on historic legislation that willtransform the way we produce and use energy in America. This legislation will spark a cleanenergy transformation that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and confront the carbonpollution that threatens our planet.This energy bill will create a set of incentives that will spur the development of new sources ofenergy, including wind, solar, and geothermal power. It will also spur new energy savings, likeefficient windows and other materials that reduce heating costs in the winter and cooling costsin the summer.These incentives will finally make clean energy the profitable kind of energy. And that will leadto the development of new technologies that lead to new industries that could create millionsof new jobs in America -- jobs that can't be shipped overseas.At a time of great fiscal challenges, this legislation is paid for by the polluters who currentlyemit the dangerous carbon emissions that contaminate the water we drink and pollute the airthat we breathe. It also provides assistance to businesses and communities as they make thegradual transition to clean energy technologies.So I believe that this legislation is extraordinarily important for our country; it's taken greateffort on the part of many over the course of the past several months. And I want to thankthe Chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Henry Waxman; his colleagues on thatcommittee, including Congressmen Dingell, Ed Markey, and Rick Boucher. I also want to thankCharlie Rangel, the Chair of the Ways and Means Committee, and Collin Peterson, the Chair ofthe Agriculture Committee, for their many and ongoing contributions to this process. And Iwant to express my appreciation to Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer for their leadership.We all know why this is so important. The nation that leads in the creation of a clean energyeconomy will be the nation that leads the 21st century's global economy. That's what thislegislation seeks to achieve -- it's a bill that will open the door to a better future for thisnation. And that's why I urge members of Congress to come together and pass it.The last issue I'd like to address is health care.Right now, Congress is debating various health care reform proposals. This is obviously acomplicated issue, but I am very optimistic about the progress that they're making.Like energy, this is legislation that must and will be paid for. It will not add to our deficits overthe next decade. We will find the money through savings and efficiencies within the healthcare system -- some of which we've already announced.We will also ensure that the reform we pass brings down the crushing cost of health care. Wesimply can't have a system where we throw good money after bad habits. We need to controlthe skyrocketing costs that are driving families, businesses, and our government into greaterand greater debt.There's no doubt that we must preserve what's best about our health care system, and thatmeans allowing Americans who like their doctors and their health care plans to keep them.But unless we fix what's broken in our current system, everyone's health care will be injeopardy. Unless we act, premiums will climb higher, benefits will erode further, and the rollsof the uninsured will swell to include millions more Americans. Unless we act, one out of everyfive dollars that we earn will be spent on health care within a decade. And the amount ourgovernment spends on Medicare and Medicaid will eventually grow larger than what ourgovernment spends on everything else today.When it comes to health care, the status Q: uo is unsustainable and unacceptable. So reformis not a luxury, it's a necessity. And I hope that Congress will continue to make significantprogress on this issue in the weeks ahead.So let me open it up for questions, and I'll start with you, Jennifer.Q: Thank you, Mr. President. Your administration has said that the offer to talk to Iran'sleaders remains open. Can you say if that's still so, even with all the violence that has beencommitted by the government against the peaceful protesters? And if it is, is there any redline that your administration won't cross where that offer will be shut off?President Obama: Well, obviously what's happened in Iran is profound. And we're stillwaiting to see how it plays itself out. My position coming into this office has been that theUnited States has core national security interests in making sure that Iran doesn't possess anuclear weapon and it stops exporting terrorism outside of its borders.We have provided a path whereby Iran can reach out to the international community, engage,and become a part of international norms. It is up to them to make a decision as to whetherthey choose that path. What we've been seeing over the last several days, the last couple ofweeks, obviously is not encouraging, in terms of the path that this regime may choose totake. And the fact that they are now in the midst of an extraordinary debate taking place inIran may end up coloring how they respond to the international community as a whole.We are going to monitor and see how this plays itself out before we make any judgmentsabout how we proceed. But just to reiterate, there is a path available to Iran in which theirsovereignty is respected, their traditions, their culture, their faith is respected, but one inwhich they are part of a larger community that has responsibilities and operates according tonorms and international rules that are universal. We don't know how they're going to respondyet, and that's what we're waiting to see.Q: So should there be consequences for what's happened so far?President Obama: I think that the international community is, as I said before, bearingwitness to what's taking place. And the Iranian government should understand that how theyhandle the dissent within their own country, generated indigenously, internally, from theIranian people, will help shape the tone not only for Iran's future but also its relationship toother countries.Since we're on Iran, I know Nico Pitney is here from Huffington Post.Q: Thank you, Mr. President.President Obama: Nico, I know that you, and all across the Internet, we've been seeing a lotof reports coming directly out of Iran. I know that there may actually be Questions frompeople in Iran who are communicating through the Internet. Do you have a question?Q: Yes, I did, I wanted to use this opportunity to ask you a question directly from an Iranian.We solicited questions last night from people who are still courageous enough to becommunicating online, and one of them wanted to ask you this: Under which conditions wouldyou accept the election of Ahmadinejad? And if you do accept it without any significantchanges in the conditions there, isn't that a betrayal of what the demonstrators there areworking towards?President Obama: Well, look, we didn't have international observers on the ground. Wecan't say definitively what exactly happened at polling places throughout the country. Whatwe know is that a sizeable percentage of the Iranian people themselves, spanning Iraniansociety, consider this election illegitimate. It's not an isolated instance -- a little grumblinghere or there. There is significant questions about the legitimacy of the election.And so ultimately the most important thing for the Iranian government to consider islegitimacy in the eyes of its own people, not in the eyes of the United States. And that's whyI've been very clear: Ultimately, this is up to the Iranian people to decide who their leadershipis going to be and the structure of their government.What we can do is to say unequivocally that there are sets of international norms andprinciples about violence, about dealing with peaceful dissent, that spans cultures, spansborders. And what we've been seeing over the Internet and what we've been seeing in newsreports violates those norms and violates those principles.I think it is not too late for the Iranian government to recognize that there is a peaceful paththat will lead to stability and legitimacy and prosperity for the Iranian people. We hope theytake it.Jeff Mason of Reuters.Q: Right here, sir. Switching gears slightly, in light of the financial regulation and reform thatyou have made, how do you rate the performance of the Fed in handling the financial crisis?And more specifically, how do you rate the performance of Ben Bernanke, and would you likehim to stay on when his term ends in January?President Obama: I'm not going to make news about Ben Bernanke -- although I think hehas done a fine job under very difficult circumstances.I would say that all financial regulators didn't do everything that needed to be done to preventthe crisis from happening. And that's why we've put forward the boldest set of reforms infinancial regulation in 75 years, because there were too many gaps where there were laws onthe books that would have brought about a prevention of the crisis; the enforcement wasn'tthere. In some cases, there just weren't sufficient laws on the books -- for example, with thenon-banking sector.I think that the Fed probably performed better than most other regulators prior to the crisistaking place, but I think they'd be the first to acknowledge that in dealing with systemic riskand anticipating systemic risk, they didn't do everything that needed to be done.I think since the crisis has occurred, Ben Bernanke has performed very well. And one of thecentral concepts behind our financial regulatory reform is that there's got to be somebody whois responsible not just for monitoring the health of individual institutions, but somebody who'smonitoring the systemic risks of the system as a whole. And we believe that the Fed has themost technical expertise and the best track record in terms of doing that.But that's not the only part of financial regulation. One of the things that we're putting a hugeamount of emphasis on is the issue of consumer protection -- whether it's subprime loans thatwere given out because nobody was paying attention to what was being peddled toconsumers, whether it's how credit cards are handled, how annuities are dealt with, whatpeople can expect in terms of understanding their 401(k)s. There's a whole bunch of financialtransactions out there where consumers are not protected the way they should, and that'swhy we said we're going to put forward a consumer financial protection agency whose onlyjob it is to focus on those issues.Now, the Fed was one of the regulators that had some of those consumer responsibilities. Weactually think that they're better off focusing on issues of broad systemic risk, and we havejust one agency that's focused on the consumer protection side.Q: But is the Fed getting too powerful?President Obama: If you look at what we've proposed, we are not so much expanding theFed's power as we are focusing what the Fed needs to do to prevent the kinds of crises thatare happening again. Another good example is the issue of resolution authority. I think itwasn't that long ago where everybody was properly outraged about AIG, and the enormousamounts of money the taxpayers had to put into AIG in order to prevent it from dragging theentire financial system down with it.Had we had the kinds of resolution authority, the kinds of laws that were in place that wouldallow a orderly winding down of AIG, then potentially taxpayers could have saved a hugeamount of money. We want that power to be available so that taxpayers aren't on the hook.All right? Major Garrett. Where's Major?Q: Right here, sir. In your opening remarks, sir, you were -- you said about Iran that youwere appalled and outraged. What took you so long to say those words?President Obama: I don't think that's accurate. Track what I've been saying. Right after theelection, I said that we had profound concerns about the nature of the election, but that it wasnot up to us to determine what the outcome was. As soon as violence broke out -- in fact, inanticipation of potential violence -- we were very clear in saying that violence wasunacceptable, that that was not how governments operate with respect to their people.So we've been entirely consistent, Major, in terms of how we've approached this. My role hasbeen to say the United States is not going to be a foil for the Iranian government to try toblame what's happening on the streets of Tehran on the CIA or on the White House; that thisis an issue that is led by and given voice to the frustrations of the Iranian people. And sowe've been very consistent the first day, and we're going to continue to be consistent insaying this is not an issue about the United States; this is about an issue of the Iranianpeople.What we've also been consistent about is saying that there are some universal principles,including freedom of assembly and freedom of speech, making sure that governments are notusing coercion and violence and repression in terms of how they interact with peacefuldemonstrators. And we have been speaking out very clearly about that fact.Q: Are Iranian diplomats still welcome at the embassy on the Fourth of July, sir?President Obama: Well, I think as you're aware, Major, we don't have formal diplomaticrelations with -- we don't have formal diplomatic relations with Iran. I think that we have saidthat if Iran chooses a path that abides by international norms and principles, then we areinterested in healing some of the wounds of 30 years, in terms of U.S.-Iranian relations. Butthat is a choice that the Iranians are going to have to make.Q: But the offer still stands?President Obama: That's a choice the Iranians are going to have to make.David Jackson.Q: Thank you, Mr. President. Two of the key players in the insurance industry, America'sHealth Insurance Plans and Blue Cross-Blue Shield, sent a letter to the Senate this morningsaying that a government health insurance plan would ""dismantle"" private insurers. Why arethey wrong? And secondly, this public plan, is this non-negotiable? Would you sign a healthcare bill without it?President Obama: Well, let's talk first of all about health care reform more broadly.I think in this debate there's been some notion that if we just stand pat we're okay. And that'sjust not true. You know, there are polls out that show that 70 or 80 percent of Americans aresatisfied with the health insurance that they currently have. The only problem is thatpremiums have been doubling every nine years, going up three times faster than wages. TheU.S. government is not going to be able to afford Medicare and Medicaid on its currenttrajectory. Businesses are having to make very tough decisions about whether we dropcoverage or we further restrict coverage.So the notion that somehow we can just keep on doing what we're doing and that's okay,that's just not true. We have a longstanding critical problem in our health care system that ispulling down our economy, it's burdening families, it's burdening businesses, and it is theprimary driver of our federal deficits. All right?So if we start from the premise that the status Q: uo is unacceptable, then that means we'regoing to have to bring about some serious changes. What I've said is, our top priority has tobe to control costs. And that means not just tinkering around the edges. It doesn't mean justlopping off reimbursements for doctors in any given year because we're trying to fix ourbudget. It means that we look at the kinds of incentives that exist, what our delivery systemis like, why it is that some communities are spending 30 percent less than other communitiesbut getting better health care outcomes, and figuring out how can we make sure thateverybody is benefiting from lower costs and better quality by improving practices. It meanshealth IT. It means prevention.So all these things are the starting point, I think, for reform. And I've said very clearly: If anybill arrives from Congress that is not controlling costs, that's not a bill I can support. It's goingto have to control costs. It's going to have to be paid for. So there's been a lot of talk about,well, a trillion-dollar price tag. What I've said is, if we're going to spend that much money,then it's going to be largely funded through reallocating dollars that are already in the healthcare system but aren't being spent well. If we're spending $177 billion over 10 years tosubsidize insurance companies under Medicare Advantage, when there's no showing thatpeople are healthier using that program than the regular Medicare program, well, that's not agood deal for taxpayers. And we're going to take that money and we're going to use it toprovide better care at a cheaper cost to the American people. So that's point number one.Number two, while we are in the process of dealing with the cost issue, I think it's also wisepolicy and the right thing to do to start providing coverage for people who don't have healthinsurance or are underinsured, are paying a lot of money for high deductibles. I get letters --two, three letters a day -- that I read of families who don't have health insurance, are goingbankrupt, are on the brink of losing their insurance; have deductibles that are so high thateven with insurance they end up with $50,000, $100,000 worth of debt; are at risk of losingtheir homes.And that has to be part of reform, making sure that even if you've got health insurance now,you are not worried that when you lose your job or your employer decides to change policiesthat somehow you're going to be out of luck. I think about the woman who was in Wisconsinthat I was with, who introduced me up in Green Bay -- 36 years old, double mastectomy;breast cancer has now moved to her bones and she's got two little kids, a husband with a job.They had health insurance, but they're still $50,000 in debt, and she's thinking, my mainlegacy, if I don't survive this thing, is going to be leaving $100,000 worth of debt. So thoseare the things that I'm prioritizing.Now, the public plan I think is a important tool to discipline insurance companies. What we'vesaid is, under our proposal, let's have a system the same way that federal employees do,same way that members of Congress do, where -- we call it an ""exchange,"" or you can call ita ""marketplace"" -- where essentially you've got a whole bunch of different plans.If you like your plan and you like your doctor, you won't have to do a thing. You keep yourplan. You keep your doctor. If your employer is providing you good health insurance, terrific,we're not going to mess with it.But if you're a small business person, if the insurance that's being offered is something youcan't afford, if you want to shop for a better price, then you can go to this exchange, thismarketplace, and you can look: Okay, this is how much this plan costs, this is how much thatplan costs, this is what the coverage is like, this is what fits for my family. As one of thoseoptions, for us to be able to say, here's a public option that's not profit-driven, that can keepdown administrative costs and that provides you good, quality care for a reasonable price --as one of the options for you to choose, I think that makes sense.Q: Won't that drive private insurers out of business?President Obama: Why would it drive private insurers out of business? If private insurerssay that the marketplace provides the best quality health care, if they tell us that they'reoffering a good deal, then why is it that the government -- which they say can't run anything -- suddenly is going to drive them out of business? That's not logical.Now, I think that there's going to be some healthy debates in Congress about the shape thatthis takes. I think there can be some legitimate concerns on the part of private insurers that ifany public plan is simply being subsidized by taxpayers endlessly, that over time they can'tcompete with the government just printing money.So there are going to be some I think legitimate debates to be had about how this privateplan takes shape. But just conceptually, the notion that all these insurance companies whosay they're giving consumers the best possible deal, that they can't compete against a publicplan as one option, with consumers making the decision what's the best deal. That defieslogic, which is why I think you've seen in the polling data overwhelming support for a publicplan. All right?Q: Is that non-negotiable?President Obama: Chip.Q: Thank you, Mr. President. Following up on Major's question, some republicans on CapitolHill -- John McCain and Lindsey Graham, for example -- have said that up to this point, yourresponse on Iran has been timid and weak. Today, it sounded a lot stronger. It sounded likethe kind of speech John McCain has been urging you to give, saying that those who stand upfor justice are always on the right side of history, referring to an iron fist in Iran -- ""deplore,""""appalled,"" ""outraged."" Were you influenced at all by John McCain and Lindsey Grahamaccusing you of being timid and weak?President Obama: What do you think? Look, the -- I think John McCain has genuine passionabout many of these international issues, and I think that all of us share a belief that we wantjustice to prevail. But only I'm the President of the United States, and I've got responsibilitiesin making certain that we are continually advancing our national security interests and that weare not used as a tool to be exploited by other countries.I mean, you guys must have seen the reports. They've got some of the comments that I'vemade being mistranslated in Iran, suggesting that I'm telling rioters to go out and riot somemore. There are reports suggesting that the CIA is behind all this -- all of which are patentlyfalse. But it gives you a sense of the narrative that the Iranian government would love to playinto. So the -- members of Congress, they've got their constitutional duties, and I'm sure theywill carry them out in the way that they think is appropriate. I'm President of the UnitedStates, and I'll carry out my duties as I think are appropriate. All right?Q: By speaking so strongly today, aren't you giving the leadership in Iran the fodder to makethose arguments that it is about the United States?President Obama: Look, I mean, I think that -- we can parse this as much as we want. Ithink if you look at the statements that I've made, they've been very consistent. I just made astatement on Saturday in which we said we deplore the violence. And so I think that in thehothouse of Washington, there may be all kinds of stuff going back and forth in terms ofRepublican critics versus the administration. That's not what is relevant to the Iranian people.What's relevant to them right now is, are they going to have their voices heard?And, frankly, a lot of them aren't paying a lot of attention to what's being said on Capitol Hill,and probably aren't spending a lot of time thinking about what's being said here. They'retrying to figure out how can they make sure justice is served in Iran.Q: So there's no news in your statement today?President Obama: Chuck Todd.Q: Mr. President, I want to follow up on Iran. You have avoided twice spelling outconsequences. You've hinted that there would be, from the international community, if theycontinue to violate -- you said violate these norms. You seem to hint that there are humanrights violations taking place./President Obama: I'm not hinting. I think that when a young woman gets shot on the streetwhen she gets out of her car, that's a problem.Q: Then why won't you spell out the consequences that the Iranian --President Obama: Because I think, Chuck, that we don't know yet how this thing is going toplay out. I know everybody here is on a 24-hour news cycle. I'm not.Q: But shouldn't -- I mean, shouldn't the world and Iran --President Obama: Chuck, I answered --Q: -- but shouldn't the Iranian regime know that there are consequences?President Obama: I answered the question, Chuck, which is that we don't yet know how thisis going to play out.Jake Tapper.Q: Thank you, Mr. President. Before I ask my question, I'm wondering if you could actuallyanswer David's. Is the public plan non-negotiable?President Obama: That's your question.Q: Well, you didn't answer --President Obama: You think you're going to -- are you the ombudsman for the White Housepress corps? What's your -- is that your question?Q: Then I have a two-part question. Is the public plan non-negotiable? And while I appreciateyour Spock-like language about the logic of the health care plan, the public plan, it does seemlogical to a lot of people that if the government is offering a cheaper health care plan, thenlots of employers will want to have their employees covered by that cheaper plan, which willnot have to be for profit, unlike private plans, and may possibly benefit from somegovernment subsidies, who knows. And then their employees would be signed up for thispublic plan, which would violate what you're promising the American people, that they will nothave to change health care plans if they like the plan they have.President Obama: I got you. You're pitching, I'm catching. I got the question. First of all,was the reference to Spock -- is that a crack on my ears? All right, I just want to make sure.No?Q: I would never make fun of your ears, sir.President Obama: In answer to David's question, which you co-opted, we are still early inthis process, so we have not drawn lines in the sand other than that reform has to controlcosts and that it has to provide relief to people who don't have health insurance or areunderinsured. Those are the broad parameters that we've discussed.There are a whole host of other issues where ultimately I may have a strong opinion, and Iwill express those to members of Congress as this is shaping up. It's too early to say that.Right now I will say that our position is that a public plan makes sense.Now, let me go to the broader question you made about the public plan. As I said before, Ithink that there is a legitimate concern if the public plan was simply eating off the taxpayertrough, that it would be hard for private insurers to complete. If, on the other hand, the publicplan is structured in such a way where they've got to collect premiums and they've got toprovide good services, then if what the insurance companies are saying is true, that they'redoing their best to serve their customers, that they're in the business of keeping people welland giving them security when they get sick, they should be able to compete.Now, if it turns out that the public plan, for example, is able to reduce administrative costssignificantly, then you know what? I'd like insurance companies to take note and say, hey, ifthe public plan can do that, why can't we? And that's good for everybody in the system. And Idon't think there should be any objection to that.Now, by the way, I should point out that part of the reform that we've suggested is that if youwant to be a private insurer as part of the exchange, as part of this marketplace, this menu ofoptions that people can choose from, we're going to have some different rules for allinsurance companies -- one of them being that you can't preclude people from getting healthinsurance because of a pre-existing condition, you can't cherry pick and just take thehealthiest people.So there are going to be some ground rules that are going to apply to all insurancecompanies, because I think the American people understand that, too often, insurancecompanies have been spending more time thinking about how to take premiums and thenavoid providing people coverage than they have been thinking about how can we make surethat insurance is there, health care is there when families need it.But I'm confident that if -- I take those advocates of the free market to heart when they saythat the free market is innovative and is going to compete on service and is going to competeon their ability to deliver good care to families. And if that's the case then this just becomesone more option. If it's not the case then I think that that's something that the Americanpeople should know.Q: I'm sorry, but what about keeping your promise to the American people that they won'thave to change plans even if employers --President Obama: Well, no, no, I mean -- when I say if you have your plan and you like itand your doctor has a plan, or you have a doctor and you like your doctor that you don't haveto change plans, what I'm saying is the government is not going to make you change plansunder health reform.Now, are there going to be employers right now -- assuming we don't do anything -- let's saythat we take the advice of some folks who are out there and say, oh, this is not the time to dohealth care, we can't afford it, it's too complicated, let's take our time, et cetera. So let'sassume that nothing happened. I can guarantee you that there's a possibility for a whole lot ofAmericans out there that they're not going to end up having the same health care they have,because what's going to happen is, as costs keep on going up, employers are going to startmaking decisions: We've got to raise premiums on our employees; in some cases, we can'tprovide health insurance at all.And so there are going to be a whole set of changes out there. That's exactly why healthreform is so important.Margaret, from McClatchy. Where's Margaret? There you are.Q: Thank you, Mr. President. As a former smoker, I understand the frustration and the fearthat comes with quitting. But with the new law that you signed yesterday regulating thetobacco industry, I'd like to ask you a few questions. How many cigarettes a day --President Obama: A few questions?Q: How many cigarettes a day do you now smoke? Do you smoke alone or in the presence ofother people? And do you believe the new law would help you to Q: uit? If so, why?President Obama: Well, first of all, the new law that was put in place is not about me, it'sabout the next generation of kids coming up. So I think it's fair, Margaret, to just say that youjust think it's neat to ask me about my smoking, as opposed to it being relevant to my newlaw. But that's fine, I understand. It's an interesting human -- it's an interesting humaninterest story.But I've said before that, as a former smoker, I constantly struggle with it. Have I fallen offthe wagon sometimes? Yes. Am I a daily smoker, a constant smoker? No. I don't do it in frontof my kids, I don't do it in front of my family, and I would say that I am 95 percent cured, butthere are times where -- there are times where I mess up. And, I mean, I've said this before.I get this question about once every month or so, and I don't know what to tell you, otherthan the fact that, like folks who go to AA, once you've gone down this path, then it'ssomething you continually struggle with, which is precisely why the legislation we signed wasso important, because what we don't want is kids going down that path in the first place.Okay?Macarena Vidal?Q: Mr. President, you're meeting today with Chilean President Michelle Bachelet. You'remeeting next week with Alvaro Uribe from Colombia. Two months ago in Trinidad at theSummit of the Americas, you said that -- you called on Latin American countries to help youwith deeds, not words, particularly towards less democratic countries. Have you noticed anyparticular progress in these two months, and can you give us examples?President Obama: Well, first of all, I'm very much looking forward to seeing PresidentBachelet. I think she's one of the finest leaders in Latin America, a very capable person. If youlook at how Chile has handled the recession, they've handled it very well in part because thesurpluses that they got when copper prices were high they set aside. And so they had theresources to deal with the downturn. It's a good lesson for the United States. When we hadsurpluses, they got dissipated.We think that there's enormous possibilities of making progress in Latin America generally.One of the things that I'll be talking about with President Bachelet is the coordination andcooperation between the United State and Chile on clean energy. We'll have an announcementwhen we do our press conference after my bilateral meeting on some important clean energypartnerships. We're making important progress when it comes to exchanges on cancerresearch. We continue to have a robust trade regime with Chile. And, by the way, Chile hasactually entered into some very interesting partnerships not just with the federal government,but also with state governments like California.So I think the relationship that we have with Chile -- which, by the way, does not fall in linewith U.S. foreign policy on every single issue -- but it's a respectful policy. Chile is animportant partner. I think that's the model that we want: partnership. The United Statesdoesn't dictate how Chile should view its own interests, but in fact we've achieved greatcooperation. And I will be looking at President Bachelet giving us further advice in terms ofhow we can take the kind of relationship we have with Chile and expand that to ourrelationships throughout Latin America.Q: But my question is not only about that -- Chile, but about Latin American countries givingyou a hand on -- against less democratic countries.President Obama: Well, the point is, is that I think Chile is leading by example. So I'm usingChile as an example. But the same is true in Brazil, for example. I mean, President Lula camein, and he's got a very different political orientation than most Americans do. He came upthrough the trade union movement. He was perceived as a strong leftist. It turns out that hewas a very practical person, who although maintains relationships across the politicalspectrum in Latin America, has instituted all sorts of smart market reforms that have madeBrazil prosper.And so if you take a Bachelet or a Lula, and the United States has a good working relationshipwith them, then I think that points the way for other countries that may be where thedemocratic tradition is not as deeply embedded as we'd like it to be. And we can makecommon cause in showing those countries that, in fact, democracy, respect for propertyrights, respects for market-based economies, rule of law -- that all those things can in factlead to greater prosperity, that that's not just a U.S. agenda, but that's a smart way toincrease the prosperity of your own people.Okay, Hans Nichols. Hans.Q: Thank you, Mr. President. If I can just return to the economy more generally. When youwere selling the economic stimulus package, you talked and your advisors and economiststalked about keeping unemployment below 8 percent. Last week you acknowledged thatunemployment is likely to reach double digits, being 10 percent. Do you think you need asecond stimulus package?President Obama: Well, not yet, because I think it's important to see how the economyevolves and how effective the first stimulus is. I think it's fair to say that -- keep in mind thestimulus package was the first thing we did, and we did it a couple of weeks afterinauguration. At that point nobody understood what the depths of this recession were going tolook like. If you recall, it was only significantly later that we suddenly get a report that theeconomy had tanked.And so it's not surprising then that we missed the mark in terms of our estimates of whereunemployment would go. I think it's pretty clear now that unemployment will end up goingover 10 percent, if you just look at the pattern, because of the fact that even after employersand businesses start investing again and start hiring again, typically it takes a while for thatemployment number to catch up with economic recovery. And we're still not at actualrecovery yet.So I anticipate that this is going to be a difficult -- difficult year, a difficult period.Q: What's the high water mark, then, for unemployment? Eleven percent?President Obama: Well, I'm not suggesting that I have a crystal ball. Since you just threwback at us our last prognosis, let's not -- let's not engage in another one.Q: Does that mean you won't be making predictions ever?President Obama: But what I am saying is that -- here are some things I know for certain.In the absence of the stimulus, I think our recession would be much worse. It would havedeclined -- without the Recovery Act -- we know for a fact that states, for example, wouldhave laid off a lot more teachers, a lot more police officers, a lot more firefighters, everysingle one of those individuals whose jobs were saved.As a consequence, they are still making their mortgage payments, they are still shopping. Sowe know that the Recovery Act has had an impact.Now, what we also know is this was the worst recession since the Great Depression, andpeople are going through a very tough time right now. And I don't expect them to be satisfied.I mean, one thing that -- as I sometimes glance at the various news outlets represented here,I know that they're sometimes reporting of, oh, the administration is worried about this, ortheir poll numbers are going down there -- look, the American people have a right to feel likethis is a tough time right now. What's incredible to me is how resilient the American peoplehave been and how they are still more optimistic than the facts alone would justify, becausethis is a tough, tough period.And I don't feel satisfied with the progress that we've made. We've got to get our RecoveryAct money out faster. We've got to make sure that the programs that we've put in place areworking the way they're supposed to. I think, for example, our mortgage program hasactually helped to modify mortgages for a lot of people, but it hasn't been keeping pace withall the foreclosures that are taking place. I get letters every day from people who say, youknow, I appreciate that you put out this mortgage program, but the bank is still not letting memodify my mortgage and I'm about to lose my home. And then I've got to call my staff andteam and find out why isn't it working for these folks, and can we adjust it, can we tweak it,can we make it more aggressive?This is a very, very difficult process. And what I've got to do is to make sure that we'refocused both on the short term, how can we provide families immediate relief and jumpstartthe economy as quickly as possible; and I've got to keep my eye on the long term, and thelong term is making sure that by reforming our health care system, by passing serious energylegislation that makes us a clean energy economy, by revamping our education system, byfinally getting the financial regulatory reforms in place that are necessary for the 21st century-- by doing all those things, we've got a foundation for long-term economic growth, and wedon't end up having to juice up the economy artificially through the kinds of bubble strategiesthat helped to get us in the situation that we're in today.Okay. I've got time for two more questions. April. Where's April?Q: Right here.President Obama: There you are. How are you?Q: I'm fine. Back on the economy, Mr. President, people are criticizing this road to recoveryplan. Specifically, there are reports in The Washington Post that say that the African Americaunemployment rate will go to 20 percent by the end of this year. And then you had yourChairman of Economic Advisers say the target intervention may come next year if nothingchanges. Why not target intervention now to stop the bloodletting in the black unemploymentrate?President Obama: Look, first of all, we know that the African American unemployment rate,the Latino unemployment rate, are consistently higher than the national average. And so, ifthe economy as a whole is doing poorly, then you know that the African American communityis going to be doing poorly, and they're going to be hit even harder. And the best thing that Ican do for the African American community or the Latino community or the Asian community,whatever community, is to get the economy as a whole moving. If I don't -- hold on onesecond, let me answer the question -- if I don't do that, then I'm not going to be able to helpanybody. So that's priority number one.It is true that in certain inner-city communities, the unemployment rate is -- was already skyhigh even before this recession. The ladders available for people to enter into the job marketare even worse. And so we are interested in looking at proven programs that help people on apathway to jobs.There was a reason why right before Father's Day I went to a program here locally inWashington called Year Up, which has a proven track record of taking young, mostly minoritypeople, some of whom have graduated from high school, some maybe who've just gottentheir GED, and trained them on computers and provide them other technical skills, but alsotrain them on how to carry themselves in an office, how to write an e-mail -- some of thesocial skills that will allow them to be more employable. They've got a terrific placement rateafter this one-year program. If there are ways that we can potentially duplicate some of thoseprograms, then we're going to do so.So part of what we want to do is to find tools that will give people more opportunity, but themost important thing I can do is to lift the economy overall. And that's what my strategy isfocused on.All right. Last Question. Suzanne.Q: Thank you. Back to Iran, putting a human face on this. Over the weekend, we saw ashocking video of this woman, Neda, who had been shot in the chest and bled to death. Haveyou seen this video?President Obama: I have.Q: What's your reaction?President Obama: It's heartbreaking. It's heartbreaking. And I think that anybody who seesit knows that there's something fundamentally unjust about that.Q: We also have people on the ground who have been saying that the streets are quieter nowand that is because they feel that they're paralyzed by fear -- fear of people gone missing,fear of violence, that perhaps this is a movement that's gone underground or perhaps isdying. Do you have any concern over that?President Obama: Yes. I have concern about how peaceful demonstrators and people whowant their votes counted may be stifled from expressing those concerns. I think, as I saidbefore, there are certain international norms of freedom of speech, freedom of expression --Q: Then why won't you allow the photos --President Obama: Hold on a second, Helen. That's a different question. And I think it'simportant for us to make sure that we let the Iranian people know that we are watchingwhat's happening, that they are not alone in this process. Ultimately, though, what's going tobe most important is what happens in Iran. And we've all been struck by the courage ofpeople. And I mentioned this I think in a statement that I made a couple of days ago. Some ofyou who had been covering my campaigns know this is one of my favorite expressions, wasDr. King's expression that ""the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.""We have to believe that ultimately justice will prevail.All right. Thank you, guys.",obama
"Good morning. It is a great honor for me to join you at the New Economic School. Michelle and I are sopleased to be in Moscow. And as somebody who was born in Hawaii, I'm glad to be here in July instead ofJanuary.I know that NES is a young school, but I speak to you today with deep respect for Russia's timelessheritage. Russian writers have helped us understand the complexity of the human experience, andrecognize eternal truths. Russian painters, composers, and dancers have introduced us to new forms ofbeauty. Russian scientists have cured disease, sought new frontiers of progress, and helped us go tospace.These are contributions that are not contained by Russia's borders, as vast as those borders are. Indeed,Russia's heritage has touched every corner of the world, and speaks to the humanity that we share. Thatincludes my own country, which has been blessed with Russian immigrants for decades; we've beenenriched by Russian culture, and enhanced by Russian cooperation. And as a resident of Washington, D.C.,I continue to benefit from the contributions of Russians -- specifically, from Alexander Ovechkin. We're verypleased to have him in Washington, D.C.Here at NES, you have inherited this great cultural legacy, but your focus on economics is no lessfundamental to the future of humanity. As Pushkin said, ""Inspiration is needed in geometry just as much aspoetry."" And today, I want particularly to speak to those of you preparing to graduate. You're poised to beleaders in academia and industry; in finance and government. But before you move forward, it's worthreflecting on what has already taken place during your young lives.Like President Medvedev and myself, you're not old enough to have witnessed the darkest hours of theCold War, when hydrogen bombs were tested in the atmosphere, and children drilled in fallout shelters, andwe reached the brink of nuclear catastrophe. But you are the last generation born when the world wasdivided. At that time, the American and Soviet armies were still massed in Europe, trained and ready tofight. The ideological trenches of the last century were roughly in place. Competition in everything fromastrophysics to athletics was treated as a zero-sum game. If one person won, then the other person had tolose.And then, within a few short years, the world as it was ceased to be. Now, make no mistake: This changedid not come from any one nation. The Cold War reached a conclusion because of the actions of manynations over many years, and because the people of Russia and Eastern Europe stood up and decided thatits end would be peaceful.With the end of the Cold War, there were extraordinary expectations -- for peace and for prosperity; for newarrangements among nations, and new opportunities for individuals. Like all periods of great change, it wasa time of ambitious plans and endless possibilities. But, of course, things don't always work out exactly asplanned. Back in 1993, shortly after this school opened, one NES student summed up the difficulty ofchange when he told a reporter, and I quote him: ""The real world is not so rational as on paper."" The realworld is not so rational as on paper.Over two tumultuous decades, that truth has been borne out around the world. Great wealth has beencreated, but it has not eliminated vast pockets of crushing poverty. Poverty exists here, it exists in the UnitedStates, and it exists all around the world. More people have gone to the ballot box, but too manygovernments still fail to protect the rights of their people. Ideological struggles have diminished, but they'vebeen replaced by conflicts over tribe and ethnicity and religion. A human being with a computer can hold thesame amount of information stored in the Russian State Library, but that technology can also be used to dogreat harm.In a new Russia, the disappearance of old political and economic restrictions after the end of the SovietUnion brought both opportunity and hardship. A few prospered, but many more did not. There were toughtimes. But the Russian people showed strength and made sacrifices, and you achieved hard-earnedprogress through a growing economy and greater confidence. And despite painful times, many in EasternEurope and Russia are much better off today than 20 years ago.We see that progress here at NES -- a school founded with Western support that is now distinctly Russian;a place of learning and inquiry where the test of an idea is not whether it is Russian or American orEuropean, but whether it works. Above all, we see that progress in all of you -- young people with a youngcentury to shape as you see fit. Your lifetime coincides with this era of transition. But think about the fundamental questions asked when thisschool was founded. What kind of future is Russia going to have? What kind of future are Russia andAmerica going to have together?  What world order will replace the Cold War? Those questions still don'thave clear answers, and so now they must be answered by you -- by your generation in Russia, in America,and around the world. You get to decide. And while I cannot answer those questions for you, I can speakplainly about the future that America is seeking.To begin with, let me be clear: America wants a strong, peaceful, and prosperous Russia. This belief isrooted in our respect for the Russian people, and a shared history between our nations that goes beyondcompetition. Despite our past rivalry, our people were allies in the greatest struggle of the last century.Recently, I noted this when I was in Normandy -- for just as men from Boston and Birmingham risked all thatthey had to storm those beaches and scale those cliffs, Soviet soldiers from places like Kazan and Kievendured unimaginable hardships to repeal -- to repel an invasion, and turn the tide in the east. As PresidentJohn Kennedy said, ""No nation in history of battle ever suffered more than the Soviet Union in the SecondWorld War.""So as we honor this past, we also recognize the future benefit that will come from a strong and vibrantRussia. Think of the issues that will define your lives: security from nuclear weapons and extremism; accessto markets and opportunity; health and the environment; an international system that protects sovereigntyand human rights, while promoting stability and prosperity. These challenges demand global partnership,and that partnership will be stronger if Russia occupies its rightful place as a great power.Yet unfortunately, there is sometimes a sense that old assumptions must prevail, old ways of thinking; aconception of power that is rooted in the past rather than in the future. There is the 20th century view thatthe United States and Russia are destined to be antagonists, and that a strong Russia or a strong Americacan only assert themselves in opposition to one another. And there is a 19th century view that we aredestined to vie for spheres of influence, and that great powers must forge competing blocs to balance oneanother.These assumptions are wrong. In 2009, a great power does not show strength by dominating or demonizingother countries. The days when empires could treat sovereign states as pieces on a chess board are over.As I said in Cairo, given our independence, any world order that -- given our interdependence, any worldorder that tries to elevate one nation or one group of people over another will inevitably fail. The pursuit ofpower is no longer a zero-sum game -- progress must be shared.That's why I have called for a ""reset"" in relations between the United States and Russia. This must be morethan a fresh start between the Kremlin and the White House -- though that is important and I've hadexcellent discussions with both your President and your Prime Minister. It must be a sustained effort amongthe American and Russian people to identify mutual interests, and expand dialogue and cooperation thatcan pave the way to progress.This will not be easy. It's difficult to forge a lasting partnership between former adversaries, it's hard tochange habits that have been ingrained in our governments and our bureaucracies for decades. But Ibelieve that on the fundamental issues that will shape this century, Americans and Russians share commoninterests that form a basis for cooperation.  It is not for me to define Russia's national interests, but I can tellyou about America's national interests, and I believe that you will see that we share common ground.First, America has an interest in reversing the spread of nuclear weapons and preventing their use.In the last century, generations of Americans and Russians inherited the power to destroy nations, and theunderstanding that using that power would bring about our own destruction. In 2009, our inheritance isdifferent. You and I don't have to ask whether American and Russian leaders will respect a balance of terror-- we understand the horrific consequences of any war between our two countries. But we do have to askthis question: We have to ask whether extremists who have killed innocent civilians in New York and inMoscow will show that same restraint. We have to ask whether 10 or 20 or 50 nuclear-armed nations willprotect their arsenals and refrain from using them.This is the core of the nuclear challenge in the 21st century. The notion that prestige comes from holdingthese weapons, or that we can protect ourselves by picking and choosing which nations can have theseweapons, is an illusion. In the short period since the end of the Cold War, we've already seen India,Pakistan, and North Korea conduct nuclear tests. Without a fundamental change, do any of us truly believethat the next two decades will not bring about the further spread of these nuclear weapons?That's why America is committed to stopping nuclear proliferation, and ultimately seeking a world withoutnuclear weapons. That is consistent with our commitment under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Thatis our responsibility as the world's two leading nuclear powers. And while I know this goal won't be metsoon, pursuing it provides the legal and moral foundation to prevent the proliferation and eventual use ofnuclear weapons.We're already taking important steps to build this foundation. Yesterday, President Medvedev and I madeprogress on negotiating a new treaty that will substantially reduce our warheads and delivery systems. Werenewed our commitment to clean, safe and peaceful nuclear energy, which must be a right for all nationsthat live up to their responsibilities under the NPT. And we agreed to increase cooperation on nuclearsecurity, which is essential to achieving the goal of securing all vulnerable nuclear material within four years.As we keep our own commitments, we must hold other nations accountable for theirs. Whether America orRussia, neither of us would benefit from a nuclear arms race in East Asia or the Middle East. That's why weshould be united in opposing North Korea's efforts to become a nuclear power, and opposing Iran's effortsto acquire a nuclear weapon. And I'm pleased that President Medvedev and I agreed upon a joint threatassessment of the ballistic challenges -- ballistic missile challenges of the 21st century, including from Iranand North Korea.This is not about singling out individual nations -- it's about the responsibilities of all nations. If we fail tostand together, then the NPT and the Security Council will lose credibility, and international law will give wayto the law of the jungle. And that benefits no one. As I said in Prague, rules must be binding, violations mustbe punished, and words must mean something.The successful enforcement of these rules will remove causes of disagreement. I know Russia opposes theplanned configuration for missile defense in Europe. And my administration is reviewing these plans toenhance the security of America, Europe and the world. And I've made it clear that this system is directed atpreventing a potential attack from Iran. It has nothing to do with Russia. In fact, I want to work together withRussia on a missile defense architecture that makes us all safer. But if the threat from Iran's nuclear andballistic missile program is eliminated, the driving force for missile defense in Europe will be eliminated, andthat is in our mutual interests.Now, in addition to securing the world's most dangerous weapons, a second area where America has acritical national interest is in isolating and defeating violent extremists.For years, al Qaeda and its affiliates have defiled a great religion of peace and justice, and ruthlesslymurdered men, women and children of all nationalities and faiths. Indeed, above all, they have murderedMuslims. And these extremists have killed in Amman and Bali; Islamabad and Kabul; and they have theblood of Americans and Russians on their hands. They're plotting to kill more of our people, and they benefitfrom safe havens that allow them to train and operate -- particularly along the border of Pakistan andAfghanistan.And that's why America has a clear goal: to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda and its allies inAfghanistan and Pakistan. We seek no bases, nor do we want to control these nations. Instead, we want towork with international partners, including Russia, to help Afghans and Pakistanis advance their ownsecurity and prosperity. And that's why I'm pleased that Russia has agreed to allow the United States tosupply our coalition forces through your territory. Neither America nor Russia has an interest in anAfghanistan or Pakistan governed by the Taliban. It's time to work together on behalf of a different future -- afuture in which we leave behind the great game of the past and the conflict of the present; a future in whichall of us contribute to the security of Central Asia.Now, beyond Afghanistan, America is committed to promoting the opportunity that will isolate extremists.We are helping the Iraqi people build a better future, and leaving Iraq to the Iraqis. We're pursuing the goalof two states, Israel and Palestine, living in peace and security. We're partnering with Muslim communitiesaround the world to advance education, health, and economic development. In each of these endeavors, Ibelieve that the Russian people share our goals, and will benefit from success -- and we need to partnertogether.Now, in addition to these security concerns, the third area that I will discuss is America's interest in globalprosperity. And since we have so many economists and future businessmen and women in the room, I knowthis is of great interest to you.We meet in the midst of the worst global recession in a generation. I believe that the free market is thegreatest force for creating and distributing wealth that the world has known. But wherever the market isallowed to run rampant -- through excessive risk-taking, a lack of regulation, or corruption -- then all areendangered, whether we live on the Mississippi or on the Volga.In America, we're now taking unprecedented steps to jumpstart our economy and reform our system ofregulation. But just as no nation can wall itself off from the consequences of a global crisis, no one canserve as the sole engine of global growth. You see, during your lives, something fundamental has changed.And while this crisis has shown us the risks that come with change, that risk is overwhelmed by opportunity. Think of what's possible today that was unthinkable two decades ago. A young woman with an Internetconnection in Bangalore, India can compete with anybody anywhere in the world. An entrepreneur with astart-up company in Beijing can take his business global. An NES professor in Moscow can collaborate withcolleagues at Harvard or Stanford. That's good for all of us, because when prosperity is created in India,that's a new market for our goods; when new ideas take hold in China, that pushes our businesses toinnovate; when new connections are forged among people, all of us are enriched.There is extraordinary potential for increased cooperation between Americans and Russians. We canpursue trade that is free and fair and integrated with the wider world. We can boost investment that createsjobs in both our countries, we can forge partnerships on energy that tap not only traditional resources, likeoil and gas, but new sources of energy that will drive growth and combat climate change. All of that,Americans and Russians can do together.Now, government can promote this cooperation, but ultimately individuals must advance this cooperation,because the greatest resource of any nation in the 21st century is you. It's people; it's young peopleespecially. And the country which taps that resource will be the country that will succeed. That successdepends upon economies that function within the rule of law. As President Medvedev has rightly said, amature and effective legal system is a condition for sustained economic development. People everywhereshould have the right to do business or get an education without paying a bribe. Whether they are inAmerica or Russia or Africa or Latin America, that's not a American idea or a Russian idea -- that's howpeople and countries will succeed in the 21st century.And this brings me to the fourth issue that I will discuss -- America's interest in democratic governments thatprotect the rights of their people.By no means is America perfect. But it is our commitment to certain universal values which allows us tocorrect our imperfections, to improve constantly, and to grow stronger over time. Freedom of speech andassembly has allowed women, and minorities, and workers to protest for full and equal rights at a time whenthey were denied. The rule of law and equal administration of justice has busted monopolies, shut downpolitical machines that were corrupt, ended abuses of power. Independent media have exposed corruptionat all levels of business and government. Competitive elections allow us to change course and hold ourleaders accountable. If our democracy did not advance those rights, then I, as a person of African ancestry,wouldn't be able to address you as an American citizen, much less a President. Because at the time of ourfounding, I had no rights -- people who looked like me. But it is because of that process that I can now standbefore you as President of the United States.So around the world, America supports these values because they are moral, but also because they work.The arc of history shows that governments which serve their own people survive and thrive; governmentswhich serve only their own power do not. Governments that represent the will of their people are far lesslikely to descend into failed states, to terrorize their citizens, or to wage war on others. Governments thatpromote the rule of law, subject their actions to oversight, and allow for independent institutions are moredependable trading partners. And in our own history, democracies have been America's most enduringallies, including those we once waged war with in Europe and Asia -- nations that today live with greatsecurity and prosperity.Now let me be clear: America cannot and should not seek to impose any system of government on anyother country, nor would we presume to choose which party or individual should run a country. And wehaven't always done what we should have on that front. Even as we meet here today, America supportsnow the restoration of the democratically-elected President of Honduras, even though he has stronglyopposed American policies. We do so not because we agree with him. We do so because we respect theuniversal principle that people should choose their own leaders, whether they are leaders we agree with ornot.And that leads me to the final area that I will discuss, which is America's interest in an international systemthat advances cooperation while respecting the sovereignty of all nations.State sovereignty must be a cornerstone of international order. Just as all states should have the right tochoose their leaders, states must have the right to borders that are secure, and to their own foreign policies.That is true for Russia, just as it is true for the United States. Any system that cedes those rights will lead toanarchy. That's why we must apply this principle to all nations -- and that includes nations like Georgia andUkraine. America will never impose a security arrangement on another country. For any country to becomea member of an organization like NATO, for example, a majority of its people must choose to; they mustundertake reforms; they must be able to contribute to the Alliance's mission. And let me be clear: NATOshould be seeking collaboration with Russia, not confrontation.And more broadly, we need to foster cooperation and respect among all nations and peoples. As Presidentof the United States, I will work tirelessly to protect America's security and to advance our interests. But noone nation can meet the challenges of the 21st century on its own, nor dictate its terms to the world. That issomething that America now understands, just as Russia understands. That's why America seeks aninternational system that lets nations pursue their interests peacefully, especially when those interestsdiverge; a system where the universal rights of human beings are respected, and violations of those rightsare opposed; a system where we hold ourselves to the same standards that we apply to other nations, withclear rights and responsibilities for all.There was a time when Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin could shape the world in one meeting. Those daysare over. The world is more complex today. Billions of people have found their voice, and seek their ownmeasure of prosperity and self-determination in every corner of the planet. Over the past two decades,we've witnessed markets grow, wealth spread, and technology used to build -- not destroy. We've seen oldhatreds pass, illusions of differences between people lift and fade away; we've seen the human destiny inthe hands of more and more human beings who can shape their own destinies. Now, we must see that theperiod of transition which you have lived through ushers in a new era in which nations live in peace, andpeople realize their aspirations for dignity, security, and a better life for their children. That is America'sinterest, and I believe that it is Russia's interest as well.I know that this future can seem distant. Change is hard. In the words of that NES student back in 1993, thereal world is not so rational as on paper. But think of the change that has unfolded with the passing of time.One hundred years ago, a czar ruled Russia, and Europe was a place of empire.  When I was born,segregation was still the law of the land in parts of America, and my father's Kenya was still a colony. Whenyou were born, a school like this would have been impossible, and the Internet was only known to aprivileged few.You get to decide what comes next. You get to choose where change will take us, because the future doesnot belong to those who gather armies on a field of battle or bury missiles in the ground; the future belongsto young people with an education and the imagination to create. That is the source of power in this century.And given all that has happened in your two decades on Earth, just imagine what you can create in theyears to come.Every country charts its own course. Russia has cut its way through time like a mighty river through acanyon, leaving an indelible mark on human history as it goes. As you move this story forward, look to thefuture that can be built if we refuse to be burdened by the old obstacles and old suspicions; look to thefuture that can be built if we partner on behalf of the aspirations we hold in common. Together, we can builda world where people are protected, prosperity is enlarged, and our power truly serves progress. And it is allin your hands. Good luck to all of you.Thank you very much.",obama
"I like this. Thank you. Thank you. I think Congress needs one of those horns.  That soundspretty good. Sounds like Louis Armstrong back there.Good afternoon, everybody. It is a great honor for me to be in Accra and to speak to therepresentatives of the people of Ghana.  I am deeply grateful for the welcome that I'vereceived, as are Michelle and Malia and Sasha Obama. Ghana's history is rich, the tiesbetween our two countries are strong, and I am proud that this is my first visit to sub-Saharan Africa as President of the United States of America.I want to thank Madam Speaker and all the members of the House of Representatives forhosting us today. I want to thank President Mills for his outstanding leadership. To the formerPresidents -- Jerry Rawlings, former President Kufuor -- Vice President, Chief Justice -- thanksto all of you for your extraordinary hospitality and the wonderful institutions that you've builthere in Ghana.I'm speaking to you at the end of a long trip. I began in Russia for a summit between twogreat powers. I traveled to Italy for a meeting of the world's leading economies. And I'vecome here to Ghana for a simple reason: The 21st century will be shaped by what happensnot just in Rome or Moscow or Washington, but by what happens in Accra, as well.This is the simple truth of a time when the boundaries between people are overwhelmed byour connections. Your prosperity can expand America's prosperity. Your health and securitycan contribute to the world's health and security. And the strength of your democracy canhelp advance human rights for people everywhere.So I do not see the countries and peoples of Africa as a world apart; I see Africa as afundamental part of our interconnected world -- as partners with America on behalf of thefuture we want for all of our children. That partnership must be grounded in mutualresponsibility and mutual respect. And that is what I want to speak with you about today.We must start from the simple premise that Africa's future is up to Africans.I say this knowing full well the tragic past that has sometimes haunted this part of theworld. After all, I have the blood of Africa within me, and my family's -- my family's own storyencompasses both the tragedies and triumphs of the larger African story.Some you know my grandfather was a cook for the British in Kenya, and though he was arespected elder in his village, his employers called him ""boy"" for much of his life. He was onthe periphery of Kenya's liberation struggles, but he was still imprisoned briefly duringrepressive times. In his life, colonialism wasn't simply the creation of unnatural borders orunfair terms of trade -- it was something experienced personally, day after day, year afteryear.My father grew up herding goats in a tiny village, an impossible distance away from theAmerican universities where he would come to get an education. He came of age at a momentof extraordinary promise for Africa. The struggles of his own father's generation were givingbirth to new nations, beginning right here in Ghana.  Africans were educating and assertingthemselves in new ways, and history was on the move.But despite the progress that has been made -- and there has been considerable progress inmany parts of Africa -- we also know that much of that promise has yet to befulfilled. Countries like Kenya had a per capita economy larger than South Korea's when I wasborn. They have badly been outpaced. Disease and conflict have ravaged parts of the Africancontinent.In many places, the hope of my father's generation gave way to cynicism, even despair. Now,it's easy to point fingers and to pin the blame of these problems on others. Yes, a colonialmap that made little sense helped to breed conflict. The West has often approached Africa asa patron or a source of resources rather than a partner. But the West is not responsible forthe destruction of the Zimbabwean economy over the last decade, or wars in which childrenare enlisted as combatants. In my father's life, it was partly tribalism and patronage andnepotism in an independent Kenya that for a long stretch derailed his career, and we knowthat this kind of corruption is still a daily fact of life for far too many.Now, we know that's also not the whole story. Here in Ghana, you show us a face of Africathat is too often overlooked by a world that sees only tragedy or a need for charity. Thepeople of Ghana have worked hard to put democracy on a firmer footing, with repeatedpeaceful transfers of power even in the wake of closely contested elections.  And by the way,can I say that for that the minority deserves as much credit as the majority.  And withimproved governance and an emerging civil society, Ghana's economy has shown impressiverates of growth.This progress may lack the drama of 20th century liberation struggles, but make nomistake: It will ultimately be more significant. For just as it is important to emerge from thecontrol of other nations, it is even more important to build one's own nation.So I believe that this moment is just as promising for Ghana and for Africa as the momentwhen my father came of age and new nations were being born. This is a new moment of greatpromise. Only this time, we've learned that it will not be giants like Nkrumah and Kenyattawho will determine Africa's future. Instead, it will be you -- the men and women in Ghana'sparliament -- the people you represent. It will be the young people brimming with talent andenergy and hope who can claim the future that so many in previous generations neverrealized.Now, to realize that promise, we must first recognize the fundamental truth that you havegiven life to in Ghana: Development depends on good governance.   That is the ingredientwhich has been missing in far too many places, for far too long. That's the change that canunlock Africa's potential. And that is a responsibility that can only be met by Africans.As for America and the West, our commitment must be measured by more than just thedollars we spend. I've pledged substantial increases in our foreign assistance, which is inAfrica's interests and America's interests. But the true sign of success is not whether we are asource of perpetual aid that helps people scrape by -- it's whether we are partners in buildingthe capacity for transformational change.This mutual responsibility must be the foundation of our partnership. And today, I'll focus onfour areas that are critical to the future of Africa and the entire developing world: democracy,opportunity, health, and the peaceful resolution of conflict.First, we must support strong and sustainable democratic governments.As I -- As I said in Cairo, each nation gives life to democracy in its own way, and in line withits own traditions. But history offers a clear verdict: Governments that respect the will of theirown people, that govern by consent and not coercion, are more -- more prosperous, they aremore stable, and more successful than governments that do not.This is about more than just holding elections. It's also about what happens betweenelections.  Repression can take many forms, and too many nations, even those that haveelections, are plagued by problems that condemn their people to poverty. No country is goingto create wealth if its leaders exploit the economy to enrich themselves -- or -- or if police -- ifpolice can be bought off by drug traffickers.  No business -- No business wants to invest in aplace where the government skims 20 percent off the top -- or the head of the Port Authorityis corrupt. No person wants to live in a society where the rule of law gives way to the rule ofbrutality and bribery.  That is not democracy, that is tyranny, even if occasionally you sprinklean election in there. And now is the time for that style of governance to end.In the 21st century, capable, reliable, and transparent institutions are the key to success --strong parliaments; honest police forces; independent judges; an independent press; avibrant private sector; a civil society.  Those are the things that give life to democracy,because that is what matters in people's everyday lives.Now, time and again, Ghanaians have chosen constitutional rule over autocracy, and shown ademocratic spirit that allows the energy of your people to break through.  We see that inleaders who accept defeat graciously -- the fact that President Mills' opponents were standingbeside him last night to greet me when I came off the plane spoke volumes about Ghana;victors who resist calls to wield power against the opposition in unfair ways. We see that spiritin courageous journalists like Anas Aremeyaw Anas, who risked his life to report the truth. Wesee it in police like Patience Quaye, who helped prosecute the first human trafficker inGhana.  We see it in the young people who are speaking up against patronage, andparticipating in the political process.Across Africa, we've seen countless examples of people taking control of their destiny, andmaking change from the bottom up. We saw it in Kenya, where civil society and businesscame together to help stop post-election violence. We saw it in South Africa, where overthree-quarters of the country voted in the recent election -- the fourth since the end ofApartheid. We saw it in Zimbabwe, where the Election Support Network braved brutalrepression to stand up for the principle that a person's vote is their sacred right.Now, make no mistake: History is on the side of these brave Africans, not with those who usecoups or change constitutions to stay in power.  Africa -- Africa doesn't need strongmen; itneeds strong institutions.Now, America will not seek to impose any system of government on any other nation. Theessential truth of democracy is that each nation determines its own destiny. But what Americawill do is increase assistance for responsible individuals and responsible institutions, with afocus on supporting good governance -- on parliaments, which check abuses of power andensure that opposition voices are heard; on the rule of law, which ensures the equaladministration of justice; on civic participation, so that young people get involved; and onconcrete solutions to corruption like forensic accounting and automating services --strengthening hotlines, protecting whistle-blowers to advance transparency andaccountability.And we provide this support. I have directed my Administration to give greater attention tocorruption in our human rights reports. People everywhere should have the right to start abusiness or get an education without paying a bribe.  We have a responsibility to supportthose who act responsibly and to isolate those who don't, and that is exactly what America willdo.Now, this leads directly to our second area of partnership: supporting development thatprovides opportunity for more people.With better governance, I have no doubt that Africa holds the promise of a broader base ofprosperity. Witness the extraordinary success of Africans in my country, America. They'redoing very well. So they've got the talent, they've got the entrepreneurial spirit. The questionis, how do we make sure that they're succeeding here in their home countries? The continentis rich in natural resources. And from cell phone entrepreneurs to small farmers, Africans haveshown the capacity and commitment to create their own opportunities. But old habits mustalso be broken. Dependence on commodities -- or a single export -- has a tendency toconcentrate wealth in the hands of the few, and leaves people too vulnerable to downturns.So in Ghana, for instance, oil brings great opportunities, and you have been very responsiblein preparing for new revenue. But as so many Ghanaians know, oil cannot simply become thenew cocoa. From South Korea to Singapore, history shows that countries thrive when theyinvest in their people and in their infrastructure; when they promote multiple exportindustries, develop a skilled workforce, and create space for small and medium-sizedbusinesses that create jobs.As Africans reach for this promise, America will be more responsible in extending our hand. Bycutting costs that go to Western consultants and administration, we want to put moreresources in the hands of those who need it, while training people to do more forthemselves.  That's why our 3.5 billion dollar food security initiative is focused on newmethods and technologies for farmers -- not simply sending American producers or goods toAfrica. Aid is not an end in itself. The purpose of foreign assistance must be creating theconditions where it's no longer needed. I want to see Ghanaians not only self-sufficient infood, I want to see you exporting food to other countries and earning money. You can do that.Now, America can also do more to promote trade and investment. Wealthy nations must openour doors to goods and services from Africa in a meaningful way. That will be a commitmentof my Administration. And where there is good governance, we can broaden prosperitythrough public-private partnerships that invest in better roads and electricity; capacity-building that trains people to grow a business; financial services that reach not just the citiesbut also the poor and rural areas. This is also in our own interests -- for if people are lifted outof poverty and wealth is created in Africa, guess what? New markets will open up for our owngoods. So it's good for both.One area that holds out both undeniable peril and extraordinary promise is energy. Africagives off less greenhouse gas than any other part of the world, but it is the most threatenedby climate change. A warming planet will spread disease, shrink water resources, and depletecrops, creating conditions that produce more famine and more conflict. All of us -- particularlythe developed world -- have a responsibility to slow these trends -- through mitigation, and bychanging the way that we use energy. But we can also work with Africans to turn this crisisinto opportunity.Together, we can partner on behalf of our planet and prosperity, and help countries increaseaccess to power while skipping -- leapfrogging the dirtier phase of development. Think aboutit: Across Africa, there is bountiful wind and solar power; geothermal energy andbiofuels. From the Rift Valley to the North African deserts; from the Western coasts to SouthAfrica's crops -- Africa's boundless natural gifts can generate its own power, while exportingprofitable, clean energy abroad.These steps are about more than growth numbers on a balance sheet. They're about whethera young person with an education can get a job that supports a family; a farmer can transfertheir goods to market; an entrepreneur with a good idea can start a business. It's about thedignity of work; it's about the opportunity that must exist for Africans in the 21st century.Just as governance is vital to opportunity, it's also critical to the third area I want to talkabout: strengthening public health.In recent years, enormous progress has been made in parts of Africa. Far more people areliving productively with HIV/AIDS, and getting the drugs they need. I just saw a wonderfulclinic and hospital that is focused particularly on maternal health. But too many still die fromdiseases that shouldn't kill them. When children are being killed because of a mosquito bite,and mothers are dying in childbirth, then we know that more progress must be made.Yet because of incentives -- often provided by donor nations -- many African doctors andnurses go overseas, or work for programs that focus on a single disease. And this createsgaps in primary care and basic prevention. Meanwhile, individual Africans also have to makeresponsible choices that prevent the spread of disease, while promoting public health in theircommunities and countries.So across Africa, we see examples of people tackling these problems. In Nigeria, an Interfaitheffort of Christians and Muslims has set an example of cooperation to confront malaria. Herein Ghana and across Africa, we see innovative ideas for filling gaps in care -- for instance,through E-Health initiatives that allow doctors in big cities to support those in small towns.America will support these efforts through a comprehensive, global health strategy, becausein the 21st century, we are called to act by our conscience but also by our common interest,because when a child dies of a preventable disease in Accra, that diminishes useverywhere. And when disease goes unchecked in any corner of the world, we know that itcan spread across oceans and continents.And that's why my Administration has committed 63 billion dollars to meet these challenges --63 billion dollars.  Building on the strong efforts of President Bush, we will carry forward thefight against HIV/AIDS. We will pursue the goal of ending deaths from malaria andtuberculosis, and we will work to eradicate polio.  We will fight -- we will fight neglectedtropical disease. And we won't confront illnesses in isolation -- we will invest in public healthsystems that promote wellness and focus on the health of mothers and children.Now, as we partner on behalf of a healthier future, we must also stop the destruction thatcomes not from illness, but from human beings -- and so the final area that I will address isconflict.Let me be clear: Africa is not the crude caricature of a continent at perpetual war. But if weare honest, for far too many Africans, conflict is a part of life, as constant as the sun. Thereare wars over land and wars over resources. And it is still far too easy for those withoutconscience to manipulate whole communities into fighting among faiths and tribes.These conflicts are a millstone around Africa's neck. Now, we all have many identities -- oftribe and ethnicity; of religion and nationality. But defining oneself in opposition to someonewho belongs to a different tribe, or who worships a different prophet, has no place in the 21stcentury.  Africa's diversity should be a source of strength, not a cause for division. We are allGod's children. We all share common aspirations -- to live in peace and security; to accesseducation and opportunity; to love our families and our communities and our faith. That is ourcommon humanity.That is why we must stand up to inhumanity in our midst. It is never justified -- neverjustifiable to target innocents in the name of ideology.  It is the death sentence of a society toforce children to kill in wars. It is the ultimate mark of criminality and cowardice to condemnwomen to relentless and systemic rape. We must bear witness to the value of every child inDarfur and the dignity of every woman in the Congo. No faith or culture should condone theoutrages against them. And all of us must strive for the peace and security necessary forprogress.Africans are standing up for this future. Here, too, in Ghana we are seeing you help point theway forward. Ghanaians should take pride in your contributions to peacekeeping from Congoto Liberia to Lebanon -- and your efforts to resist the scourge of the drug trade.  We welcomethe steps that are being taken by organizations like the African Union and ECOWAS to betterresolve conflicts, to keep the peace, and support those in need. And we encourage the visionof a strong, regional security architecture that can bring effective, transnational forces to bearwhen needed.America has a responsibility to work with you as a partner to advance this vision, not just withwords, but with support that strengthens African capacity. When there's a genocide in Darfuror terrorists in Somalia, these are not simply African problems -- they are global securitychallenges, and they demand a global response.And that's why we stand ready to partner through diplomacy and technical assistance andlogistical support, and we will stand behind efforts to hold war criminals accountable. And letme be clear: Our Africa Command is focused not on establishing a foothold in the continent,but on confronting these common challenges to advance the security of America, Africa, andthe world.In Moscow, I spoke of the need for an international system where the universal rights ofhuman beings are respected, and violations of those rights are opposed. And that mustinclude a commitment to support those who resolve conflicts peacefully, to sanction and stopthose who don't, and to help those who have suffered. But ultimately, it will be vibrantdemocracies like Botswana and Ghana which roll back the causes of conflict and advance thefrontiers of peace and prosperity.As I said earlier, Africa's future is up to Africans.The people of Africa are ready to claim that future. And in my country, African Americans --including so many recent immigrants -- have thrived in every sector of society. We've done sodespite a difficult past, and we've drawn strength from our African heritage. With stronginstitutions and a strong will, I know that Africans can live their dreams in Nairobi and Lagos,Kigali, Kinshasa, Harare, and right here in Accra.You know, 52 years ago, the eyes of the world were on Ghana. And a young preacher namedMartin Luther King traveled here, to Accra, to watch the Union Jack come down and theGhanaian flag go up. This was before the march on Washington or the success of the civilrights movement in my country. Dr. King was asked how he felt while watching the birth of anation. And he said: ""It renews my conviction in the ultimate triumph of justice.""1Now that triumph must be won once more, and it must be won by you.  And I am particularlyspeaking to the young people all across Africa and right here in Ghana. In places like Ghana,young people make up over half of the population.And here is what you must know: The world will be what you make of it. You have the powerto hold your leaders accountable, and to build institutions that serve the people. You canserve in your communities, and harness your energy and education to create new wealth andbuild new connections to the world.You can conquer disease, and end conflicts, and make change from the bottom up. You can dothat. Yes you can -- because in this moment, history is on the move.But these things can only be done if all of you take responsibility for your future. And it won'tbe easy. It will take time and effort. There will be suffering and setbacks. But I can promiseyou this: America will be with you every step of the way -- as a partner, as afriend.  Opportunity won't come from any other place, though. It must come from thedecisions that all of you make, the things that you do, the hope that you hold in your heart.Ghana, freedom is your inheritance. Now, it is your responsibility to build upon freedom'sfoundation. And if you do, we will look back years from now to places like Accra and say thiswas the time when the promise was realized; this was the moment when prosperity wasforged, when pain was overcome, and a new era of progress began. This can be the timewhen we witness the triumph of justice once more.Yes we can.Thank you very much. God bless you.Thank you.",obama
"Mr. President, I rise today both humbled and honored by the opportunity to express mysupport for renewal of the expiring provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.I want to thank the many people inside and outside Congress who have worked so hard overthe past year to get us here. We owe a great debt of gratitude to the leadership on both sidesof the aisle. And we owe special thanks to Chairmen Sensenbrenner and Specter, RankingMembers Conyers and Leahy, and Representative Mel Watt. Without their work anddedication, and the support of voting rights advocates across the country, I doubt that this billwould have come before us so soon.I want to thank both Chambers and both sides of the aisle, as well, for getting this done withthe same broad support that drove the original act 40 years ago. At a time when Americansare frustrated with the partisan bickering that too often stalls our work, the refreshing displayof bipartisanship we're seeing today reflects our collective belief in the success of the act andreminds us of how effective we can be when we work together.Nobody can deny that we've come a long way since 1965. Look at the registration numbers.Only two years after the passage of the original Act, registration numbers for minority votersin some States doubled. Soon after, not a single State covered by the Voting Rights Act hadregistered less than half of its minority voting age population.Look at the influence of African-American elected officials at every single level of government.There are African-American Members of Congress. Since 2001, our Nation's top diplomat hasbeen African American. In fact, most of America's elected African-American officials comefrom States covered by section 5 of the Voting Rights Act -- States like Mississippi, andAlabama, Louisiana, and Georgia.But to me, the most striking evidence of our progress can be found right across this buildingin my dear friend Congressman John Lewis, who was on the front lines of the Civil RightsMovement, risking life and limb for freedom. And on March 7th, 1965, he led 600 peacefulprotesters, demanding the right to vote, across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama.Now, I've often thought about the people on the Edmund Pettus Bridge that day, not onlyJohn Lewis and Hosea Williams, who led the march, but the hundreds of everyday Americanswho left their homes and their churches to join it -- Blacks and Whites, teenagers, children,teachers, bankers, shopkeepers -- what Dr. King called a beloved community of God's childrenready to stand for freedom.And I wonder sometimes -- Where did they find that kind of courage? You know, when you'refacing row after row of State troopers on horseback, armed with billy clubs and tear gas --when they're coming toward you spewing hatred and violence, how do you simply stop, kneeldown, and pray to the Lord for salvation?But the most amazing thing of all is that after that day, after John Lewis was beaten within aninch of his life, after people's heads were gashed open and their eyes were burned, and theywatched their children's innocence literally beaten out of them -- after all that, they went backand marched again. They marched again. They crossed the bridge. They awakened a nation'sconscience. And not five months later the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was signed into law. Itwas reauthorized in 1970, in 1975, and 1982.Now, in 2006 John Lewis, the physical scars of those marches still visible, is an originalcosponsor of the fourth reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act. And he was joined last weekby 389 of his House colleagues in voting for its passage.There were some in the House, and there may be some in the Senate, who argue that the Actis no longer needed, that the protections of section 5's ""preclearance'' requirement"" -- arequirement that ensures certain States are upholding the right to vote -- are targeting thewrong States. Unfortunately, the evidence refutes that notion. Of the 1100 objections issuedby the Department of Justice since 1965, 56 [percent] occurred since the last reauthorizationin 1982. Over half have occurred since 1982. So despite the progress these States have madein upholding the right to vote, it's clear that problems still exist.Now, there are others who would argue that we shouldn't renew section 203's protection oflanguage minorities. These arguments have been tied to debates over immigration and theytend to muddle a noncontroversial issue -- protecting the right to vote -- with one of today'smost contentious debates. But let's remember, you can't request language assistance if you'renot a voter. And you can't be a voter if you are not a citizen. And while voters, as citizens,must be proficient in English, many are simply more confident that they can cast ballotsprinted in their native languages without making errors. It's not an unreasonable assumption.A representative of the Southwestern Voter Registration Project is quoted as saying, (quote): Citizens who prefer Spanish registration cards do so because they feel more connectedto the process. They also feel they trust the process more when they [fully] understandit.These sentiments, connection to and trust in our democratic process, are exactly what wewant from our voting rights legislation.Our challenges, of course, don't end at reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act. We have toprevent the problems we've seen in recent elections from happening again. We've seenpolitical operatives purge voters from registration rolls for no legitimate reason, preventeligible ex-felons from casting ballots, distribute polling equipment unevenly, and deceivevoters about the time, location, and rules of elections. And unfortunately, these efforts havebeen directed primarily at minority voters -- the disabled, low-income individuals, and otherhistorically disenfranchised groups.The Help America Vote Act, or HAVA, was a big step in the right direction. But we've got to domore. We need to fully fund HAVA if we're going to move forward in the next stage of securingthe right to vote for every citizen. We need to enforce critical requirements like statewideregistration databases. We need to make sure polling equipment is distributed equitably andequipment actually works. And we need to work on getting more people to the polls onelection day.We need to make sure that minority voters are not the subject of some deplorableintimidation tactics when they do go to the polls.You know, in 2004 Native American voters in South Dakota were confronted by men posing aslaw enforcement. These hired intimidators joked about jail time for ballot missteps andfollowed voters to their cars to record their license plates.[""]In Lake County, Ohio, some voters received a memo on bogus Board of Election[s]letterhead, informing voters who registered through Democratic and NAACP drives that theycould not vote.[""]In Wisconsin, a flier purporting to be from the ""Milwaukee Black Voters League"" was circulatedin predominantly African-American neighborhoods with the following message: ""If you'vealready voted in any election this year, you can't vote in the presidential election. ""If youviolate any of these laws, you can get ten years in prison and your children will get takenaway from you.""Now, think about that. We've got a lot more work to do. This occasion is a cause forcelebration. But it's also an opportunity to renew our commitment to voting rights. AsCongressman Lewis said last week: It's clear that we've come a great distance, but we stillhave a great distance to go. Now, the memory of Selma still lives on in the spirit of theVoting Rights Act. Since that day, the Voting Rights Act has been a critical tool in ensuringthat all Americans not only have the right to vote but have the right to have their votecounted.And those of us concerned about protecting those rights can't afford to sit on our laurels uponreauthorization of this bill. We need to take advantage of this rare, united front and continueto fight to ensure unimpeded access to the polls of all Americans. In other words, we need totake the spirit that existed on that bridge, and we have to spread it across this country.You know, two weeks after the first march was turned back, Dr. King spoke, and he told agathering of organizers and activists and community members -- he said that they should notdespair because ""the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.""The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice. That's because of the workthat each of us do that it bends toward justice. It's because of people like John Lewis andFannie Lou Hamer and Coretta Scott King and Rosa Parks -- all the giants upon whoseshoulders we stand -- that we are beneficiaries of that arc bending toward justice.That's why I stand here today. I would not be in the United States Senate had it not been forthe efforts and courage of so many parents and grandparents and ordinary people who werewilling to reach up and bend that arc in the direction of justice.I hope we continue to see that spirit live on not just during this debate but throughout all ourwork here in the Senate.Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.",obama
"Good morning, everybody.  Before I introduce America's next Surgeon General, I'd like to saya few words about our ongoing efforts to reform the health care system that she will helpoversee.We are now closer to the goal of health care reform than we have ever been.  Over the lastseveral weeks, key committees in the House and the Senate have made important andunprecedented progress on a plan that will lower costs, provide better care for patients, andcurb the worst practices of the insurance companies.  It's a plan that will not add to our deficitover the next decade.  Let me repeat that:  It is a plan that will not add to our deficit over thenext decade -- and eventually will help lower our deficit by slowing the skyrocketing cost ofMedicare and Medicaid.Even though we are close, I've got no illusions that it's going to be easy to get over the finishline.  There are going to be more debates and more disagreements before all is said anddone.  But health care reform must be done.I know there are those who believe we should wait to solve this problem, or take a moreincremental approach, or simply do nothing.  But this is the kind of criticism we heard whenthe country tried to pass Medicare, a program that is now providing quality care togenerations of American seniors.  It's the kind of criticism we heard when we tried to pass theChildren's Health Insurance Program, which has provided quality care and coverage to millionsof kids.  It's the same Washington thinking that has ignored big challenges and put off toughdecisions for decades.  And it is precisely that kind of small thinking that has led us into thecurrent predicament.So make no mistake:  The status quo on health care is no longer an option for the UnitedStates of America.  If we step back from this challenge right now, we will leave our children alegacy of debt -- a future of crushing costs that bankrupt our families, our businesses, andbecause we will have done nothing to bring down the cost of Medicare and Medicaid, will crushour government.  Premiums will continue to skyrocket -- placing what amounts to another taxon American families struggling to pay bills.  The insurance companies and special intereststhat have killed reform in the past will only continue to benefit even more -- and they'llcontinue to deny coverage to Americans with pre-existing medical conditions.  People willcontinue to lose health insurance just because they lose their job or they change jobs.This is a future that we cannot afford.  This country can't afford to have health care premiumsrise three times faster than people's wages, as they did over the last decade.  We can't afford14,000 Americans losing their health care every single day.  We can't afford a future whereour government will eventually spend more on Medicare and Medicaid than what we spend oneverything else.And during the campaign, I promised health care reform that would control costs, expandcoverage, and ensure choice.  And I promised that Americans making $250,000 a year or lesswould not pay more in taxes.  These are promises that we're keeping as reform movesforward.This is no longer a problem we can wait to fix.  This is about who we are as a country.  Healthcare reform is about every family's health, but it's also about the health of the economy.So I just want to put everybody on notice, because there was a lot of chatter during the weekthat I was gone:  We are going to get this done.  Inaction is not an option.  And for those nay-sayers and cynics who think that this is not going to happen, don't bet against us.  We aregoing to make this thing happen, because the American people desperately need it.And even those who are satisfied with their health care right now, they understand that ifpremiums keep on doubling and if employers keep on shedding health insurance because it'sunsustainable and if you look at the trajectory of where Medicare and Medicaid are going, theninaction will create the biggest crisis of all.And so I understand people are a little nervous and a little scared about making change.  Themuscles in this town to bring about big changes are a little atrophied, but we're whipping folksback into shape.  We are going to get this done.  And if there's anyone who understands theurgency of meeting this challenge in a personal and powerful way, it's the woman who willbecome our nation's next Surgeon General, Dr. Regina Benjamin.The list of qualifications that make Dr. Benjamin an outstanding candidate to be America'sleading spokesperson on issues of public health are long indeed.  She was in the second classat Morehouse School of Medicine and went on to earn an MD from the University of Alabamaat Birmingham and an MBA from Tulane.  She served as Associate Dean for Rural Health atthe University of South Alabama College of Medicine, and in 1995, she became the firstphysician under 40 and the first African American woman to be named to the AmericanMedical Association's Board of Trustees.  In 2002, she became President of Alabama's StateMedical Association.  And she has received numerous awards and recognitions, including theMacArthur Genius Award.  It's very impressive.But of all these achievements and experience, none has been more pertinent to today'schallenges or closer to Regina's heart than the rural health clinic that she has built and rebuiltin Bayou La Batre -- did I say that right?  Well, tell me how to say it.Dr. Benjamin:  Bayou La Batre.President Obama:  Bayou La Batre.  That's in Alabama, people.Bayou La Batre is a rural town of about 2,500 people.  It's a shrimping town, where a lot offolks work for themselves, scrape by, and can't usually afford health insurance.  And by theway, Dr. Benjamin, while we were talking in the Oval Office, described for me thedemographics of this town are actually very interesting, because you've got whites, blacks,and Asians in this community.  There are a lot of Laotians and Cambodians who have movedthere and are part of this shrimping town, so it's a diverse but very poor rural community. And like so many other rural communities, doctors and hospitals are hard to come by.  Andthat's why, even though she could have left the state to make more money as a specialist oras a doctor in a wealthier community, Regina Benjamin returned to Alabama and opened asmall clinic in Bayou La Batre.When people couldn't pay, she didn't charge them.  When the clinic wasn't making money,she didn't take a salary for herself. When Hurricane George destroyed the clinic in 1998, shemade house calls to all her patients while it was rebuilt.  When Hurricane Katrina destroyed itagain and left most of her town homeless, she mortgaged her house and maxed out her creditcards to rebuild that clinic for a second time.  She tended to those who had been wounded inthe storm, and when folks needed medicine, she asked the pharmacist to send the bill herway.And when Regina's clinic was about to open for the third time, and a fire burned it to theground before it could serve the first patient, well, you can guess what Dr. Benjamin did. With help from her community, she is rebuilding it again.  One disabled patient brought her anenvelope with $20 inside.  Another elderly man said simply, ""Maybe I can help.  I got ahammer.""For nearly two decades, Dr. Regina Benjamin has seen in a very personal way what is brokenabout our health care system.  She's seen an increasing number of patients who've had healthinsurance their entire lives suddenly lose it because they lost their jobs or because it's simplybecome too expensive.  She's been a relentless promoter of prevention and wellnessprograms, having treated too many costly and -- diseases and complications that didn't haveto happen.  And she's witnessed the shortage of primary care physicians in the rural andunderserved areas where she works.But for all that she's seen and all the tremendous obstacles that she has overcome, ReginaBenjamin also represents what's best about health care in America -- doctors and nurses whogive and care and sacrifice for the sake of their patients; those Americans who would doanything to heal a fellow citizen.  Through floods and fires and severe want, Regina Benjaminhas refused to give up.  Her patients have refused to give up.  And when we were talking inthe Oval Office, she said:  The one thing I want to do is make sure that this Surgeon General'sOffice gives voice to patients, that patients have a seat at the table; somebody is advocatingfor them and speaking for them.And now we in Washington and across America have to refuse to give up on the goal of healthcare that is affordable and accessible for every last one of us.  We don't have to deal withhurricanes and we don't have to deal with floods and we don't have to deal with fires; all wehave to do is pass a bill to make sure that the American people have a decent shot at gettingthe kind of choice and high-quality health care that's affordable.And I know that Dr. Benjamin is going to help us get there as the next Surgeon General.  AndI am truly honored to nominate her for that post, and Secretary Sebelius is equally excited,even though she's just standing here.With that, let me introduce the next Surgeon General of the United States, Dr. Regina Benjamin.",obama
"Hello, Michigan! Thank you.  Thank you so much.  First of all, give Joe a big round of applausefor the wonderful introduction. We've got some special guests here -- now, if everybody haschairs, go ahead and use them. Feel free.  We've got some special guests here today that Ijust want to acknowledge.  All of you are special, but these folks I want to make sure that youhave a chance to see them.First of all, one of the best governors in the country, please give Jennifer Granholm a biground of applause. Lieutenant Governor John Cherry -- give John a big round of applause. One of my favorite people, a former colleague of mine, still just a fighter on behalf of workingfamilies each and every day -- Senator Debbie Stabenow.  We've got Speaker of the House,Andy Dillon, in the house.  We've got a lot of other local elected officials, and I just want tothank them.A couple of people who are missing:  Carl Levin, who is doing great work.  He's in the Senateright now fighting on behalf of a bill to make sure that we're not loading up a bunch ofnecessary defense spending with unnecessary defense spending.  So he's the point person onit.  The only reason he's not here is because he is working alongside the administration to getthis bill done.  Please give him a big round of applause.  Congressman Sandy Levin, alsoworking hard on your behalf each and every day, but is not here today.  I want to go aheadand acknowledge the new mayor, since he's the new mayor -- Mayor Dave Bing, great ballplayer. My game is a little like Dave Bing's -- except I don't have the jump shot or the speedor the ball handling skills -- or the endurance.  Also don't have the afro.  Don't think I forgotthat, Dave.  I remember. I remember that.I also want to acknowledge that we've got the Executive Director of the White House Councilon Auto Communities and Workers, who's working hard, has a direct line to me each andevery day.  He's traveling constantly back here -- Ed Montgomery.  Please give Ed a big roundof applause.And the Chairman of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indian Tribe, DerekBailey is here.  Please give Derek a big round of applause.And finally, the president of the college where we are here, Jim Jacobs.  Give Jim Jacobs a biground of applause.And those of you who I've missed, you know how grateful I am that you're here.  And thankyou all.  It is wonderful to be back at Macomb.  It was terrific visiting this campus as acandidate, but I have to admit, it's even better visiting as a President.Now, this is a place where anyone -- anyone with a desire to learn and to grow, to take theircareer to a new level or start a new career altogether -- has the opportunity to pursue theirdream, right here in Macomb.  This is a place where people of all ages and all backgrounds --even in the face of obstacles, even in the face of very difficult personal challenges -- can takea chance on a brighter future for themselves and their families.There are folks like Joe, who just told us his story.  When Joe lost his job, he decided to takeadvantage of assistance for displaced workers.  He earned his associate degree here atMacomb, and with a pretty impressive GPA, I might add.  And with the help of that degree,Joe found a new job, working for the new Henry Ford West Bloomfield Hospital as amaintenance mechanic, using the skills he learned here and the talents that he brought tomake a fresh start.There are workers like Kellie Kulman, who is here today. Where's Kellie?  Raise your hand,Kellie.  Where are you?  There you are.  There's Kellie right there.  Kellie is a UAW worker at aFord plant in Sterling Heights, Michigan.  She used to drive a fork lift, right?  But then shedecided to train here at Macomb for a job that required new skills, and now she's anapprentice pipe fitter.  It's a telling example:  Even as this painful restructuring takes place inour auto industry, workers are seeking out training for new auto jobs.  And Joe and Kellie'sstory make clear what all of you know:  Community colleges are an essential part of ourrecovery in the present -- and our prosperity in the future.  This place can make the futurebetter, not just for these individuals but for America.Now, since this recession began 20 months ago, 6.5 million Americans have lost their jobs,and I don't have to tell you Michigan in particular has been hard-hit.  Now, I -- the statisticsare daunting.  The whole country now, the unemployment rate is approaching 10 percent. Here in Michigan, it's about five points higher.  And new jobs of course are going to be comingout and we're going to see continuing job loss even as the economy is beginning to stabilize.Now, that's not just abstractions.  Those just aren't numbers on a page.  Those areextraordinary hardships, tough times, for families and individuals who've worked hard all theirlives and have done the right things all their lives.  If you haven't lost a job, chances are youknow somebody who has:  a family member, a neighbor, a friend, a coworker.  And you knowthat as difficult as the financial struggle can be, the sense of loss is about more than just apaycheck, because most of us define ourselves by the work we do.  That's part of what itmeans to be an American.  We take pride in work -- that sense that you're contributing,supporting your family, meeting your responsibilities.  People need work not just for income,but because it makes you part of that fabric of a community that's so important.  And so whenyou lose your job, and when entire communities are losing thousands of jobs, that's a heavyburden, that's a heavy weight.Now, my administration has a job to do, as well, and that job is to get this economy back onits feet.  That's my job. And it's a job I gladly accept.  I love these folks who helped get us inthis mess and then suddenly say, well, this is Obama's economy.  That's fine.  Give it to me. My job is to solve problems, not to stand on the sidelines and harp and gripe.So I welcome the job.  I want the responsibility.  And I know that -- let's just take anexample.  Many questioned our efforts to help save GM and Chrysler from collapse earlier thisyear.  Their feeling was these companies were driven to the brink by poor managementdecisions over a long period of time, and like any business they should be held accountable forthose decisions.  I agree that they should be held accountable.  But I also recognize thehistoric significance and economic prominence of these companies in communities all acrossMichigan and all across the country.I thought about the hundreds of thousands of Americans whose livelihoods are still connectedto the American auto industry, and the impact on an already struggling economy, especiallyright here in Michigan.  So I said that if Chrysler and GM were willing to fundamentallyrestructure their businesses and make the hard choices necessary to become competitive nowand in the future, it was a process worth supporting.Now today, after a painful period of soul-searching and sacrifice, both GM and Chrysler haveemerged from bankruptcy.  Remember, folks said there was no way they could do it?  They'vegotten it done already, in record time -- far faster than anybody thought possible.  They'vegot a leaner structure, they've got new management, and a viable vision of how to competeand win in the 21st century.  Those sacrifices were shared among all the stakeholders: workers and management; creditors and shareholders; retirees and communities.  Andtogether, they've made the rebirth of Chrysler and GM possible.It was the right thing to do.But even with this positive news, the hard truth is, is that some of the jobs that have beenlost in the auto industry and elsewhere won't be coming back.  They're the casualties of achanging economy.  In some cases, just increased productivity in the plants themselvesmeans that some jobs aren't going to return.  And that only underscores the importance ofgenerating new businesses and new industries to replace the ones that we've lost, and ofpreparing our workers to fill the jobs they create.  For even before this recession hit, we werefaced with an economy that was simply not creating or sustaining enough new, well-payingjobs.So now is the time to change all that.  What we face is far more than a passing crisis.  This isa transformative moment.  And in this moment we must do what other generations havedone.  It's not the time to shrink from the challenges we face or put off tough decisions. That's what Washington has done for decades, and it's exactly why I ran for President -- tochange that mindset.  Now is the time to build a firmer, stronger foundation for growth thatwill not only withstand future economic storms, but that will help us thrive and compete in aglobal economy.  To build that foundation, we have to slow the growth of health care coststhat are driving us into debt.  We're going to have to do that, and there's going to be a majordebate over the next three weeks.  And don't be fooled by folks trying to scare you, saying wecan't change the health care system.  We have no choice but to change the health caresystem, because right now it's broken for too many Americans.We're going to have to make tough choices necessary to bring down deficits.  But don't letfolks fool you -- the best way to start bringing down deficits is to get control of our health carecosts, which is why we need reform.Now is the time to create the jobs of the future by growing industries, including a new cleanenergy economy.  And Jennifer Granholm has been all on top of this as the governor ofMichigan.  She is bring cleaning [sic] energy jobs right here to Michigan, and we've got tosupport her in that effort.I want Michigan to build windmills and wind turbines and solar panels and biofuel plants andenergy-efficient light bulbs and weatherize all our -- because, Michigan, you know badweather.  So you can be all on top of weatherizing.  You need to weatherize.  I know aboutthat in Chicago too.But we also have to ensure that we're educating and preparing our people for the new jobs ofthe 21st century.  We've got to prepare our people with the skills they need to compete in thisglobal economy. Time and again, when we placed our bet for the future on education, wehave prospered as a result -- by tapping the incredible innovative and generative potential ofa skilled American workforce.  That's what happened when President Lincoln signed into lawlegislation creating the land grant colleges, which not only transformed higher education, butalso our entire economy.  That's what took place when President Roosevelt signed the GI Billwhich helped educate a generation, and ushered in an era of unprecedented prosperity.  Thatwas the foundation for the American middle class.And that's why, at the start of my administration I set a goal for America:  By 2020, thisnation will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world.  We usedto have that.  We're going to have it again. And we've begun to take historic steps to achievethis goal.  Already we've increased Pell grants by $500. We've created a $2,500 tax credit forfour years of college tuition. We've simplified student aid applications and ensured that aid isnot based on the income of a job that you just lost. A new GI Bill of Rights for the 21stcentury is beginning to help soldiers coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan to begin a newlife -- in a new economy.  And the recovery plan has helped close state budget shortfalls --which put enormous pressure on public universities and community colleges -- at the sametime making historic investments in school libraries and classrooms and facilities all acrossAmerica.  So we've already taken some steps that are building the foundation for a 21stcentury education system here in America, one that will allow us to compete with China andIndia and everybody else all around the world.But today I'm announcing the most significant down payment yet on reaching the goal ofhaving the highest college graduation rate of any nation in the world.  We're going to achievethis in the next 10 years.  And it's called the American Graduation Initiative.  It will reformand strengthen community colleges like this one from coast to coast so they get the resourcesthat students and schools need -- and the results workers and businesses demand.  Throughthis plan, we seek to help an additional 5 million Americans earn degrees and certificates inthe next decade -- 5 million.Not since the passage of the original GI Bill and the work of President Truman's Commissionon Higher Education -- which helped to double the number of community colleges andincrease by seven-fold enrollment in those colleges -- have we taken such a historic step onbehalf of community colleges in America.  And let me be clear:  We pay for this plan -- thisisn't adding to the deficit; we're paying for this plan -- by ending the wasteful subsidies wecurrently provide to banks and private lenders for student loans.  That will save tens of billionsof dollars over the next 10 years.  Instead of lining the pockets of special interests, it's timethis money went towards the interests of higher education in America.  That's what myadministration is committed to doing.Now, I know that for a long time there have been politicians who have spoken of training as asilver bullet and college as a cure-all.  It's not, and we know that.  I can't tell you how manyworkers who've been laid off, you talk to them about training and they say, ""Training forwhat?""  So I understand the frustrations that a lot of people have, especially if the training isnot well designed for the specific jobs that are being created out there.But we know that in the coming years, jobs requiring at least an associate degree areprojected to grow twice as fast as jobs requiring no college experience.  We will not fill thosejobs -- or even keep those jobs here in America -- without the training offered by communitycolleges.  That's why I want to applaud Governor Granholm for the No Worker Left Behindprogram.  It's providing up to two years' worth of free tuition at community colleges anduniversities across the state.  The rest of the country should learn from the effort.This is training to become a medical technician, or a health IT worker, or a lab specialist, or anurse.  In fact, 59 percent of all new nurses come from community colleges.  This is trainingto install solar panels and build those wind turbines we were talking about and develop asmarter electricity grid.  And this is the kind of education that more and more Americans areusing to improve their skills and broaden their horizons.  Many young people are savingmoney by spending two years at community college before heading to a four-year college. And more workers who have lost their jobs -- or fear losing a job -- are seeking an edge atschools like this one.At the same time, community colleges are under increasing pressure to cap enrollments andscrap courses and cut costs as states and municipalities face budget shortfalls.  And this is inaddition to the challenges you face in the best of times, as these schools receive far lessfunding per student than typical four-year colleges and universities.  So community collegesare an undervalued asset in our country.  Not only is that not right, it's not smart.  That's whyI've asked Dr. Jill Biden -- who happens to be a relation of the Vice President, Joe Biden, butwho is also a community college educator for more than 16 years -- to promote communitycolleges and help us make community colleges stronger.  And that's why we're putting inplace this American Graduation Initiative.Let me describe for you the specifics of what we're going to do.  Number one, we will offercompetitive grants, challenging community colleges to pursue innovative, results-orientedstrategies in exchange for federal funding.  We'll fund programs that connect students lookingfor jobs with businesses that are looking to hire.  We'll challenge these schools to find newand better ways to help students catch up on the basics, like math and science, that areessential to our competitiveness.  We'll put colleges and employers together to createprograms that match curricula in the classroom with the needs of the boardroom.These are all kinds of -- there are all kinds of examples of what's possible.  We've seen Cisco,for example, working with community colleges to prepare students and workers for jobsranging from work in broadband to health IT.  We know that the most successful communitycolleges are those that partner with the private sector.  So we want to encourage morecompanies to work with schools to build these type of relationships.  That way, whensomebody goes through a training program, they know that there's a job at the end of thattraining.We'll also create a new research center with a simple mission:  to measure what works andwhat doesn't.  All too often, we don't know what happens when somebody walks out of aclassroom and onto the factory floor or into the library or -- the laboratory or the office.  Andthat means businesses often can't be sure what a degree is really worth.  And schoolsthemselves don't have the facts to make informed choices about which programs receive --achieve results and which programs don't.  And this is important, not just for businesses andcolleges, but for students and workers, as well.  If a parent is going to spend time in theclassroom and away from his or her family -- especially after a long day at work -- thatdegree really has to mean something.They have to know that when they get that degree, this is going to help advance their goals. If a worker is going to spend two years training to enter into a whole new profession, thatcertificate has to mean that he or she is ready, and that businesses are ready to hire.In addition, we want to propose new funding for innovative strategies that promote not justenrollment in a community college program, but completion of that program.  See, more thanhalf -- more than half of all students who enter community college to earn an associatedegree, or transfer to a four-year school to earn a bachelor's degree, unfortunately fail toreach their goal.  That's not just a waste of a valuable resource, that's a tragedy for thesestudents.  Oftentimes they've taken out debt and they don't get the degree, but they still haveto pay back the debt.  And it's a disaster for our economy.So we'll fund programs that track student progress inside and outside the classroom.  Let'sfigure out what's keeping students from crossing that finish line, and then put in place reformsthat will remove those barriers.  Maybe it becomes too difficult for a parent to be away fromhome, or too expensive for a waiter or a nurse to miss a shift.  Maybe a young student justisn't sure if her education will lead to employment.  The point is, we need to figure outsolutions for these kinds of challenges -- because facing these impediments shouldn't preventyou from reaching your potential.All right, so that's a big chunk of this first part of this initiative.  The second part:  We're goingto back $10 billion in loans to renovate and rebuild college classrooms and buildings all acrossthe country. All too often, community colleges are treated like the stepchild of the highereducation system; they're an afterthought, if they're thought of at all.  And that meansschools are often years behind in the facilities they provide, which means, in a 21st centuryeconomy, they're years behind in the education they can offer.  That's a mistake and it's onethat we'll help to correct.  Through this fund, schools will have the chance to borrow at a moreaffordable rate to modernize facilities, and they'll be building on the funds in the recovery planthat are already helping to renovate schools, including community colleges all across thecountry.  And by the way, not only does this improve the schools and the training that they'reproviding, guess what?  You also have to hire some workers and some tradesmen and womento do the work on those schools.  So it means it's putting people to work in Michigan righthere right now.Number three:  Even as we repair bricks and mortar, we have an opportunity to build a newvirtual infrastructure to complement the education and training community colleges can offer. So we're going to support the creation of a new online, open-source clearinghouse of coursesso that community colleges across the country can offer more classes without building moreclassrooms.  And this will make a big difference especially for rural campuses that a lot oftimes have struggled -- attract -- have to struggle to attract students and faculty.  And thiswill make it possible for a professor to complement his lecture with an online exercise, or for astudent who can't be away from her family to still keep up with her coursework.We don't know where this kind of experiment will lead, but that's exactly why we ought to tryit because I think there's a possibility that online education can provide especially for peoplewho are already in the workforce and want to retrain the chance to upgrade their skillswithout having to quit their job.So let me say this more:  The road to recovery, the road to prosperity, is going to be hard.  Itwas never going to be easy.  When I was sworn in, we were seeing 700 [thousand] jobs lostthat month.  Then we had the same amount lost for two more consecutive months.  Nowwe've got an average of about 400,000 jobs lost -- but we're still losing too many jobs.  Wewill get to the point where we're not losing jobs, but then we've got to start getting to thepoint where we're actually creating jobs.And it's going to take time.  There are going to be false starts and there are going to besetbacks.  But I am confident that we can meet the challenges we face, because that's whatwe've always done.  That's what America does.  We hit some challenges, we fuss and argueabout it, and then we go ahead and go about the business of solving our problems.  That'swhat we see on display right here at Macomb Community College.  That's what I've seen atcolleges and universities all across this country.  At every juncture in our history when we'vebeen challenged, we have summoned the resilience and the industriousness -- that can-doAmerican spirit -- that has allowed us to succeed in the face of even the toughest odds.That's what we can and must do now, not just to overcome this crisis, but to leave somethingbetter behind, to lay a foundation on which our children and our grandchildren can prosperand take responsibility for their future -- just as the students at this school, at this difficultmoment, are taking responsibility for theirs.I am absolutely confident that if I've got your help, that we can make it happen, and we aregoing to see a stronger, more prosperous Michigan in the years to come.Thank you very much, Warren.  God bless you.  God bless the United States of America.",obama
"Today we say goodbye to the youngest child of Rose and Joseph Kennedy. The world will long remembertheir son Edward as the heir to a weighty legacy; a champion for those who had none; the soul of theDemocratic Party; and the lion of the U.S. Senate -- a man whose name graces nearly one thousand laws,and who penned more than three hundred himself. But those of us who loved him, and ache with his passing, know Ted Kennedy by the other titles he held:Father. Brother. Husband. Uncle Teddy, or as he was often known to his younger nieces and nephews,""The Grand Fromage,"" or ""The Big Cheese."" I, like so many others in the city where he worked for nearlyhalf a century, knew him as a colleague, a mentor, and above all, a friend.Ted Kennedy was the baby of the family who became its patriarch; the restless dreamer who became itsrock. He was the sunny, joyful child, who bore the brunt of his brothers' teasing, but learned quickly how tobrush it off. When they tossed him off a boat because he didn't know what a jib was, six-year-old Teddy gotback in and learned to sail. When a photographer asked the newly-elected Bobby to step back at a pressconference because he was casting a shadow on his younger brother, Teddy quipped, ""It'll be the same inWashington.""This spirit of resilience and good humor would see Ted Kennedy through more pain and tragedy than mostof us will ever know. He lost two siblings by the age of sixteen. He saw two more taken violently from thecountry that loved them. He said goodbye to his beloved sister, Eunice, in the final days of his own life. Henarrowly survived a plane crash, watched two children struggle with cancer, buried three nephews, andexperienced personal failings and setbacks in the most public way possible. It is a string of events that would have broken a lesser man. And it would have been easy for Teddy to lethimself become bitter and hardened; to surrender to self-pity and regret; to retreat from public life and liveout his years in peaceful quiet. No one would have blamed him for that. But that was not Ted Kennedy. As he told us, ""...Individual faults and frailties are no excuse to give in - andno exemption from the common obligation to give of ourselves."" Indeed, Ted was the ""Happy Warrior"" thatthe poet William Wordsworth spoke of when he wrote:As tempted more; more able to endure,As more exposed to suffering and distress;Thence, also, more alive to tenderness.Through his own suffering, Ted Kennedy became more alive to the plight and suffering of others -- the sickchild who could not see a doctor; the young soldier sent to battle without armor; the citizen denied her rightsbecause of what she looks like or who she loves or where she comes from. The landmark laws that hechampioned -- the Civil Rights Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, immigration reform, children's healthcare, the Family and Medical Leave Act -- all have a running thread. Ted Kennedy's life's work was not tochampion those with wealth or power or special connections. It was to give a voice to those who were notheard; to add a rung to the ladder of opportunity; to make real the dream of our founding. He was given thegift of time that his brothers were not, and he used that gift to touch as many lives and right as many wrongsas the years would allow. We can still hear his voice bellowing through the Senate chamber, face reddened, fist pounding the podium,a veritable force of nature, in support of health care or workers' rights or civil rights. And yet, while hiscauses became deeply personal, his disagreements never did. While he was seen by his fiercest critics as apartisan lightning rod, that is not the prism through which Ted Kennedy saw the world, nor was it the prismthrough which his colleagues saw him. He was a product of an age when the joy and nobility of politicsprevented differences of party and philosophy from becoming barriers to cooperation and mutual respect --a time when adversaries still saw each other as patriots. And that's how Ted Kennedy became the greatest legislator of our time. He did it by hewing to principle, butalso by seeking compromise and common cause -- not through deal-making and horse-trading alone, butthrough friendship, and kindness, and humor. There was the time he courted Orrin Hatch's support for theChildren's Health Insurance Program by having his Chief of Staff serenade the Senator with a song Orrinhad written himself; the time he delivered shamrock cookies on a china plate to sweeten up a crustyRepublican colleague; and the famous story of how he won the support of a Texas Committee Chairman onan immigration bill. Teddy walked into a meeting with a plain manila envelope, and showed only theChairman that it was filled with the Texan's favorite cigars. When the negotiations were going well, he wouldinch the envelope closer to the Chairman. When they weren't, he would pull it back. Before long, the dealwas done.It was only a few years ago, on St. Patrick's Day, when Teddy buttonholed me on the floor of the Senate formy support on a certain piece of legislation that was coming up for vote. I gave him my pledge, butexpressed my skepticism that it would pass. But when the roll call was over, the bill garnered the votes itneeded, and then some. I looked at Teddy with astonishment and asked how he had pulled it off. He justpatted me on the back, and said ""Luck of the Irish!""Of course, luck had little to do with Ted Kennedy's legislative success, and he knew that. A few years ago,his father-in-law told him that he and Daniel Webster just might be the two greatest senators of all time.Without missing a beat, Teddy replied, ""What did Webster do?""But though it is Ted Kennedy's historic body of achievements we will remember, it is his giving heart that wewill miss. It was the friend and colleague who was always the first to pick up the phone and say, ""I'm sorryfor your loss,"" or ""I hope you feel better,"" or ""What can I do to help?"" It was the boss who was so adored byhis staff that over five hundred spanning five decades showed up for his 75th birthday party. It was the manwho sent birthday wishes and thank you notes and even his own paintings to so many who never imaginedthat a U.S. Senator would take the time to think about someone like them. I have one of those paintings inmy private study -- a Cape Cod seascape that was a gift to a freshman legislator who happened to admire itwhen Ted Kennedy welcomed him into his office the first week he arrived in Washington; by the way, that'smy second favorite gift from Teddy and Vicki after our dog Bo. And it seems like everyone has one of thosestories - the ones that often start with ""You wouldn't believe who called me today.""Ted Kennedy was the father who looked after not only his own three children, but John's and Bobby's aswell. He took them camping and taught them to sail. He laughed and danced with them at birthdays andweddings; cried and mourned with them through hardship and tragedy; and passed on that same sense ofservice and selflessness that his parents had instilled in him. Shortly after Ted walked Caroline down theaisle and gave her away at the altar, he received a note from Jackie that read, ""On you the carefreeyoungest brother fell a burden a hero would have begged to be spared. We are all going to make it becauseyou were always there with your love.""Not only did the Kennedy family make it because of Ted's love -- he made it because of theirs; andespecially because of the love and the life he found in Vicki. After so much loss and so much sorrow, itcould not have been easy for Ted Kennedy to risk his heart again. That he did is a testament to how deeplyhe loved this remarkable woman from Louisiana. And she didn't just love him back. As Ted would oftenacknowledge, Vicki saved him. She gave him strength and purpose; joy and friendship; and stood by himalways, especially in those last, hardest days. We cannot know for certain how long we have here. We cannot foresee the trials or misfortunes that will testus along the way. We cannot know God's plan for us. What we can do is to live out our lives as best we can with purpose, and love, and joy. We can use eachday to show those who are closest to us how much we care about them, and treat others with the kindnessand respect that we wish for ourselves. We can learn from our mistakes and grow from our failures. And wecan strive at all costs to make a better world, so that someday, if we are blessed with the chance to lookback on our time here, we can know that we spent it well; that we made a difference; that our fleetingpresence had a lasting impact on the lives of other human beings.This is how Ted Kennedy lived. This is his legacy. He once said of his brother Bobby that he need not beidealized or enlarged in death beyond what he was in life, and I imagine he would say the same abouthimself. The greatest expectations were placed upon Ted Kennedy's shoulders because of who he was, buthe surpassed them all because of who he became. We do not weep for him today because of the prestigeattached to his name or his office. We weep because we loved this kind and tender hero who perseveredthrough pain and tragedy -- not for the sake of ambition or vanity; not for wealth or power; but only for thepeople and the country he loved. In the days after September 11th, Teddy made it a point to personally call each one of the 177 families ofthis state who lost a loved one in the attack. But he didn't stop there. He kept calling and checking up onthem. He fought through red tape to get them assistance and grief counseling. He invited them sailing,played with their children, and would write each family a letter whenever the anniversary of that terrible daycame along. To one widow, he wrote the following:As you know so well, the passage of time never really heals the tragic memory of such a great loss,but we carry on, because we have to, because our loved one would want us to, and because thereis still light to guide us in the world from the love they gave us.We carry on. Ted Kennedy has gone home now, guided by his faith and by the light of those he has loved and lost. At lasthe is with them once more, leaving those of us who grieve his passing with the memories he gave, the goodhe did, the dream he kept alive, and a single, enduring image -- the image of a man on a boat; white manetousled; smiling broadly as he sails into the wind, ready for what storms may come, carrying on towardsome new and wondrous place just beyond the horizon. May God Bless Ted Kennedy, and may he rest ineternal peace.",obama
"Hello, everybody! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. All right, everybody goahead and have a seat. How is everybody doing today? How about Tim Spicer? I am here withstudents at Wakefield High School in Arlington, Virginia. And we've got students tuning infrom all across America, from kindergarten through 12th grade. And I am just so glad that allcould join us today. And I want to thank Wakefield for being such an outstanding host. Giveyourselves a big round of applause.I know that for many of you, today is the first day of school. And for those of you inkindergarten, or starting middle or high school, it's your first day in a new school, so it'sunderstandable if you're a little nervous. I imagine there are some seniors out there who arefeeling pretty good right now -- with just one more year to go. And no matter what gradeyou're in, some of you are probably wishing it were still summer and you could've stayed inbed just a little bit longer this morning.I know that feeling. When I was young, my family lived overseas. I lived in Indonesia for afew years. And my mother, she didn't have the money to send me where all the American kidswent to school, but she thought it was important for me to keep up with an Americaneducation. So she decided to teach me extra lessons herself, Monday through Friday. Butbecause she had to go to work, the only time she could do it was at 4:30 in the morning.Now, as you might imagine, I wasn't too happy about getting up that early. And a lot of times,I'd fall asleep right there at the kitchen table. But whenever I'd complain, my mother wouldjust give me one of those looks and she'd say, ""This is no picnic for me either, buster.""So I know that some of you are still adjusting to being back at school. But I'm here todaybecause I have something important to discuss with you. I'm here because I want to talk withyou about your education and what's expected of all of you in this new school year.Now, I've given a lot of speeches about education. And I've talked about responsibility a lot.I've talked about teachers' responsibility for inspiring students and pushing you to learn.I've talked about your parents' responsibility for making sure you stay on track, and you getyour homework done, and don't spend every waking hour in front of the TV or with the Xbox.I've talked a lot about your government's responsibility for setting high standards, andsupporting teachers and principals, and turning around schools that aren't working, wherestudents aren't getting the opportunities that they deserve.But at the end of the day, we can have the most dedicated teachers, the most supportiveparents, the best schools in the world -- and none of it will make a difference, none of it willmatter unless all of you fulfill your responsibilities, unless you show up to those schools,unless you pay attention to those teachers, unless you listen to your parents andgrandparents and other adults and put in the hard work it takes to succeed. That's what Iwant to focus on today: the responsibility each of you has for your education.I want to start with the responsibility you have to yourself. Every single one of you hassomething that you're good at. Every single one of you has something to offer. And you havea responsibility to yourself to discover what that is. That's the opportunity an education canprovide.Maybe you could be a great writer -- maybe even good enough to write a book or articles in anewspaper -- but you might not know it until you write that English paper -- that English classpaper that's assigned to you. Maybe you could be an innovator or an inventor -- maybe evengood enough to come up with the next iPhone or the new medicine or vaccine -- but youmight not know it until you do your project for your science class. Maybe you could be amayor or a senator or a Supreme Court justice -- but you might not know that until you joinstudent government or the debate team.And no matter what you want to do with your life, I guarantee that you'll need an education todo it. You want to be a doctor, or a teacher, or a police officer? You want to be a nurse or anarchitect, a lawyer or a member of our military? You're going to need a good education forevery single one of those careers. You cannot drop out of school and just drop into a good job.You've got to train for it and work for it and learn for it.And this isn't just important for your own life and your own future. What you make of youreducation will decide nothing less than the future of this country. The future of Americadepends on you. What you're learning in school today will determine whether we as a nationcan meet our greatest challenges in the future.You'll need the knowledge and problem-solving skills you learn in science and math to curediseases like cancer and AIDS, and to develop new energy technologies and protect ourenvironment. You'll need the insights and critical-thinking skills you gain in history and socialstudies to fight poverty and homelessness, crime and discrimination, and make our nationmore fair and more free. You'll need the creativity and ingenuity you develop in all yourclasses to build new companies that will create new jobs and boost our economy.We need every single one of you to develop your talents and your skills and your intellect soyou can help us old folks solve our most difficult problems. If you don't do that -- if you quiton school -- you're not just quitting on yourself, you're quitting on your country.Now, I know it's not always easy to do well in school. I know a lot of you have challenges inyour lives right now that can make it hard to focus on your schoolwork.I get it. I know what it's like. My father left my family when I was two years old, and I wasraised by a single mom who had to work and who struggled at times to pay the bills andwasn't always able to give us the things that other kids had. There were times when I missedhaving a father in my life. There were times when I was lonely and I felt like I didn't fit in.So I wasn't always as focused as I should have been on school, and I did some things I'm notproud of, and I got in more trouble than I should have. And my life could have easily taken aturn for the worse.But I was -- I was lucky. I got a lot of second chances, and I had the opportunity to go tocollege and law school and follow my dreams. My wife, our First Lady Michelle Obama, she hasa similar story. Neither of her parents had gone to college, and they didn't have a lot ofmoney. But they worked hard, and she worked hard, so that she could go to the best schoolsin this country.Some of you might not have those advantages. Maybe you don't have adults in your life whogive you the support that you need. Maybe someone in your family has lost their job andthere's not enough money to go around. Maybe you live in a neighborhood where you don'tfeel safe, or have friends who are pressuring you to do things you know aren't right.But at the end of the day, the circumstances of your life -- what you look like, where youcome from, how much money you have, what you've got going on at home -- none of that isan excuse for neglecting your homework or having a bad attitude in school. That's no excusefor talking back to your teacher, or cutting class, or dropping out of school. There is no excusefor not trying.Where you are right now doesn't have to determine where you'll end up. No one's written yourdestiny for you, because here in America, you write your own destiny. You make your ownfuture.That's what young people like you are doing every day, all across America.Young people like Jazmin Perez, from Roma, Texas. Jazmin didn't speak English when she firststarted school. Neither of her parents had gone to college. But she worked hard, earned goodgrades, and got a scholarship to Brown University -- is now in graduate school, studyingpublic health, on her way to becoming Dr. Jazmin Perez.I'm thinking about Andoni Schultz, from Los Altos, California, who's fought brain cancer sincehe was three. He's had to endure all sorts of treatments and surgeries, one of which affectedhis memory, so it took him much longer -- hundreds of extra hours -- to do his schoolwork.But he never fell behind. He's headed to college this fall.And then there's Shantell Steve, from my hometown of Chicago, Illinois. Even when bouncingfrom foster home to foster home in the toughest neighborhoods in the city, she managed toget a job at a local health care center, start a program to keep young people out of gangs,and she's on track to graduate high school with honors and go on to college.And Jazmin, Andoni, and Shantell aren't any different from any of you. They face challenges intheir lives just like you do. In some cases they've got it a lot worse off than many of you. Butthey refused to give up. They chose to take responsibility for their lives, for their education,and set goals for themselves. And I expect all of you to do the same.That's why today I'm calling on each of you to set your own goals for your education -- and doeverything you can to meet them. Your goal can be something as simple as doing all yourhomework, paying attention in class, or spending some time each day reading a book. Maybeyou'll decide to get involved in an extracurricular activity, or volunteer in your community.Maybe you'll decide to stand up for kids who are being teased or bullied because of who theyare or how they look, because you believe, like I do, that all young people deserve a safeenvironment to study and learn. Maybe you'll decide to take better care of yourself so you canbe more ready to learn. And along those lines, by the way, I hope all of you are washing yourhands a lot, and that you stay home from school when you don't feel well, so we can keeppeople from getting the flu this fall and winter.But whatever you resolve to do, I want you to commit to it. I want you to really work at it.I know that sometimes you get that sense from TV that you can be rich and successfulwithout any hard work -- that your ticket to success is through rapping or basketball or beinga reality TV star. Chances are you're not going to be any of those things.The truth is, being successful is hard. You won't love every subject that you study. You won'tclick with every teacher that you have. Not every homework assignment will seem completelyrelevant to your life right at this minute. And you won't necessarily succeed at everything thefirst time you try.That's okay. Some of the most successful people in the world are the ones who've had themost failures. J.K. Rowling's -- who wrote Harry Potter -- her first Harry Potter book wasrejected 12 times before it was finally published. Michael Jordan was cut from his high schoolbasketball team. He lost hundreds of games and missed thousands of shots during his career.But he once said, ""I have failed over and over and over again in my life. And that's why Isucceed.""These people succeeded because they understood that you can't let your failures define you --you have to let your failures teach you. You have to let them show you what to do differentlythe next time. So if you get into trouble, that doesn't mean you're a troublemaker, it meansyou need to try harder to act right. If you get a bad grade, that doesn't mean you're stupid, itjust means you need to spend more time studying.No one's born being good at all things. You become good at things through hard work. You'renot a varsity athlete the first time you play a new sport. You don't hit every note the first timeyou sing a song. You've got to practice. The same principle applies to your schoolwork. Youmight have to do a math problem a few times before you get it right. You might have to readsomething a few times before you understand it. You definitely have to do a few drafts of apaper before it's good enough to hand in.Don't be afraid to ask questions. Don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it. I do thatevery day. Asking for help isn't a sign of weakness, it's a sign of strength because it showsyou have the courage to admit when you don't know something, and that then allows you tolearn something new. So find an adult that you trust -- a parent, a grandparent or teacher, acoach or a counselor -- and ask them to help you stay on track to meet your goals.And even when you're struggling, even when you're discouraged, and you feel like otherpeople have given up on you, don't ever give up on yourself, because when you give up onyourself, you give up on your country.The story of America isn't about people who quit when things got tough. It's about people whokept going, who tried harder, who loved their country too much to do anything less than theirbest.It's the story of students who sat where you sit 250 years ago, and went on to wage arevolution and they founded this nation. Young people. Students who sat where you sit 75years ago who overcame a Depression and won a world war; who fought for civil rights andput a man on the moon. Students who sat where you sit 20 years ago who founded Googleand Twitter and Facebook and changed the way we communicate with each other.So today, I want to ask all of you, what's your contribution going to be? What problems areyou going to solve? What discoveries will you make? What will a President who comes here in20 or 50 or 100 years say about what all of you did for this country?Now, your families, your teachers, and I are doing everything we can to make sure you havethe education you need to answer these questions. I'm working hard to fix up your classroomsand get you the books and the equipment and the computers you need to learn. But you'vegot to do your part, too. So I expect all of you to get serious this year. I expect you to putyour best effort into everything you do. I expect great things from each of you. So don't let usdown. Don't let your family down or your country down. Most of all, don't let yourself down.Make us all proud.Thank you very much, everybody.God bless you. God bless America.Thank you.",obama
"To Chip, Kathy, and Nancy, who graciously shared your father with a nation that loved him; toWalter's friends, colleagues, protgs, and all who considered him a hero; to the men of theIntrepid; to all of you who are gathered here today; I am honored to be here to pay tribute tothe life and times of the man who chronicled our time.I did not know Mr. Cronkite personally.  And my regret is made more acute by the stories thathave been shared here today. Nor, for that matter, did I know him any better than the tens ofmillions who turned to him each night in search of the answer to a simple question:  ""Whathappened today?""  But like them and like all of you, I have benefited as a citizen from hisdogged pursuit of the truth, his passionate defense of objective reporting, and his view thatjournalism is more than just a profession; it is a public good vital to our democracy.Even in his early career, Walter Cronkite resisted the temptation to get the story first in favorof getting it right.  He wanted to get it first, but he understood the importance of getting itright.  During one of his first jobs in Kansas City, Walter's program manager urged him to goon the air reporting a massive blaze -- and we just heard how much he loved fires -- amassive blaze at city hall that had already claimed lives.  When Walter reached for thetelephone, his boss asked, ""What are you doing; get on the air!""  Walter replied that he wascalling the fire department to confirm the story.  ""You don't need to confirm it,"" the managershouted, ""My wife is watching the whole thing!""Needless to say, Walter made the call, and even as the program manager took to the airhimself to broadcast the unfolding tragedy, Walter discovered that it had been nothing morethan a small fire that hadn't resulted in any injuries.  He lost his job -- but he got the storyright.Walter wasn't afraid to rattle the high and the mighty, either; but he never dared tocompromise his integrity.  He got along with elected officials, even if they were wary of oneanother's motives.  One politician once remarked, ""Walter, my friend, you've got to believeme, fully 85 percent of everything I told you today is the absolute truth.""He shared a complicated relationship with Presidents of both parties, who wanted him on theirside even as they were convinced that he wasn't.  President Johnson called Walter after theevening news from time to time to voice his displeasure over a certain story.  But Walter knewthat if he was receiving vociferous complaints from both sides, he must be doing his job.His endless inquisitiveness about our world, I can imagine, came from a mother who soldencyclopedias for a living.  As a boy, Walter spent countless hours getting lost within theirpages, endlessly sidetracked by new and interesting entries that branched off from oneanother, fascinated by the world around us and how it worked.And that's the way he lived his life -- with curiosity, exploring our planet, seeking to makesense of it and explaining it to others.  He went everywhere and he did everything.  He racedcars and boats; he traveled everywhere from the Amazon to the Arctic; he plunged 8,000 feetbelow the sea, trekked 18,000 feet up into the Himalayas, and experienced weightlessness inthe upper reaches of our atmosphere -- all with one mission:  to make it come alive for therest of us.And as our world began to change, he helped us understand those changes.  He was foreverthere, reporting through world war and cold war; marches and milestones; scandal andsuccess; calmly and authoritatively telling us what we needed to know.  He was a voice ofcertainty in a world that was growing more and more uncertain.  And through it all, he neverlost the integrity or the plainspoken speaking style that he gained growing up in theheartland.  He was a familiar and welcome voice that spoke to each and every one of uspersonally.So it may have seemed inevitable that he was named the most trusted man in America.  Buthere's the thing:  That title wasn't bestowed on him by a network.  We weren't told to believeit by some advertising campaign.  It was earned.  It was earned by year after year anddecade after decade of painstaking effort; a commitment to fundamental values; his beliefthat the American people were hungry for the truth, unvarnished and unaccompanied bytheatre or spectacle.  He didn't believe in dumbing down.  He trusted us.When he was told of this extraordinary honor that he was the most trusted man in America,he naturally downplayed it by saying the people had not polled his wife.  When people of bothpolitical parties actually tried to recruit him to run for office, without even asking for hisstances on the issues, he said no -- to the relief of all potential opponents.  And when, even adecade and a half after his retirement, he still ranked first in seven of eight categories fortelevision journalists, he was disbelieving that he hadn't won the eighth category,""attractiveness.""Through all the events that came to define the 20th century, through all our moments ofdeepest hurt and brightest hope, Walter Cronkite was there, telling the story of the Americanage.And this is how we remember him today.  But we also remember and celebrate the journalismthat Walter practiced -- a standard of honesty and integrity and responsibility to which somany of you have committed your careers.  It's a standard that's a little bit harder to findtoday.  We know that this is a difficult time for journalism.  Even as appetites for news andinformation grow, newsrooms are closing.  Despite the big stories of our era, seriousjournalists find themselves all too often without a beat. Just as the news cycle has shrunk, sohas the bottom line.And too often, we fill that void with instant commentary and celebrity gossip and the softerstories that Walter disdained, rather than the hard news and investigative journalism hechampioned.  ""What happened today?"" is replaced with ""Who won today?""  The public debatecheapens.  The public trust falters.  We fail to understand our world or one another as well aswe should - and that has real consequences in our own lives and in the life of our nation.  Weseem stuck with a choice between what cuts to our bottom line and what harms us as asociety.  Which price is higher to pay?  Which cost is harder to bear?""This democracy,"" Walter said, ""cannot function without a reasonably well-informedelectorate.""  That's why the honest, objective, meticulous reporting that so many of youpursue with the same zeal that Walter did is so vital to our democracy and our society:  Ourfuture depends on it. Walter was no naive idealist.  He understood the challenges and the pressures and thetemptations facing journalism in this new era.  He believed that a media company has anobligation to pursue a profit, but also an obligation to invest a good chunk of that profit backinto news and public affairs.  He was excited about all the stories that a high-tech world ofjournalism would be able to tell, and all the newly-emerging means with which to tell it.Naturally, we find ourselves wondering how he would have covered the monumental stories ofour time.  In an era where the news that city hall is on fire can sweep around the world at thespeed of the Internet, would he still have called to double-check?Would he have been able to cut through the murky noise of the blogs and the tweets and thesound bites to shine the bright light on substance?  Would he still offer the perspective thatwe value?  Would he have been able to remain a singular figure in an age of dwindlingattention spans and omnipresent media?And somehow, we know that the answer is yes.  The simple values Walter Cronkite set out inpursuit of -- to seek the truth, to keep us honest, to explore our world the best he could --they are as vital today as they ever were.Our American story continues.  It needs to be told.  And if we choose to live up to Walter'sexample, if we realize that the kind of journalism he embodied will not simply rekindle itself aspart of a natural cycle, but will come alive only if we stand up and demand it and resolve tovalue it once again, then I'm convinced that the choice between profit and progress is a falseone -- and that the golden days of journalism still lie ahead.Walter Cronkite invited a nation to believe in him -- and he never betrayed that trust.  That'swhy so many of you entered the profession in the first place.  That's why the standards he setfor journalists still stand.  And that's why he loved and valued all of you, but we loved andvalued Walter not only as the rarest of men, but as an indispensable pillar of our society.He's reunited with his beloved Betsy now, watching the stories of this century unfold withboundless optimism -- every so often punctuating the air with a gleeful ""Oh, boy!""  We aregrateful to him for altering and illuminating our time, and for the opportunity he gave to us tosay that, yes, we, too, were there.Thank you very much.",obama

"Eight Septembers have come and gone. Nearly 3,000 days have passed -- almost one for each of thosetaken from us. But no turning of the seasons can diminish the pain and the loss of that day. No passage oftime and no dark skies can ever dull the meaning of this moment. So on this solemn day, at this sacred hour, once more we pause. Once more we pray -- as a nation and asa people; in city streets where our two towers were turned to ashes and dust; in a quiet field where a planefell from the sky; and here, where a single stone of this building is still blackened by the fires. We remember with reverence the lives we lost. We read their names. We press their photos to our hearts.And on this day that marks their death, we recall the beauty and meaning of their lives; men and women andchildren of every color and every creed, from across our nation and from more than 100 others. They wereinnocent. Harming no one, they went about their daily lives. Gone in a horrible instant, they now ""dwell in theHouse of the Lord forever.""We honor all those who gave their lives so that others might live, and all the survivors who battled burns andwounds and helped each other rebuild their lives; men and women who gave life to that most simple ofrules: I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper.We pay tribute to the service of a new generation -- young Americans raised in a time of peace and plentywho saw their nation in its hour of need and said, ""I choose to serve""; ""I will do my part."" And once more wegrieve. For you and your families, no words can ease the ache of your heart. No deeds can fill the emptyplaces in your homes. But on this day and all that follow, you may find solace in the memory of those youloved, and know that you have the unending support of the American people.Scripture teaches us a hard truth. The mountains may fall and the earth may give way; the flesh and theheart may fail. But after all our suffering, God and grace will ""restore you and make you strong, firm andsteadfast."" So it is -- so it has been for these families. So it must be for our nation.Let us renew our resolve against those who perpetrated this barbaric act and who plot against us still. Indefense of our nation we will never waver; in pursuit of al Qaeda and its extremist allies, we will never falter. Let us renew our commitment to all those who serve in our defense -- our courageous men and women inuniform and their families and all those who protect us here at home. Mindful that the work of protectingAmerica is never finished, we will do everything in our power to keep America safe.Let us renew the true spirit of that day. Not the human capacity for evil, but the human capacity for good.Not the desire to destroy, but the impulse to save, and to serve, and to build. On this first National Day ofService and Remembrance, we can summon once more that ordinary goodness of America -- to serve ourcommunities, to strengthen our country, and to better our world. Most of all, on a day when others sought to sap our confidence, let us renew our common purpose. Let usremember how we came together as one nation, as one people, as Americans, united not only in our grief,but in our resolve to stand with one another, to stand up for the country we all love. This may be the greatest lesson of this day, the strongest rebuke to those who attacked us, the highesttribute to those taken from us -- that such sense of purpose need not be a fleeting moment. It can be alasting virtue.For through their own lives -- and through you, the loved ones that they left behind -- the men and womenwho lost their lives eight years ago today leave a legacy that still shines brightly in the darkness, and thatcalls on all of us to be strong and firm and united. That is our calling today and in all the Septembers still tocome.May God bless you and comfort you. And may God bless the United States of America.",obama

"To the Fort Hood community; to Admiral Mullen; General Casey; General Cone; SecretaryMcHugh; Secretary Gates; most importantly, to family, friends, and members of our ArmedForces: We come together filled with sorrow for the 13 Americans that we have lost, withgratitude for the lives that they led, and with a determination to honor them through the workwe carry on.This is a time of war. Yet these Americans did not die on a foreign field of battle. They werekilled here, on American soil, in the heart of this great state and the heart of this greatAmerican community. This is the fact that makes the tragedy even more painful, even moreincomprehensible.For those families who have lost a loved one, no words can fill the void that's been left. Weknew these men and women as soldiers and caregivers. You knew them as mothers andfathers, sons and daughters, sisters and brothers.But here is what you must also know: Your loved ones endure through the life of our nation. Their memory will be honored in the places they lived and by the people they touched. Theirlife's work is our security, and the freedom that we all too often take for granted. Everyevening that the sun sets on a tranquil town; every dawn that a flag is unfurled; everymoment that an American enjoys life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness -- that is theirlegacy. Neither this country, nor the values upon which we were founded, could exist without menand women like these 13 Americans. And that is why we must pay tribute to their stories.Chief Warrant Officer Michael Cahill had served in the National Guard and worked as aphysician's assistant for decades. A husband and father of three, he was so committed to hispatients that on the day he died he was back at work just weeks after having had a heartattack.Major Libardo Eduardo Caraveo spoke little English when he came to America as ateenager. But he put himself through college, earned a Ph.D., and was helping combat unitscope with the stress of deployment. He's survived by his wife, sons, and step-daughters.    Staff Sergeant Justin DeCrow joined the Army right after high school, married his high schoolsweetheart, and had served as a light wheeled mechanic and satellite communicationsoperator. He was known as an optimist, a mentor, and a loving husband and loving father.After retiring from the Army as a major, John Gaffaney cared for society's most vulnerableduring two decades as a psychiatric nurse. He spent three years trying to return to active dutyin this time of war, and he was preparing to deploy to Iraq as a captain. He leaves behind awife and son.Specialist Frederick Greene was a Tennessean who wanted to join the Army for a long time,and did so in 2008, with the support of his family. As a combat engineer he was a naturalleader, and he is survived by his wife and two daughters.Specialist Jason Hunt was also recently married, with three children to care for. He joined theArmy after high school.  He did a tour in Iraq, and it was there that he reenlisted for six moreyears on his 21st birthday so that he could continue to serve.Staff Sergeant Amy Krueger was an athlete in high school, joined the Army shortly after 9/11,and had since returned home to speak to students about her experience.  When her mothertold her she couldn't take on Osama bin Laden by herself, Amy replied: ""Watch me.""Private First Class Aaron Nemelka was an Eagle Scout who just recently signed up to do one ofthe most dangerous jobs in the service -- diffuse bombs -- so that he could help save lives. Hewas proudly carrying on a tradition of military service that runs deep within his family. Private First Class Michael Pearson loved his family and loved his music, and his goal was tobe a music teacher. He excelled at playing the guitar, and could create songs on the spot andshow others how to play. He joined the military a year ago, and was preparing for his firstdeployment.Captain Russell Seager worked as a nurse for the VA, helping veterans with Post-TraumaticStress. He had extraordinary respect for the military, and signed up to serve so that he couldhelp soldiers cope with the stress of combat and return to civilian life. He leaves behind a wifeand son.Private Francheska Velez, daughter of a father from Colombia and a Puerto Rican mother, hadrecently served in Korea and in Iraq, and was pursuing a career in the Army. When she waskilled she was pregnant with her first child, and was excited about becoming a mother.Lieutenant Colonel Juanita Warman was the daughter and granddaughter of Armyveterans. She was a single mom who put herself through college and graduate school, andserved as a nurse practitioner while raising her two daughters. She also left behind a lovinghusband.Private First Class Kham Xiong came to America from Thailand as a small child. He was ahusband and father who followed his brother into the military because his family had a stronghistory of service. He was preparing for his first deployment to Afghanistan.These men and women came from all parts of the country. Some had long careers in themilitary. Some had signed up to serve in the shadow of 9/11. Some had known intensecombat in Iraq and Afghanistan, and some cared for those did. Their lives speak to thestrength, the dignity, the decency of those who serve, and that's how they will beremembered.For that same spirit is embodied in the community here at Fort Hood, and in the manywounded who are still recovering. As was already mentioned, in those terrible minutes duringthe attack, soldiers made makeshift tourniquets out of their clothes. They braved gunfire toreach the wounded, and ferried them back to safety in the backs of cars and a pickup truck.One young soldier, Amber Bahr, was so intent on helping others, she did not realize for sometime that she, herself, had been shot in the back. Two police officers -- Mark Todd and KimMunley -- saved countless lives by risking their own. One medic -- Francisco de la Serna --treated both Officer Munley and the gunman who shot her.It may be hard to comprehend the twisted logic that led to this tragedy. But this much we doknow: No faith justifies these murderous and craven acts. No just and loving God looks uponthem with favor. For what he has done, we know that the killer will be met with justice -- inthis world, and the next.These are trying times for our country. In Afghanistan and Pakistan, the same extremists whokilled nearly 3,000 Americans continue to endanger America, our allies, and innocent Afghansand Pakistanis.In Iraq, we're working to bring a war to a successful end, as there are still those who woulddeny the Iraqi people the future that Americans and Iraqis have sacrificed so much for.As we face these challenges, the stories of those at Fort Hood reaffirm the core values that weare fighting for, and the strength that we must draw upon. Theirs are the tales of Americanmen and women answering an extraordinary call -- the call to serve their comrades, theircommunities, and their country. In an age of self -- selfishness, they embody responsibility. Inan era of division, they call upon us to come together. In a time of cynicism, they remind usof who we are as Americans.We are a nation that endures because of the courage of those who defend it. We saw thatvalor in those who braved bullets here at Fort Hood, just as surely as we see it in those whosigned up knowing they would serve in harms way.We are a nation of laws whose commitment to justice is so enduring that we would treat agunman and give him due process, just as surely as we will see that he pays for his crimes.We're a nation that guarantees the freedom to worship as one chooses. And instead ofclaiming God for our side, we remember Lincolns words, and always pray to be on the side ofGod.We're a nation that is dedicated to the proposition that all men and women are created equal. We live that truth within our military, and see it in the varied backgrounds of those we lay torest today. We defend that truth at home and abroad, and we know that Americans willalways be found on the side of liberty and equality. That's who we are as a people.Tomorrow is Veterans Day. It's a chance to pause, and to pay tribute -- for students to learnthe struggles that preceded them; for families to honor the service of parents andgrandparents; for citizens to reflect upon the sacrifices that have been made in pursuit of amore perfect union.For history is filled with heroes. You may remember the stories of a grandfather who marchedacross Europe; an uncle who fought in Vietnam; a sister who served in the Gulf. But as wehonor the many generations who have served, all of us -- every single American -- mustacknowledge that this generation has more than proved itself the equal of those who've comebefore. We need not look to the past for greatness, because it is before our very eyes.This generation of soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen have volunteeredin the time of certain danger. They are part of the finest fighting force that the world has everknown. They have served tour after tour of duty in distant, different, and difficult places. Theyhave stood watch in blinding deserts and on snowy mountains.They have extended the opportunity of self-government to peoples that have suffered tyrannyand war. They are men and women -- white, black, and brown -- of all faiths and all stations -- all Americans, serving together to protect our people, while giving others half a world awaythe chance to lead a better life.In todays wars, there's not always a simple ceremony that signals our troops success -- nosurrender papers to be signed, or capital to be claimed. But the measure of the impact ofthese young men and women is no less great. In a world of threats that no know borders,their legacy will be marked in the safety of our cities and towns, and the security andopportunity that's extended abroad. It will serve as testimony to the character of those whoserved, and the example that all of you in uniform set for America and for the world.Here at Fort Hood, we pay tribute to 13 men and women who were not able to escape thehorror of war, even in the comfort of home. Later today at Fort Lewis, one community willgather to remember so many in one Stryker Brigade who have fallen in Afghanistan.Long after they are laid to rest -- when the fighting has finished, and our nation has endured;when todays servicemen and women are veterans and their children have grown -- it will besaid that this generation believed under the most trying of tests; believed in perseverance --not just when it was easy, but when it was hard; that they paid the price and bore the burdento secure this nation, and stood up for the values that live in the hearts of all free peoples.So we say goodbye to those who now belong to eternity.We press ahead in pursuit of the peace that guided their service.May God bless the memory of those that we have lost.And may God bless the United States of America.",obama
"To the United States Corps of Cadets, to the men and women of our armed services, and tomy fellow Americans: I want to speak to you tonight about our effort in Afghanistan -- thenature of our commitment there, the scope of our interests, and the strategy that myAdministration will pursue to bring this war to a successful conclusion. It's an extraordinaryhonor for me to do so here at West Point, where so many men and women have prepared tostand up for our security, and to represent what is finest about our country. To address these important issues, it's important to recall why America and our allies werecompelled to fight a war in Afghanistan in the first place. We did not ask for this fight. OnSeptember 11th, 2001, 19 men hijacked four airplanes and used them to murder nearly 3,000people. They struck at our military and economic nerve centers. They took the lives ofinnocent men, women, and children without regard to their faith or race or station. Were it notfor the heroic actions of passengers on board one of these flights, they could have also struckat one of the great symbols of our democracy in Washington, and killed many more.As we know, these men belonged to al Qaeda -- a group of extremists who have distorted anddefiled Islam, one of the world's great religions, to justify the slaughter of innocents. AlQaeda's base of operations was in Afghanistan, where they were harbored by the Taliban -- aruthless, repressive, and radical movement that seized control of that country after it wasravaged by years of Soviet occupation and civil war, and after the attention of America andour friends had turned elsewhere.Just days after 9/11, Congress authorized the use of force against al Qaeda and those whoharbored them -- an authorization that continues to this day. The vote in the Senate was 98to 0. The vote in the House was 420 to 1. For the first time in its history, the North AtlanticTreaty Organization invoked Article 5 -- the commitment that says an attack on one membernation is an attack on all. And the United Nations Security Council endorsed the use of allnecessary steps to respond to the 9/11 attacks. America, our allies, and the world were actingas one to destroy al Qaeda's terrorist network, and to protect our common security.Under the banner of this domestic unity and international legitimacy -- and only after theTaliban refused to turn over Osama bin Laden -- we sent our troops into Afghanistan. Within amatter of months, al Qaeda was scattered and many of its operatives were killed. The Talibanwas driven from power and pushed back on its heels. A place that had known decades of fearnow had reason to hope. At a conference convened by the UN, a provisional government wasestablished under President Hamid Karzai. And an International Security Assistance Force wasestablished to help bring a lasting peace to a war-torn country.Then, in early 2003, the decision was made to wage a second war in Iraq. The wrenchingdebate over the Iraq War is well-known and need not be repeated here. It's enough to saythat for the next six years, the Iraq War drew the dominant share of our troops, ourresources, our diplomacy, and our national attention -- and that the decision to go into Iraqcaused substantial rifts between America and much of the world.Today, after extraordinary costs, we are bringing the Iraq war to an responsible end. We willremove our combat brigades from Iraq by the end of next summer, and all of our troops bythe end of 2011. That we are doing so is a testament to the character of the men and womenin uniform. Thanks to their courage, grit, and perseverance, we have given Iraqis a chance toshape their future, and we are successfully leaving Iraq to its people.But while we have achieved hard-earned milestones in Iraq, the situation in Afghanistan hasdeteriorated. After escaping across the border into Pakistan in 2001 and 2002, al Qaeda'sleadership established a safe-haven there. Although a legitimate government was elected bythe Afghan people, it's been hampered by corruption, the drug trade, an under-developedeconomy, and insufficient security forces. Over the last several years, the Taliban hasmaintained common cause with al Qaeda, as they both seek an overthrow of the Afghangovernment. Gradually, the Taliban has begun to control additional swaths of territory inAfghanistan, while engaging in increasingly brazen and devastating attacks of terrorismagainst the Pakistani people.Now throughout this period, our troop levels in Afghanistan remained a fraction of what theywere in Iraq. When I took office, we had just over 32,000 Americans serving in Afghanistan,compared to 160,000 in Iraq at the peak of the war. Commanders in Afghanistan repeatedlyasked for support to deal with the reemergence of the Taliban, but these reinforcements didnot arrive.And that's why, shortly after taking office, I approved a long-standing request for moretroops. After consultations with our allies, I then announced a strategy recognizing thefundamental connection between our war effort in Afghanistan and the extremist safe-havensin Pakistan. I set a goal that was narrowly defined as disrupting, dismantling, and defeating alQaeda and its extremist allies, and pledged to better coordinate our military and civilian effort.Since then, we have made progress on some important objectives. High-ranking al Qaeda andTaliban leaders have been killed, and we've stepped up the pressure on al Qaeda world-wide.In Pakistan, that nation's Army has gone on its largest offensive in years. In Afghanistan, weand our allies prevented the Taliban from stopping a presidential election, and although it wasmarred by fraud, that election produced a government that is consistent with Afghanistan'slaws and Constitution.Yet huge challenges remain. Afghanistan is not lost, but for several years it has movedbackwards. There's no imminent threat of the government being overthrown, but the Talibanhas gained momentum. Al Qaeda has not reemerged in Afghanistan in the same numbers asbefore 9/11, but they retain their safe-havens along the border. And our forces lack the fullsupport they need to effectively train and partner with Afghan security forces and bettersecure the population. Our new Commander in Afghanistan, General McChrystal, has reportedthat the security situation is more serious than he anticipated. In short, the status quo is notsustainable.As cadets, you volunteered for service during this time of danger. Some of you fought inAfghanistan. Some of you will deploy there. As your Commander-in-Chief, I owe you a missionthat is clearly defined and worthy of your service. And that's why, after the Afghan voting wascompleted, I insisted on a thorough review of our strategy. Now let me be clear: There hasnever been an option before me that called for troop deployments before 2010. So there hasbeen no delay or denial of resources necessary for the conduct of the war during this reviewperiod. Instead, the review has allowed me ask the hard questions, and to explore all of thedifferent options along with my national security team, our military and civilian leadership inAfghanistan, and our key partners. Now given the stakes involved, I owed the Americanpeople, and our troops, no less.This review is now complete. And as Commander-in-Chief, I have determined that it is in ourvital national interest to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan. After 18months, our troops will begin to come home. These are the resources that we need to seizethe initiative, while building the Afghan capacity that can allow for a responsible transition ofour forces out of Afghanistan.I do not make this decision lightly. I opposed the war in Iraq precisely because I believe thatwe must exercise restraint in the use of military force, and always consider the long-termconsequences of our actions. We have been at war now for eight years, at enormous cost inlives and resources. Years of debate over Iraq and terrorism have left our unity on nationalsecurity issues in tatters and created a highly polarized and partisan backdrop for this effort.And having just experienced the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, theAmerican people are understandably focused on rebuilding our economy and putting people towork here at home.And most of all, I know that this decision asks even more of you -- a military that, along withyour families, has already borne the heaviest of all burdens. As President, I have signed aletter of condolence to the family of each American who gives their life in these wars. I haveread the letters from the parents and spouses of those who deployed. I've visited ourcourageous wounded warriors at Walter Reed. I've travelled to Dover to meet the flag-drapedcaskets of 18 Americans returning home to their final resting place. I see firsthand the terriblewages of war. If I did not think that the security of the United States and the safety of theAmerican people were at stake in Afghanistan, I would gladly order every single one of ourtroops home tomorrow.So no, I do not make this decision lightly. I make this decision because I am convinced thatour security is at stake in Afghanistan and Pakistan. This is the epicenter of violent extremismpracticed by al Qaeda. It is from here that we were attacked on 9/11, and it is from here thatnew attacks are being plotted as I speak. This is no idle danger, no hypothetical threat. In thelast few months alone, we have apprehended extremists within our borders who were senthere from the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan to commit new acts of terror. Andthis danger will only grow if the region slides backwards, and al Qaeda can operate withimpunity. We must keep the pressure on al Qaeda, and to do that we must increase thestability and capacity of our partners in the region.Of course this burden is not ours alone to bear. This is not just America's war. Since 9/11, alQaeda's safe-havens have been the source of attacks against London and Amman and Bali.The people and governments of both Afghanistan and Pakistan are endangered. And thestakes are even higher within a nuclear-armed Pakistan, because we know that al Qaeda andother extremists seek nuclear weapons, and we have every reason to believe that they woulduse them.These facts compel us to act along with our friends and allies. Our overarching goal remainsthe same: to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and toprevent its capacity to threaten America and our allies in the future.To meet that goal, we will pursue the following objectives within Afghanistan. We must denyal Qaeda a safe-haven. We must reverse the Taliban's momentum and deny it the ability tooverthrow the government. And we must strengthen the capacity of Afghanistan's securityforces and government, so that they can take lead responsibility for Afghanistan's future.We will meet these objectives in three ways. First, we will pursue a military strategy that willbreak the Taliban's momentum and increase Afghanistan's capacity over the next 18 months.The 30,000 additional troops that I'm announcing tonight will deploy in the first part of 2010 -- the fastest possible pace -- so that they can target the insurgency and secure key populationcenters. They'll increase our ability to train competent Afghan security forces, and to partnerwith them so that more Afghans can get into the fight. And they will help create the conditionsfor the United States to transfer responsibility to the Afghans.Because this is an international effort, I've asked that our commitment be joined bycontributions from our allies. Some have already provided additional troops, and we'reconfident that there will be further contributions in the days and weeks ahead. Our friendshave fought and bled and died alongside us in Afghanistan. And now we must come togetherto end this war successfully. For what's at stake is not simply a test of NATO's credibility;what's at stake is the security of our allies, and the common security of the world.Now taken together, these additional American and international troops will allow us toaccelerate handing over responsibility to Afghan forces, and allow us to begin the transfer ofour forces out of Afghanistan in July of 2011. Just as we have done in Iraq, we will executethis transition responsibly, taking into account conditions on the ground. We'll continue toadvise and assist Afghanistan's security forces to ensure that they can succeed over the longhaul. But it will be clear to the Afghan government -- and more importantly, to the Afghanpeople -- that they will ultimately be responsible for their own country.Second, we will work with our partners, the United Nations, and the Afghan people to pursuea more effective civilian strategy, so that the government can take advantage of improvedsecurity.This effort must be based on performance. The days of providing a blank check are over.President Karzai's inauguration speech sent the right message about moving in a newdirection. And going forward, we will be clear about what we expect from those who receiveour assistance. We'll support Afghan Ministries, governors, and local leaders that combatcorruption and deliver for the people. We expect those who are ineffective or corrupt to beheld accountable. And we will also focus our assistance in areas, such as agriculture, that canmake an immediate impact in the lives of the Afghan people.The people of Afghanistan have endured violence for decades. They've been confronted withoccupation by the Soviet Union, and then by foreign al Qaeda fighters who used Afghan landfor their own purposes. So tonight, I want the Afghan people to understand: America seeks anend to this era of war and suffering. We have no interest in occupying your country. We willsupport efforts by the Afghan government to open the door to those Taliban who abandonviolence and respect the human rights of their fellow citizens.And we will seek a partnership with Afghanistan grounded in mutual respect -- to isolate thosewho destroy, to strengthen those who build, to hasten the day when our troops will leave, andto forge a lasting friendship in which America is your partner, and never your patron.Third, we will act with the full recognition that our success in Afghanistan is inextricably linkedto our partnership with Pakistan.We're in Afghanistan to prevent a cancer from once again spreading through that country. Butthis same cancer has also taken root in the border region of Pakistan. And that's why we needa strategy that works on both sides of the border.In the past, there have been those in Pakistan who have argued that the struggle againstextremism is not their fight, and that Pakistan is better off doing little or seekingaccommodation with those who use violence. But in recent years, as innocents have beenkilled from Karachi to Islamabad, it has become clear that it is the Pakistani people who arethe most endangered by extremism. Public opinion has turned. The Pakistani Army has wagedan offensive in Swat and South Waziristan. And there is no doubt that the United States andPakistan share a common enemy.In the past, we too often defined our relationship with Pakistan narrowly. And those days areover. Moving forward, we are committed to a partnership with Pakistan that is built on afoundation of mutual interests, mutual respect, and mutual trust. We will strengthenPakistan's capacity to target those groups that threaten our countries, and have made it clearthat we cannot tolerate a safe-haven for terrorists whose location is known, and whoseintentions are clear. America is also providing substantial resources to support Pakistan'sdemocracy and development. We are the largest international supporter for those Pakistanisdisplaced by the fighting. And going forward, the Pakistani people must know: America willremain a strong supporter of Pakistan's security and prosperity long after the guns have fallensilent, so that the great potential of its people can be unleashed.These are the three core elements of our strategy: a military effort to create the conditions fora transition; a civilian surge that reinforces positive action; and an effective partnership withPakistan.I recognize that there are a range of concerns about our approach. So let me briefly address afew of the prominent arguments that I have heard, and which I take very seriously.First, there are those who suggest that Afghanistan is another Vietnam. They argue that itcannot be stabilized, and we're better off cutting our losses and rapidly withdrawing. I believethis argument depends upon a false reading of history. Unlike Vietnam, we are joined by abroad coalition of 43 nations that recognizes the legitimacy of our action. Unlike Vietnam, weare not facing a broad-based popular insurgency.And most importantly, unlike Vietnam, the American people were viciously attacked fromAfghanistan, and remain a target for those same extremists who are plotting along its border.To abandon this area now, and to rely only on efforts against al Qaeda from a distance, wouldsignificantly hamper our ability to keep the pressure on al Qaeda, and create an unacceptablerisk of additional attacks on our homeland and our allies.Second, there are those who acknowledge that we can't leave Afghanistan in its current state,but suggest that we go forward with the troops that we already have. But this would simplymaintain a status quo in which we muddle through, and permit a slow deterioration ofconditions there. It would ultimately prove more costly and prolong our stay in Afghanistan,because we would never be able to generate the conditions needed to train Afghan securityforces and give them the space to take over.Finally, there are those who oppose identifying a timeframe for our transition to Afghanresponsibility. Indeed, some call for a more dramatic and open-ended escalation of our wareffort -- one that would commit us to a nation building project of up to a decade. I reject thiscourse because it sets goals that are beyond what can be achieved at a reasonable cost, andwhat we need to achieve to secure our interests. Furthermore, the absence of a timeframe fortransition would deny us any sense of urgency in working with the Afghan government. Itmust be clear that Afghans will have to take responsibility for their security, and that Americahas no interest in fighting an endless war in Afghanistan.As President, I refuse to set goals that go beyond our responsibility, our means, or ourinterests. And I must weigh all of the challenges that our nation faces. I don't have the luxuryof committing to just one. Indeed, I'm mindful of the words of President Eisenhower, who -- indiscussing our national security -- said, ""Each proposal must be weighed in the light of abroader consideration: the need to maintain balance in and among national programs.""Over the past several years, we have lost that balance. We've failed to appreciate theconnection between our national security and our economy. In the wake of an economic crisis,too many of our neighbors and friends are out of work and struggle to pay the bills. Too manyAmericans are worried about the future facing our children. Meanwhile, competition within theglobal economy has grown more fierce. So we can't simply afford to ignore the price of thesewars.All told, by the time I took office the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan approached atrillion dollars. Going forward, I am committed to addressing these costs openly and honestly.Our new approach in Afghanistan is likely to cost us roughly 30 billion dollars for the militarythis year, and I'll work closely with Congress to address these costs as we work to bring downour deficit.But as we end the war in Iraq and transition to Afghan responsibility, we must rebuild ourstrength here at home. Our prosperity provides a foundation for our power. It pays for ourmilitary. It underwrites our diplomacy. It taps the potential of our people, and allowsinvestment in new industry. And it will allow us to compete in this century as successfully aswe did in the last. That's why our troop commitment in Afghanistan cannot be open-ended --because the nation that I am most interested in building is our own.Now let me be clear: None of this will be easy. The struggle against violent extremism will notbe finished quickly, and it extends well beyond Afghanistan and Pakistan. It will be anenduring test of our free society and our leadership in the world. And unlike the great powerconflicts and clear lines of division that defined the 20th century, our effort will involvedisorderly regions, failed states, diffuse enemies.So as a result, America will have to show our strength in the way that we end wars andprevent conflict -- not just how we wage wars. We'll have to be nimble and precise in our useof military power. Where al Qaeda and its allies attempt to establish a foothold -- whether inSomalia or Yemen or elsewhere -- they must be confronted by growing pressure and strongpartnerships.And we can't count on military might alone. We have to invest in our homeland security,because we can't capture or kill every violent extremist abroad. We have to improve andbetter coordinate our intelligence, so that we stay one step ahead of shadowy networks.We will have to take away the tools of mass destruction. And that's why I've made it a centralpillar of my foreign policy to secure loose nuclear materials from terrorists, to stop the spreadof nuclear weapons, and to pursue the goal of a world without them, because every nationmust understand that true security will never come from an endless race for ever-moredestructive weapons. True security will come for those who reject them.We will have to use diplomacy, because no one nation can meet the challenges of aninterconnected world acting alone. I've spent this year renewing our alliances and forging newpartnerships. And we have forged a new beginning between America and the Muslim World --one that recognizes our mutual interest in breaking a cycle of conflict, and that promises afuture in which those who kill innocents are isolated by those who stand up for peace andprosperity and human dignity.And finally, we must draw on the strength of our values. For the challenges that we face mayhave changed, but the things that we believe in must not. And that's why we must promoteour values by living them at home -- which is why I have prohibited torture and will close theprison at Guantanamo Bay. And we must make it clear to every man, woman, and childaround the world who lives under the dark cloud of tyranny that America will speak out onbehalf of their human rights, and tend to the light of freedom, and justice, and opportunity,and respect for the dignity of all peoples. That is who we are. That is the source, the moralsource of America's authority.Since the days of Franklin Roosevelt, and the service and sacrifice of our grandparents andgreat grandparents, our country has borne a special burden in global affairs. We have spilledAmerican blood in many countries on multiple continents. We have spent our revenue to helpothers rebuild from rubble and develop their own economies. We have joined with others todevelop an architecture of institutions from the United Nations to NATO to the World Bank thatprovide for the common security and prosperity of human beings.We have not always been thanked for these efforts, and we have at times made mistakes. Butmore than any other nation, the United States of America has underwritten global security forover six decades -- a time that, for all its problems, has seen walls come down, and marketsopen, and billions lifted from poverty, unparalleled scientific progress, and advancing frontiersof human liberty. For unlike the great powers of old, we have not sought world domination. Our union wasfounded in resistance to oppression. We do not seek to occupy other nations. We will notclaim another nation's resources or target other peoples because their faith or ethnicity isdifferent from ours. What we have fought for, and what we continue to fight for, is a betterfuture for our children and grandchildren, and we believe that their lives will be better ifothers [sic] peoples' children and grandchildren can live in freedom and access opportunity.As a country, we're not as young and perhaps not as innocent as we were when Rooseveltwas President. Yet we are still heirs to a noble struggle for freedom. And now we mustsummon all of our might and moral suasion to meet the challenges of a new age.In the end, our security and leadership does not come solely from the strength of our arms. Itderives from our people: from the workers and businesses who will rebuild our economy; fromthe entrepreneurs and researchers who will pioneer new industries; from the teachers that willeducate our children, and the service of those who work in our communities at home; fromthe diplomats and Peace Corps volunteers who spread hope abroad; and from the men andwomen in uniform who are part of an unbroken line of sacrifice that has made government ofthe people, by the people, and for the people a reality on this Earth.2This vast and diverse citizenry will not always agree on every issue -- nor should we. But Ialso know that we, as a country, cannot sustain our leadership nor navigate the momentouschallenges of our time if we allow ourselves to be split asunder by the same rancor andcynicism and partisanship that has in recent times poisoned our national discourse.It's easy to forget that when this war began, we were united -- bound together by the freshmemory of a horrific attack, and by the determination to defend our homeland and the valueswe hold dear. I refuse to accept the notion that we cannot summon that unity again. I believe-- I believe with every fiber of my being that we, as Americans, can still come together behinda common purpose. For our values are not simply words written into parchment. They are acreed that calls us together, and that has carried us through the darkest of storms as onenation, as one people.America, we are passing through a time of great trial. And the message that we send in themidst of these storms must be clear: that our cause is just, our resolve unwavering.

"President Obama:  Thank you.  On behalf of Michelle and myself, welcome to the WhiteHouse.Little Child:  Thank you.President Obama:  Thank you. This a season of joy, tradition and celebration.Little Child:  Yea!President Obama:  Yes!  And today, it is our great joy to continue a White House holidaytradition -- a celebration of performers who have transformed the arts in America, ourextraordinary Kennedy Center Honorees.We are joined by Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- members of Congress and members of the Kennedyfamily.  I see sprinkled through the crowd some pretty fancy company, as well -- you've gotthe Queen of Soul. You've got Martin Scorsese -- he knows a little bit about film-making. Andmy spectacular First Lady is here, as well.I especially want to thank the man who created these Honors more than three decades agoand who has produced them ever since -- and whom I was proud to name as co-chair of thePresident's Committee on the Arts and Humanities -- George Stevens, Jr.  George. And I want to also thank Stephen Schwarzman and the Kennedy Center trustees. As well aspresident Michael Kaiser and all those who sustain President Kennedy's vision of a ""greatstage"" celebrating ""the best coming from this country and abroad.""These performers are indeed the best.  They are also living reminders of a simple truth -- andI'm going to steal a line from Michelle here -- the arts are not somehow apart from ournational life, the arts are at the heart of our national life.In times of war and sacrifice, the arts -- and these artists -- remind us to sing and to laughand to live.  In times of plenty, they challenge our conscience and implore us to remember theleast among us.  In moments of division or doubt, they compel us to see the common valuesthat we share; the ideals to which we aspire, even if we sometimes fall short.  In days ofhardship, they renew our hope that brighter days are still ahead.So let's never forget that art strengthens America.  And that's why we're making sure thatAmerica strengthens its arts.  It's why we're reenergizing the National Endowment of theArts.  That's why we're helping to sustain jobs in arts communities across the country.  It'swhy we're supporting arts education in our schools, and why Michelle and I have hostedstudents here at the White House to experience the best of American poetry and music.   And it's why we're honored to celebrate these five remarkable performers, who for decadeshave helped to sustain and strengthen the American spirit.You can't understand America without understanding jazz.  And you can't understand jazz,without understanding Dave Brubeck.  His mother was a classical pianist with high hopes forher son.  And by the time he was four, he was playing himself.  But by the time he was ateenager, he was tearing up local honky-tonks.  Even his mother had to admit: ""There is somehope for David after all.""And perhaps it was World War II -- his service in Patton's Army -- that changed his sound,forcing him, as he said, to work the war out of his system by playing some ""pretty viciouspiano."" Whatever it was, his sound -- the distinctive harmonies and improvisations of theDave Brubeck Quartet -- would change jazz forever, prompting Time magazine to put him onthe cover as the leader of a new jazz age.Having brought jazz into the mainstream, he then transformed it, with innovative newrhythms on albums like Time Out -- the  first jazz album to ever sell more than a millioncopies and still one of the best-selling jazz albums of all time.Dave Brubeck has never stopped reaching new audiences:  Performing for Presidents fromJohnson to Reagan; composing orchestral tributes to Martin Luther King and Pope John PaulII; and even in his 80s, dazzling jazz festivals across America.And I know personally how powerful his performances can be. I mentioned this to Davebackstage.  In the few weeks that I spent with my father as a child -- he came to visit me forabout a month when I was young -- one of the things he did was to take me to my first jazzconcert, in Honolulu, Hawaii, in 1971, and it was a Dave Brubeck concert.  And I've been ajazz fan ever since.  The world that he opened up for a 10-year-old boy was spectacular. And, Dave, for the joy that you've given millions of jazz lovers like me, for your six decades ofrevolutionary rhythms, you are rightly honored -- especially today, on your 89th birthday.He was born Melvin Kaminsky --Mel Brooks:  He never understood 4/4 time1 -- President Obama:  He's still messing it up, Mel.  Mel, I'm trying to say something nice aboutyou, now.  Please don't upstage me.As you can tell, he was born to entertain. Or, as Mel Brooks explains it:  ""Look at Jewishhistory -- unrelieved lamenting would be intolerable.  So every 10 Jews, God designed one tobe crazy and amuse the others."" According to Mel, ""By the time I was five I knew I was thatone."" And by the time he was nine, this boy from Brooklyn had seen his first musical and dreamedof becoming ""the King of Broadway."" But World War II meant service in the Army -- or, as heput it, ""the European Theater of Operations"" with ""lots of operations"" and ""very little theater."" Returning home, he found success cranking out quips for Sid Ceasar -- or as Mel described hisreaction to success -- ""panic, hysteria, insomniaand years of psychoanalysis.""That's right, we're reading back all your golden moments here, Mel.Unfortunately, many of the punch lines that have defined Mel Brooks' success cannot berepeated here.  I was telling him that I went to see Blazing Saddles -- when I was 10.  And hepointed out that I think, according to the ratings, I should not have been allowed in thetheater. That's true.  I think I had a fake ID. But the statute of limitations has passed.Suffice it to say, in his satires and parodies, no cow is sacred, no genre is safe.  He mockedthe musical -- and Hitler -- in The Producers, the western in Blazing Saddles, and the horrorfilm in Young Frankenstein.But behind all the insanity and absurdity, there's been a method to Mel's madness.  He'sdescribed his work as ""unearthing the truth that is all around us.""  And by illuminatinguncomfortable truths -- about racism and sexism and anti-Semitism -- he's been called ""ourjester, asking us to see ourselves as we really are, determined that we laugh ourselves sane.""For this, he is one of the few people ever to receive an Emmy and a Grammy and an Oscarand a Tony.  Writer, director, actor, producer, composerfor his success -- and for hispsychoanalysis -- we honor Mel Brooks.Reflecting on the challenge of finding one's voice, Grace Bumbry once said:  ""God has alreadyplanted that in your throat. It's your job to free it up, to allow that beautiful thing to shinethrough."" True to her name, Grace allowed her voice to shine through and touch all those within itsrange.  Around her family's piano in St. Louis; on the talent show where, as a teenager, shemoved the host to tears; and then, after being turned away from one music school because ofthe color of her skin -- her triumphant international debut at the Paris Opera, when she wasjust 23 years old.With a pitch and presence like no other, she became a global sensation, moving audiences atthe great opera houses of the world.  And performing here at the White House, it was saidthat she moved Jacqueline Kennedy to lean over and gently sing along the words to thePresident.Defying every expectation, Grace Bumbry then made the transition from mezzo to soprano. And over the decades that followed, she displayed a range like few others -- sometimes themiddle ranges as a mezzo; sometimes the highs of a soprano; sometimes both in the sameperformance.  Grace not only triumphed in different techniques, she transformed them.And though she gave her final operatic performance in 1997, she appears in recitals to thisday.  After nearly 50 years, she remains the definition of a diva in the classical sense:  adivine voice worthy of the heavens.  And tonight -- 32 years after she performed at the firstKennedy Center Honors for her mentor Marian Anderson -- we honor Grace Bumbry.Growing up in New York City's Little Italy, Bobby De Niro always knew what he wanted to be. Coming home from the movies, he'd act out the parts.  At age 10, in his school play, he madea rather unlikely debut in The Wizard of Oz as the Cowardly Lion.He has said:  ""my joy as an actor is to live different lives.""  And in more than 60 filmsspanning more than 40 years, Robert De Niro has lived some of the most iconic and intensecharacters ever portrayed on film.  A dying baseball player in Bang The Drum Slowly.  Ayoung Vito Corleone in The Godfather Part II.  A deranged Taxi Driver.  A troubled veteran inThe Deer Hunter.  A brutal boxer in Raging Bull.  A vengeful ex-con in Cape Fear.  Let's hopethat Martin Scorsese was kidding when he said that Robert is ""full of something that hewanted to express.""  Don't worry, we did a vet on him before he came in tonight.But alongside his Oscar-winning emotional audacity there's his versatility, from a coma patientin Awakenings, to an ever-possessive father in Meet The Parents.  There's his legendarymethod -- not simply portraying characters, but becoming them, emotionally and physically. And there is his love for his city -- whether it's directing films like A Bronx Tale, or foundingthe film center and festival that has energized the arts in New York City.It is perhaps the great irony of his life -- one of America's greatest cinematic actors is a man,famously, of few words off the screen -- and I can attest to this.  So I'll simply say, thank you,Robert De Niro.Finally, we honor the quiet kid from Jersey -- who grew up to become the rock 'n' roll laureateof a generation. For in the life of our country only a handful of people have tapped the fullpower of music to tell the real American story -- with honesty; from the heart; and one ofthose people is Bruce Springsteen. He has said:  ""I've always believed that people listen to your music not to find out about you,but to find out about themselves.""  And for more than three decades, in his songs -- ofdreams and despair, of struggle and hope -- hardworking folks have seen themselves.They've seen their great state of New Jersey.  And they've seen their America -- in songs thatbecome anthems.  Restless kids who were ""Born to Run."" The struggles of workers in ""MyHometown.""  The sacrifices of vets who were ""Born in the U.S.A."" Love and loss in ""Streets ofPhiladelphia.""  A resilient nation in ""The Rising.""  And, this year, a country ""Working on aDream.""It's no wonder that his tours are not so much concerts, but communions.  There's a place foreverybody -- the sense that no matter who you are or what you do, everyone deserves theirshot at the American Dream; everybody deserves a little bit of dignity; everybody deserves tobe heard.I've seen it myself.  Bruce was a great fan -- a great friend over the last year, and when Iwatched him on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial when he rocked the National Mall before myinauguration, I thought it captured as well as anything the spirit of what America should beabout.  On a day like that, and today, I remember:  I'm the President, but he's The Boss.  And Bruce continues to inspire, along with his ""house-rocking, earth-shaking"" E Street Band. At 60 years old, he's still filling stadiums, still whipping fans into a frenzy, still surfing thecrowd, still jumping off pianos, and still reaching new fans, and still being nominated forGrammys.  It's been a long road from that stage at Stone Pony in Asbury Park to this stagetoday, but this much we know -- after more than 30 years and 120 million albums sold, BruceSpringsteen is still one ""cool rockin' Daddy.""Dave Brubeck.  Mel Brooks.  Grace Bumbry.  Robert De Niro.  Bruce Springsteen.  Theirstories are their own.  But the part that they play in the larger American story -- that's whatwe honor here tonight.  What they say is that with respect for the past, we can keep strongthe traditions and values that enrich us all; that with confidence in the present, and inourselves, we can overcome whatever comes our way; and that with faith in the future,America's greatest ""Glory Days"" are still to come.So thank you to all of our honorees.  Thank you all very much for the joy and the beauty thatyou've contributed to our lives.  We are very grateful.  Thank you.",obama
"Thank you so much, Strobe, for your extraordinary leadership here at Brookings, and thanksto all of you in attendance. Almost exactly one year ago, on a frigid winter's day, I met with my new economic team atthe headquarters of my presidential transition offices in Chicago.  And over the course of fourhours, my advisors presented an analysis of where the economy at that time stood,accompanied by a chilling set of charts and graphs, predicting where we might end up.  It wasan unforgettable series of presentations.Christy Romer -- who's here today -- tapped to head the Council of Economic Advisers, as wellas Larry Summers, who I'd chosen to head the National Economic Council, described animminent downturn comparable in its severity to almost nothing since the 1930s.  TimGeithner, my incoming Treasury Secretary, reported that the financial system, shaken by thesubprime crisis, had halted almost all lending, which in turn threatened to pull the broadereconomy in a downward spiral.  Peter Orszag, my incoming Budget Director, closed out theproceedings with an entirely dismal report on the fiscal health of the country, with growingdeficits and debt stretching to the horizon.  Having concluded that it was too late for me torequest a recount -- I tasked my team with mapping out a plan to tackle the crisis on allfronts. It wasn't long after that meeting, as we shaped this economic plan, that we began to seesome of these forecasts materialize.  Over the previous year, it was obvious that folks werefacing hard times.  As I traveled across the country during the long campaign, I would meetmen and women bearing the brunt of not only a deepening recession, but also years -- evendecades -- of growing strains on middle class families.  But now the country was experiencingsomething far worse.  Our gross domestic product -- the sum total of all that our economyproduces  -- fell at the fastest rate in a quarter century.  Five trillion dollars of Americans'household wealth evaporated in just 12 weeks as stocks, pensions, and home valuesplummeted.  We were losing an average of 700,000 jobs each month, equivalent to thepopulation of the state of Vermont.  That was true in December, January, February, March. The fear among economists across the political spectrum that was -- was that we were rapidlyplummeting towards a second Great Depression.So, in the weeks and months that followed, we undertook a series of difficult steps to preventthat outcome.  And we were forced to take those steps largely without the help of anopposition party, which, unfortunately, after having presided over the decision-making thathad led to the crisis, decided to hand it over to others to solve.We acted to get lending flowing again so businesses could get loans to buy equipment, andordinary Americans could get financing to buy homes and cars, to go to college, and to startor run businesses.  We enacted measures to stem the tide of foreclosures in our housingmarket, helping responsible homeowners stay in their homes and helping to stop the broaderdecline in home values which was eating away at what tends to be a family's largest asset. To achieve this, and to prevent economic collapse, we were forced to extend assistance tosome of the very banks and financial institutions whose actions had helped precipitate theturmoil.  We also took steps to prevent the rapid dissolution of the American auto industry --which faced a crisis partly of its own making -- to prevent the loss of hundreds of thousandsof jobs during an already fragile, shaky time.  These were not decisions that were popular orsatisfying; these were decisions that were necessary.Now, even as we worked to address the crises in our banking sector, in our housing market,and in our auto industry, we also began attacking our economic crisis on a broader front.  Lessthan one month after taking office we enacted the most sweeping economic recovery packagein history:  the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The Recovery Act was divided into three parts.  One-third went for tax relief for smallbusinesses and 95 percent of working families.  Another third was for emergency relief to helpfolks who've borne the brunt of this recession.  We extended or increased unemploymentbenefits for more than 17 million Americans; made health insurance 65 percent cheaper forfamilies relying on COBRA. And for state and local governments facing historic budgetshortfalls as demand for services went up and revenues went down, we provided assistancethat has saved the jobs of hundreds of thousands of teachers and public school workers,firefighters and police officers.The last third of the Recovery Act is for investments to put Americans to work doing the workthat America needs done:  doubling our capacity in renewable energy like wind and solar;computerizing medical records to save money and lives; providing the largest boost tomedical research in history; renovating classrooms and school laboratories; and upgradingroads and railways as part of the largest investment in infrastructure since the creation of theInterstate Highway System half a century ago.And even as the Recovery Act has created jobs and spurred growth, we have not let up in ourefforts to take every responsible action to get the economy growing and America working. This fall, I signed into law more than $30 billion in tax cuts for struggling businesses,extended an effective tax credit for homebuyers, and provided additional unemploymentinsurance for one million Americans.  And the Treasury is continuing to adapt our financialstability plan, helping to facilitate the flow of small credit to small businesses and families.  Inaddition, we're working to break down barriers and open overseas markets so our companiescan better compete globally, creating jobs in America by exporting our products around theworld.Now, partly as a result of these and other steps, we are in a very different place today thanwe were one year ago.  We may forget, but we're in a very different place.  We can safely saythat we are no longer facing the potential collapse of our financial system and we've avoidedthe depression many feared.  Our economy is growing for the first time in a year, and theswing from contraction to expansion since the beginning of the year is the largest in nearlythree decades. Finally, we're no longer seeing the severe deterioration in the job market that we once were. In fact we learned on Friday that the unemployment rate fell slightly last month.  This iswelcome news, and news made possible in part by the up to 1.6 million jobs that theRecovery Act has already created and saved according to the Congressional Budget Office.But I'm here today because our work is far from done.  For even though we've reduced thedeluge of job losses to a relative trickle, we are not yet creating jobs at a pace to help allthose families who've been swept up in the flood.  There are more than 7 million fewerAmericans with jobs today than when this recession began.  That's a staggering figure, andone that reflects not only the depths of the hole from which we must ascend, but also acontinuing human tragedy. It was mentioned that I was in Allentown, Pennsylvania, this past weekend, and went to a jobcenter where people were engaged in job search.  And it ran the spectrum -- blacks, whites,Hispanics, young people who were just starting their careers, individuals 50, 60 years old,looking for a job.  And they were putting a brave face on it, confident that eventually thingswould work out, but you could also see the sense of anxiety, the fear that perhaps this time itwas different.Sometimes it's hard to break out of the bubble here in Washington and remind ourselves thatbehind these statistics are people's lives, their capacity to do right by their families.  It speaksto an urgent need to accelerate job growth in the short term while laying a new foundation forlasting economic growth.My economic team has been considering a full range of additional ideas to help accelerate thepace of private sector hiring.  We held a jobs forum at the White House that brought togethersmall business owners, CEOs, union members, economists, folks from non-profits, and stateand local officials to talk about job creation.  And I've asked people to lead forums in theirown communities -- sending the results to me -- so we are hearing as many voices as possibleas we refine our proposals.  We've already heard a number of good ideas, and I know we'lllearn of many more.So today, I want to outline some of the broader steps that I believe should be at the heart ofour effort to accelerate job growth -- those areas that will generate the greatest number ofjobs while generating the greatest value for our economy.First, we're proposing a series of steps to help small businesses grow and hire new staff.  Overthe past 15 years, small businesses have created roughly 65 percent of all new jobs inAmerica.  These are companies formed around kitchen tables in family meetings, formedwhen an entrepreneur takes a chance on a dream, formed when a worker decides it's time shebecame her own boss.  These are also companies that drive innovation, producing 13 timesmore patents per employee than large companies.  And it's worth remembering, every once ina while a small business becomes a big business -- and changes the world.That's why it's so important that we help small business struggling to stay open, or strugglingto open in the first place, during these difficult times.  Building on the tax cuts in the RecoveryAct, we're proposing a complete elimination of capital gains taxes on small businessinvestment along with an extension of write-offs to encourage small businesses to expand inthe coming year.  And I believe it's worthwhile to create a tax incentive to encourage smallbusinesses to add and keep employees, and I'm going to work with Congress to pass one.Now, these steps will help, but we also have to address the continuing struggle of smallbusinesses to get loans that they need to start up and grow.  To that end, we're proposing towaive fees and increase the guarantees for SBA-backed loans.  And I'm asking my TreasurySecretary to continue mobilizing the remaining TARP funds to facilitate lending to smallbusinesses.Second, we're proposing a boost in investment in the nation's infrastructure beyond what wasincluded in the Recovery Act, to continue modernizing our transportation and communicationsnetworks.  These are needed public works that engage private sector companies, spurringhiring all across the country. Already, more than 10,000 of these projects have been funded through the Recovery Act. And by design, Recovery Act work on roads, bridges, water systems, Superfund sites,broadband networks, and clean energy projects will all be ramping up in the months ahead.  Itwas planned this way for two reasons:  so the impact would be felt over a two-year period;and, more importantly, because we wanted to do this right. The potential for abuse in a program of this magnitude, while operating at such a fast pace,was enormous.  So I asked Vice President Biden and others to make sure to the extenthumanly possible that the investments were sound, the projects worthy, and the executionefficient.  What this means is that we're going to see even more work -- and workers -- onrecovery projects in the next six months than we saw in the last six months.Even so, there are many more worthy projects than there were dollars to fund them.  Irecognize that by their nature these projects often take time, and will therefore create jobsover time.  But the need for jobs will also last beyond next year and the benefits of theseinvestments will last years beyond that.  So adding to this initiative to rebuild America'sinfrastructure is the right thing to do. Third, I'm calling on Congress to consider a new program to provide incentives for consumerswho retrofit their homes to become more energy-efficient, which we know creates jobs, savesmoney for families, and reduces the pollution that threatens our environment.  And I'mproposing that we expand select Recovery Act initiatives to promote energy efficiency andclean energy jobs which have been proven to be particularly popular and effective. It's a positive sign that many of these programs drew so many applicants for funding that alot of strong proposals -- proposals that will leverage private capital and create jobs quickly --did not make the cut.  With additional resources, in areas like advanced manufacturing ofwind turbines and solar panels, for instance, we can help turn good ideas into good privatesector jobs.Finally, as we are moving forward in these areas, we should also extend the relief in theRecovery Act, including emergency assistance to seniors, unemployment insurance benefits,COBRA, and relief to states and localities to prevent layoffs.  This will help folks weatheringthese storms, while boosting consumer spending and promoting job growth.Of course, there's only so much government can do. Job creation will ultimately depend on thereal job creators:  businesses across America.  We were encouraged today to hear from theBusiness Roundtable that their survey showed greater confidence and greater potentialinvestment coming out of the business community. Government can help lay the groundwork on which the private sector can better generatejobs, growth, and innovation.  After all, small business tax relief is not a substitute foringenuity and industriousness by our entrepreneurs -- but it can help those with good ideas togrow and expand.Incentives to promote energy efficiency and clean energy manufacturing don't automaticallycreate jobs or lower carbon emissions -- but these steps provide a framework in whichcompanies can compete and innovate to create those jobs and reduce energy consumption. And while modernizing the physical and virtual networks that connect us will create private-sector jobs, they'll do so while making it possible for companies to more easily and effectivelymove their products across this country and around the world, and that will create more jobs.And given the challenges of accelerating the pace of hiring in the private sector, thesetargeted initiatives are right and they are needed.  But with a fiscal crisis to match oureconomic crisis, we also must be prudent about how we fund it.  So to help support theseefforts, we are going to wind down the Troubled Asset Relief Program -- or TARP -- the fundcreated to stabilize the financial system so banks would lend again.I don't think I have to tell you there has rarely been a less loved or more necessaryemergency program than TARP, which -- as galling as the assistance to banks may have been-- indisputably helped prevent a collapse of the entire financial system.  Launched hastily --understandably, but hastily -- under the last administration, the TARP program was flawed,and we have worked hard to correct those flaws and manage it properly.  And today, TARPhas served its original purpose and at much lower cost than we expected.In fact, because of our stewardship of this program, and the transparency and accountabilitywe put in place, TARP is expected to cost the taxpayers at least $200 billion less than whatwas anticipated just this past summer.  And the assistance to banks, once thought to costtaxpayers untold billions, is on track to actually reap billions in profits for the taxpayingpublic.  So this gives us a chance to pay down the deficit faster than we thought possible andto shift funds that would have gone to help the banks on Wall Street to help create jobs onMain Street.Small business, infrastructure, clean energy -- these are areas in which we can put Americansto work while putting our nation on a sturdier economic footing.  That foundation for sustainedeconomic growth -- that must be our continuing focus and our ultimate goal. I've said this before.  Even before this particular crisis, much of our growth for a decade ormore had been fueled by unsustainable consumer debt and reckless financial speculation,while we ignored the fundamental challenges that hold the key to our economic prosperity. We cannot simply go back to the way things used to be.  We can't go back to an economy thatyielded cycle after cycle of speculative booms and painful busts.  We can't continue to acceptan education system in which our students trail their peers in other countries, and a healthcare system in which exploding costs put our businesses at a competitive disadvantage.  Andwe cannot continue to ignore the clean energy challenge or cede global leadership in theemerging industries of the 21st century.  And that's why, even as we strive to meet the crisisof the moment, we have insisted on laying a new foundation for the future.Because an educated workforce is essential to a 21st century global economy, we've launcheda competitive Race to the Top fund through the Recovery Act to reform our schools and raiseachievement, especially in math and science.  And we've made college more affordable,proposed a historic set of reforms and investments in community college, and set a goal ofonce again leading the world in producing college graduates by the year 2020.Because even the best-trained worker in the world can't compete if our businesses aresaddled with rapidly increasing health care costs, we are fighting to do what we havediscussed in this country for generations -- finally reforming our nation's broken healthinsurance system and relieving this unsustainable burden.Because our economic future depends on a financial system that encourages soundinvestments, honest dealings, and long-term growth, we've proposed the most ambitiousfinancial reforms since the Great Depression.  We'll set and enforce clear rules of the road,close loopholes in oversight, charge a new agency with protecting consumers and address thedangerous, systemic risks that brought us to the brink of disaster.  These reforms are movingthrough Congress, we're working to keep those reforms strong, and I'm looking forward tosigning them into law.And because our economic future depends on our leadership in the industries of the future, weare investing in basic applied research, and working to create the incentives to build a newclean energy economy.  For we know the nation that leads in clean energy will be the nationthat leads the world.  I want America to be that nation.  I want America's prosperity to bepowered by what we invent and pioneer -- not just what we borrow and what we consume. And I know that we can and will be that nation if we are willing to do what it takes to getthere.Now, there are those who claim we have to choose between paying down our deficits on theone hand, and investing in job creation and economic growth on the other.  This is a falsechoice.  Ensuring that economic growth and job creation are strong and sustained is critical toensuring that we are increasing revenues and decreasing spending on things likeunemployment insurance so that our deficits will start coming down.  At the same time,instilling confidence in our commitment to being fiscally prudent gives the private sector theconfidence to make long-term investments in our people and in America.So one of the central goals of this administration is restoring fiscal responsibility.  Even as wehave had to spend our way out of this recession in the near term, we've begun to make thehard choices necessary to get our country on a more stable fiscal footing in the long run.  Solet me just be clear here.  Despite what some have claimed, the cost of the Recovery Act isonly a very small part of our current budget imbalance.  In reality, the deficit had beenbuilding dramatically over the previous eight years.  We have a structural gap between themoney going out and the money coming in.Folks passed tax cuts and expansive entitlement programs without paying for any of it -- evenas health care costs kept rising, year after year.  As a result, the deficit had reached $1.3trillion when we walked into the White House.  And I'd note:  These budget-busting tax cutsand spending programs were approved by many of the same people who are now waxingpolitical about fiscal responsibility, while opposing our efforts to reduce deficits by gettinghealth care costs under control.  It's a sight to see.The fact is we have refused to go along with business as usual; we are taking responsibilityfor every dollar we spend.  We've done what some said was impossible:  preventing wastefulspending on outdated weapons systems that even the Pentagon said it didn't want.  We'vecombed the budget, cutting waste and excess wherever we could.  I'm still committed tohalving the deficit we inherited by the end of my first term -- cutting it in half.And I made clear from day one that I would not sign a health insurance reform bill if it raisedthe deficit by one dime -- and neither the House, nor the Senate bill does.  We've begun notonly changing policies in Washington, we've also begun to change the culture in Washington.In the end, the economic crisis of the past year was not just the result of weaknesses in oureconomy.  It was also the result of weaknesses in our political system, because for decades,too many in Washington put off the hard decisions.  For decades, we've watched as efforts tosolve tough problems have fallen prey to the bitterness of partisanship, to prosaic concerns ofpolitics, to ever-quickening news cycles, to endless campaigns focused on scoring pointsinstead of meeting our common challenges.We've seen the consequences of this failure of responsibility.  The American people have paida heavy price.  And the question we'll have to answer now is if we're going to learn from ourpast, or if -- even in the aftermath of disaster -- we're going to repeat those same mistakes. As the alarm bells fade, the din of Washington rises, as the forces of the status quo marshaltheir resources, we can be sure that answering this question will be a fight to the finish.  But Ihave every hope and expectation that we can rise to this moment, that we can transcend thefailures of the past, that we can once again take responsibility for our future.Every night I read letters and e-mails sent to me from people across America -- ordinaryfolks, people who share their hopes and their hardships, their faith in this country, theirfrustration with what's happened in this economy.  I hear from small business owners worriedabout making payroll, keeping their doors open.  I hear from mothers and fathers, sons anddaughters, who've seen one or two or more family members out of work.  The toughest lettersare in children's handwriting -- kids write to me, my dad just lost a job; my grandma is sick,she can't afford health insurance -- kids who can't just be kids because they're worried aboutmom having her hours cut or dad losing a job, or a family without health insurance. These folks aren't looking for a handout, they're not looking for a bailout -- just like thosepeople I visited in Allentown -- all they're looking for is a chance to make their own way, towork, to succeed using their talents and skills.  And they're looking for folks in Washington tohave a seriousness of purpose that matches the reality of their struggle.Everywhere I've gone, every stop I've made, there are people like this, men and women whohave faced misfortune, but who stand ready to build a better future:  students ready to learn,workers eager to work, scientists on the brink of discovery, entrepreneurs seeking the chanceto open a small business.  Everywhere I go, there are once-shuttered factories just waiting towhir back to life in burgeoning industries.  There is a nation ready to meet the challenges ofthis new age and to lead the world in this new century.  And as we look back on the progressof the past year, and look forward to the work ahead, I have every confidence that we will doexactly that.These have been a tough two years.  And there will no doubt be difficult months ahead.  Butthe storms of the past are receding.  The skies are brightening.  And the horizon is beckoningonce more.Thank you very much.",obama

"Good morning. It is an honor for me to join this distinguished group of leaders from nationsaround the world. We come here in Copenhagen because climate change poses a grave andgrowing danger to our people. All of you would not be here unless you -- like me -- wereconvinced that this danger is real. This is not fiction, it is science. Unchecked, climate changewill pose unacceptable risks to our security, our economies, and our planet. This much weknow.The question, then, before us is no longer the nature of the challenge. The question is ourcapacity to meet it. For while the reality of climate change is not in doubt, I have to behonest, as the world watches us today, I think our ability to take collective action is in doubtright now, and it hangs in the balance.I believe we can act boldly, and decisively, in the face of a common threat. That's why I comehere today -- not to talk, but to act.Now, as the world's largest economy and as the world's second largest emitter, America bearsour responsibility to address climate change, and we intend to meet that responsibility. That'swhy we've renewed our leadership within international climate change negotiations. That'swhy we've worked with other nations to phase out fossil fuel subsidies.That's why we've taken bold action at home -- by making historic investments in renewableenergy; by putting our people to work increasing efficiency in our homes and buildings; andby pursuing comprehensive legislation to transform to a clean energy economy.These mitigation actions are ambitious, and we are taking them not simply to meet globalresponsibilities. We are convinced, as some of you may be convinced, that changing the waywe produce and use energy is essential to America's economic future -- that it will createmillions of new jobs, power new industries, keep us competitive, and spark new innovation.We're convinced, for our own self-interest, that the way we use energy, changing it to a moreefficient fashion, is essential to our national security, because it helps to reduce ourdependence on foreign oil, and helps us deal with some of the dangers posed by climatechange.So I want this plenary session to understand, America is going to continue on this course ofaction to mitigate our emissions and to move towards a clean energy economy, no matterwhat happens here in Copenhagen. We think it is good for us, as well as good for the world.But we also believe that we will all be stronger, all be safer, all be more secure if we acttogether. That's why it is in our mutual interest to achieve a global accord in which we agreeto certain steps, and to hold each other accountable to certain commitments.After months of talk, after two weeks of negotiations, after innumerable side meetings,bilateral meetings, endless hours of discussion among negotiators, I believe that the pieces ofthat accord should now be clear.First, all major economies must put forward decisive national actions that will reduce theiremissions, and begin to turn the corner on climate change. I'm pleased that many of us havealready done so. Almost all the major economies have put forward legitimate targets,significant targets, ambitious targets. And I'm confident that America will fulfill thecommitments that we have made: cutting our emissions in the range of 17 percent by 2020,and by more than 80 percent by 2050 in line with final legislation.Second, we must have a mechanism to review whether we are keeping our commitments, andexchange this information in a transparent manner. These measures need not be intrusive, orinfringe upon sovereignty. They must, however, ensure that an accord is credible, and thatwe're living up to our obligations. Without such accountability, any agreement would be emptywords on a page.I don't know how you have an international agreement where we all are not sharinginformation and ensuring that we are meeting our commitments. That doesn't make sense. Itwould be a hollow victory.Number three, we must have financing that helps developing countries adapt, particularly theleast developed and most vulnerable countries to climate change. America will be a part offast-start funding that will ramp up to $10 billion by 2012. And yesterday, Secretary HillaryClinton, my Secretary of State, made it clear that we will engage in a global effort to mobilize$100 billion in financing by 2020, if -- and only if -- it is part of a broader accord that I havejust described.Mitigation. Transparency. Financing. It's a clear formula -- one that embraces the principle ofcommon but differentiated responses and respective capabilities. And it adds up to asignificant accord -- one that takes us farther than we have ever gone before as aninternational community.I just want to say to this plenary session that we are running short on time. And at this point,the question is whether we will move forward together or split apart, whether we preferposturing to action. I'm sure that many consider this an imperfect framework that I justdescribed. No country will get everything that it wants. There are those developing countriesthat want aid with no strings attached, and no obligations with respect to transparency. Theythink that the most advanced nations should pay a higher price. I understand that. There arethose advanced nations who think that developing countries either cannot absorb thisassistance, or that will not be held accountable effectively, and that the world's fastest-growing emitters should bear a greater share of the burden.We know the fault lines because we've been imprisoned by them for years. Theseinternational discussions have essentially taken place now for almost two decades, and wehave very little to show for it other than an increased acceleration of the climate changephenomenon. The time for talk is over. This is the bottom line: We can embrace this accord,take a substantial step forward, continue to refine it and build upon its foundation. We can dothat, and everyone who is in this room will be part of a historic endeavor -- one that makeslife better for our children and our grandchildren.Or we can choose delay, falling back into the same divisions that have stood in the way ofaction for years. And we will be back having the same stale arguments month after month,year after year, perhaps decade after decade, all while the danger of climate change growsuntil it is irreversible.Ladies and gentlemen, there is no time to waste. America has made our choice. We havecharted our course. We have made our commitments. We will do what we say. Now I believeit's the time for the nations and the people of the world to come together behind a commonpurpose. We are ready to get this done today -- but there has to be movement on all sides torecognize that it is better for us to act than to talk; its better for us to choose action overinaction; the future over the past -- and with courage and faith, I believe that we can meetour responsibility to our people, and the future of our planet.Thank you very much.",obama
"Good morning, everybody. I wanted to take just a few minutes to update the American peopleon the attempted terrorist attack that occurred on Christmas Day and the steps we're takingto ensure the safety and security of the country.The investigation's ongoing. And I spoke again this morning with Attorney General Eric Holder,the secretary of homeland security, Janet Napolitano, and my counterterrorism and homelandsecurity adviser, John Brennan. I asked them to keep -- continue monitoring the situation tokeep the American people and members of Congress informed.Now, here's what we know so far: On Christmas Day, Northwest Airlines Flight 253 was enroute from Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Detroit. As the plane made its final approach toDetroit Metropolitan Airport, a passenger allegedly tried to ignite an explosive device on hisbody, setting off a fire. Thanks to the quick and heroic actions of passengers and crew, thesuspect was immediately subdued, the fire was put out, and the plane landed safely. Thesuspect is now in custody and has been charged with attempting to destroy an aircraft. And afull investigation has been launched into this attempted act of terrorism, and we will not restuntil we find all who were involved and hold them accountable.Now, this was a serious reminder of the dangers that we face and the nature of those whothreaten our homeland. Had the suspect succeeded in bringing down that plane, it could havekilled nearly 300 passengers and crew, innocent civilians preparing to celebrate the holidayswith their families and friends. The American people should be assured that we are doingeverything in our power to keep you and your family safe and secure during this busy holidayseason. Since I was first notified of this incident, I've ordered the following actions to be taken toprotect the American people and to secure air travel. First, I directed that we take immediate steps to ensure the safety of the traveling public. Wemade sure that all flights still in the air were secure and could land safely. We immediatelyenhanced screening and security procedures for all flights, domestic and international. Weadded federal air marshals to flights entering and leaving the United States. And we'reworking closely in this country, federal, state and local law enforcement, with our internationalpartners.Second, I've ordered two important reviews, because it's absolutely critical that we learn fromthis incident and take the necessary measures to prevent future acts of terrorism.The first review involves our watch list system, which our government has had in place formany years to identify known and suspected terrorists so that we can prevent their entry intothe United States. Apparently the suspect in the Christmas incident was in this system, butnot on a watch list, such as the so-called no-fly list. So I have ordered a thorough review, notonly of how information related to the subject was handled, but of the overall watch listsystem and how it can be strengthened.The second review will examine all screening policies, technologies, and procedures related toair travel. We need to determine just how the suspect was able to bring dangerous explosivesaboard an aircraft and what additional steps we can take to thwart future attacks.Third, I've directed my national security team to keep up the pressure on those who wouldattack our country. We do not yet have all the answers about this latest attempt, but thosewho would slaughter innocent men, women, and children must know that the United Stateswill more -- do more than simply strengthen our defenses. We will continue to use everyelement of our national power to disrupt, to dismantle, and defeat the violent extremists whothreaten us, whether they are from Afghanistan or Pakistan, Yemen or Somalia, or anywherewhere they are plotting attacks against the U.S. homeland.Finally, the American people should remain vigilant, but also be confident. Those plottingagainst us seek not only to undermine our security, but also the open society and the valuesthat we cherish as Americans. This incident, like several that have preceded it, demonstratesthat an alert and courageous citizenry are far more resilient than an isolated extremist.As a nation, we will do everything in our power to protect our country. As Americans, we willnever give in to fear or division. We will be guided by our hopes, our unity, and our deeplyheld values.That's who we are as Americans.That's what our brave men and women in uniform are standing up for as they spend theholidays in harm's way.And we will continue to do everything that we can to keep America safe in the new year andbeyond.Before I leave, let me also briefly address the events that have taken place over the last fewdays in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The United States joins with the international communityin strongly condemning the violent and unjust suppression of innocent Iranian citizens, whichhas apparently resulted in detentions, injuries, and even death.For months, the Iranian people have sought nothing more than to exercise their universalrights. Each time they have done so, they have been met with the iron fist of brutality, evenon solemn occasions and holy days. And each time that has happened, the world has watchedwith deep admiration for the courage and the conviction of the Iranian people who are part ofIran's great and enduring civilization.What's taking place within Iran is not about the United States or any other country. It's aboutthe Iranian people and their aspirations for justice and a better life for themselves. And thedecision of Iran's leaders to govern through fear and tyranny will not succeed in making thoseaspirations go away.As I said in Oslo, it's telling when governments fear the aspirations [of] their own people morethan the power of any other nation.Along with all free nations, the United States stands with those who seek their universalrights. We call upon the Iranian government to abide by the international obligations that ithas to respect the rights of its own people.We call for the immediate release of all who have been unjustly detained within Iran.We will continue to bear witness to the extraordinary events that are taking place there. AndI'm confident that history will be on the side of those who seek justice.Thank you very much, everybody. And happy New Year.",obama
"I just concluded a meeting with members of my national security team, including those fromour intelligence, homeland security and law enforcement agencies involved in the securityreviews that I ordered after the failed attack on Christmas Day.     I called these leaders to the White House because we face a challenge of the utmosturgency. As we saw on Christmas, al Qaeda and its extremist allies will stop at nothing in theirefforts to kill Americans.  And we are determined not only to thwart those plans, but todisrupt, dismantle and defeat their networks once and for all.Indeed, over the past year, we've taken the fight to al Qaeda and its allies wherever they plotand train, be it in Afghanistan and Pakistan, in Yemen and Somalia, or in other countriesaround the world.Here at home, our intelligence, homeland security and law enforcement agencies have workedtogether with considerable success: gathering intelligence, stitching it together, and makingarrests -- from Denver to Texas, from Illinois to New York -- disrupting plots and savingAmerican lives.  And these successes have not come without a price, as we saw last week inthe loss of our courageous CIA officers in Afghanistan.But when a suspected terrorist is able to board a plane with explosives on Christmas Day thesystem has failed in a potentially disastrous way.  And it's my responsibility to find out why,and to correct that failure so that we can prevent such attacks in the future.And that's why, shortly after the attempted bombing over Detroit, I ordered two reviews.  Idirected Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano to review aviation screening,technology and procedures.  She briefed me on her initial findings today, and I'm pleased thatthis review is drawing on the best science and technology, including the expertise of Secretaryof Energy Steven Chu and his department.I also directed my counterterrorism and homeland security advisor John Brennan to lead athorough review into our terrorist watch-listing system so we can fix what went wrong.  As wediscussed today, this ongoing review continues to reveal more about the human and systemicfailures that almost cost nearly 300 lives.  We will make a summary of this preliminary reportpublic within the next few days, but let me share some of what we know so far.As I described over the weekend, elements of our intelligence community knew that UmarFarouk Abdulmutallab had traveled to Yemen and joined up with extremists there.  It nowturns out that our intelligence community knew of other red flags -- that al Qaeda in theArabian Peninsula sought to strike not only American targets in Yemen, but the United Statesitself.  And we had information that this group was working with an individual who was known-- who we now know was in fact the individual involved in the Christmas attack.The bottom line is this:  The U.S. government had sufficient information to have uncoveredthis plot and potentially disrupt the Christmas Day attack.  But our intelligence communityfailed to connect those dots, which would have placed the suspect on the ""no fly"" list. In otherwords, this was not a failure to collect intelligence; it was a failure to integrate andunderstand the intelligence that we already had.  The information was there.  Agencies andanalysts who needed it had access to it.  And our professionals were trained to look for it andto bring it all together.Now, I will accept that intelligence, by its nature, is imperfect, but it is increasingly clear thatintelligence was not fully analyzed or fully leveraged.  That's not acceptable, and I will nottolerate it.  Time and again, we've learned that quickly piecing together information andtaking swift action is critical to staying one step ahead of a nimble adversary.So we have to do better -- and we will do better.  And we have to do it quickly.  Americanlives are on the line.  So I made it clear today to my team:  I want our initial reviewscompleted this week.  I want specific recommendations for corrective actions to fix what wentwrong.  I want those reforms implemented immediately, so that this doesn't happen againand so we can prevent future attacks.  And I know that every member of my team that I metwith today understands the urgency of getting this right.  And I appreciate that each of themtook responsibility for the shortfalls within their own agencies.Immediately after the attack, I ordered concrete steps to protect the American people:  newscreening and security for all flights, domestic and international; more explosive detectionteams at airports; more air marshals on flights; and deepening cooperation with internationalpartners.In recent days, we've taken additional steps to improve security.  Counterterrorism officialshave reviewed and updated our terrorist watch list system, including adding more individualsto the ""no fly"" list.  And while our review has found that our watch-listing system is notbroken, the failure to add Abdulmutallab to the ""no fly"" list shows that this system needs to bestrengthened.The State Department is now requiring embassies and consulates to include current visainformation in their warning on individuals with terrorist or suspected terrorist connections. As of yesterday, the Transportation Security Administration, or TSA, is requiring enhancedscreening for passengers flying into the United States from, or flying through, nations on ourlist of state sponsors of terrorism, or other countries of interest.  And in the days ahead, I willannounce further steps to disrupt attacks, including better integration of information andenhanced passenger screening for air travel.Finally, some have suggested that the events on Christmas Day should cause us to revisit thedecision to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay.  So let me be clear.  It was always our intentto transfer detainees to other countries only under conditions that provide assurances that oursecurity is being protected.With respect to Yemen in particular, there's an ongoing security situation which we have beenconfronting for some time, along with our Yemeni partner.  Given the unsettled situation, I'vespoken to the Attorney General and we've agreed that we will not be transferring additionaldetainees back to Yemen at this time.But make no mistake:  We will close Guantanamo prison, which has damaged our nationalsecurity interests and become a tremendous recruiting tool for al Qaeda.  In fact, that was anexplicit rationale for the formation of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.  And, as I've alwayssaid, we will do so -- we will close the prison in a manner that keeps the American people safeand secure.Our reviews -- and the steps that we've taken and will continue to take -- go to the heart ofthe kind of intelligence and homeland security we need in the 21st century.  Just as al Qaedaand its allies are constantly evolving and adapting their efforts to strike us, we have toconstantly adapt and evolve to defeat them, because as we saw on Christmas, the margin forerror is slim and the consequences of failure can be catastrophic.As these violent extremists pursue new havens, we intend to target al Qaeda wherever theytake root, forging new partnerships to deny them sanctuary, as we are doing currently withthe government in Yemen.  As our adversaries seek new recruits, we'll constantly review andrapidly update our intelligence and our institutions.  As they refine our tactics, we'll enhanceour defenses, including smarter screening and security at airports, and investing in thetechnologies that might have detected the kind of explosives used on Christmas.  In short, we need our intelligence, homeland security and law enforcement systems -- and thepeople in them -- to be accountable and to work as intended:  collecting, sharing, integrating,analyzing, and acting on intelligence as quickly and effectively as possible to save innocentlives -- not just most of the time, but all the time.  That's what the American people deserve.As President, that's exactly what I will demand.Thank you very much.",obama
"Good afternoon, everybody.  The immediate reviews that I ordered after the failed Christmasterrorist attack are now complete.  I was just briefed on the findings and recommendations forreform, and I believe it's important that the American people understand the new steps thatwe're taking to prevent attacks and keep our country safe. This afternoon, my Counterterrorism and Homeland Security Advisor, John Brennan, willdiscuss his review into our terrorist watchlist system -- how our government failed to connectthe dots in a way that would have prevented a known terrorist from boarding a plane forAmerica, and the steps we're going to take to prevent that from happening again.Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano will discuss her review of aviation screening,technology and procedures -- how that terrorist boarded a plane with explosives that couldhave killed nearly 300 innocent people, and how we'll strengthen aviation security goingforward.So today I want to just briefly summarize their conclusions and the steps that I've ordered toaddress them.In our ever-changing world, America's first line of defense is timely, accurate intelligence thatis shared, integrated, analyzed, and acted upon quickly and effectively.  That's what theintelligence reforms after the 9/11 attacks largely achieved. That's what our intelligencecommunity does every day.  But, unfortunately, that's not what happened in the lead-up toChristmas Day.  It's now clear that shortcomings occurred in three broad and compoundingways. First, although our intelligence community had learned a great deal about the al Qaedaaffiliate in Yemen -- called al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula -- that we knew that they soughtto strike the United States and that they were recruiting operatives to do so -- the intelligencecommunity did not aggressively follow up on and prioritize particular streams of intelligencerelated to a possible attack against the homeland.Second, this contributed to a larger failure of analysis -- a failure to connect the dots ofintelligence that existed across our intelligence community and which, together, could haverevealed that Abdulmutallab was planning an attack.Third, this, in turn, fed into shortcomings in the watch-listing system which resulted in thisperson not being placed on the ""no fly"" list, thereby allowing him to board that plane inAmsterdam for Detroit.   In sum, the U.S. government had the information -- scattered throughout the system -- topotentially uncover this plot and disrupt the attack.  Rather than a failure to collect or shareintelligence, this was a failure to connect and understand the intelligence that we already had.That's why we took swift action in the immediate days following Christmas, includingreviewing and updating the terrorist watchlist system and adding more individuals to the ""nofly"" list, and directing our embassies and consulates to include current visa information in theirwarnings of individuals with terrorist or suspected terrorist ties. Today, I'm directing a series of additional corrective steps across multiple agencies.  Broadlyspeaking, they fall into four areas.First, I'm directing that our intelligence community immediately begin assigning specificresponsibility for investigating all leads on high-priority threats so that these leads arepursued and acted upon aggressively -- not just most of the time, but all of the time.  Wemust follow the leads that we get.  And we must pursue them until plots are disrupted.  Andthat mean assigning clear lines of responsibility.Second, I'm directing that intelligence reports, especially those involving potential threats tothe United States, be distributed more rapidly and more widely.  We can't sit on informationthat could protect the American people.Third, I'm directing that we strengthen the analytical process, how our analysis -- how ouranalysts process and integrate the intelligence that they receive.  My Director of NationalIntelligence, Denny Blair, will take the lead in improving our day-to-day efforts.  MyIntelligence Advisory Board will examine the longer-term challenge of sifting through vastuniverses of intelligence and data in our Information Age.   And finally, I'm ordering an immediate effort to strengthen the criteria used to add individualsto our terrorist watchlists, especially the ""no fly"" list.  We must do better in keeping dangerouspeople off airplanes, while still facilitating air travel.So taken together, these reforms will improve the intelligence community's ability to collect,share, integrate, analyze, and act on intelligence swiftly and effectively.  In short, they willhelp our intelligence community do its job even better and protect American lives.But even the best intelligence can't identify in advance every individual who would do usharm.  So we need the security -- at our airports, ports, and borders, and through ourpartnerships with other nations -- to prevent terrorists from entering America. At the Amsterdam airport, Abdulmutallab was subjected to the same screening as otherpassengers.  He was required to show his documents -- including a valid U.S. visa.  His carry-on bag was X-rayed.  He passed through a metal detector.  But a metal detector can't detectthe kind of explosives that were sewn into his clothes.As Secretary Napolitano will explain, the screening technologies that might have detectedthese explosives are in use at the Amsterdam airport, but not at the specific checkpoints thathe passed through.  Indeed, most airports in the world -- and in the United States -- do notyet have these technologies.  Now, there's no silver bullet to securing the thousands of flightsinto America each day, domestic and international.  It will require significant investments inmany areas.  And that's why, even before the Christmas attack, we increased investments inhomeland security and aviation security.  This includes an additional one billion dollars in newsystems and technologies that we need to protect our airports -- more baggage screening,more passenger screening and more advanced explosive detection capabilities, including thosethat can improve our ability to detect the kind of explosive used on Christmas.  These aremajor investments and they'll make our skies safer and more secure.As I announced this week, we've taken a whole range of steps to improve aviation screeningand security since Christmas, including new rules for how we handle visas within thegovernment and enhanced screening for passengers flying from, or through, certaincountries. And today, I'm directing that the Department of Homeland Security take additional steps,including:  strengthening our international partnerships to improve aviation screening andsecurity around the world; greater use of the advanced explosive detection technologies thatwe already have, including imaging technology; and working aggressively, in cooperation withthe Department of Energy and our National Labs, to develop and deploy the next generationof screening technologies.Now, there is, of course, no foolproof solution.  As we develop new screening technologies andprocedures, our adversaries will seek new ways to evade them, as was shown by theChristmas attack.  In the never-ending race to protect our country, we have to stay one stepahead of a nimble adversary.  That's what these steps are designed to do.  And we willcontinue to work with Congress to ensure that our intelligence, homeland security, and lawenforcement communities have the resources they need to keep the American people safe.I ordered these two immediate reviews so that we could take immediate action to secure ourcountry.  But in the weeks and months ahead, we will continue a sustained and intensiveeffort of analysis and assessment, so that we leave no stone unturned in seeking better waysto protect the American people.  I have repeatedly made it clear -- in public with the American people, and in private with mynational security team -- that I will hold my staff, our agencies and the people in themaccountable when they fail to perform their responsibilities at the highest levels. Now, at this stage in the review process it appears that this incident was not the fault of asingle individual or organization, but rather a systemic failure across organizations andagencies.  That's why, in addition to the corrective efforts that I've ordered, I've directedagency heads to establish internal accountability reviews, and directed my national securitystaff to monitor their efforts.  We will measure progress.  And John Brennan will report back tome within 30 days and on a regular basis after that.  All of these agencies -- and their leaders-- are responsible for implementing these reforms. And all will be held accountable if theydon't. Moreover, I am less interested in passing out blame than I am in learning from and correctingthese mistakes to make us safer.  For ultimately, the buck stops with me.  As President, Ihave a solemn responsibility to protect our nation and our people.  And when the system fails,it is my responsibility. Over the past two weeks, we've been reminded again of the challenge we face in protectingour country against a foe that is bent on our destruction.  And while passions and politics canoften obscure the hard work before us, let's be clear about what this moment demands.  Weare at war.  We are at war against al Qaeda, a far-reaching network of violence and hatredthat attacked us on 9/11, that killed nearly 3,000 innocent people, and that is plotting tostrike us again.  And we will do whatever it takes to defeat them.And we've made progress.  Al Qaeda's leadership is hunkered down.  We have worked closelywith partners, including Yemen, to inflict major blows against al Qaeda leaders.  And we havedisrupted plots at home and abroad, and saved American lives.And we know that the vast majority of Muslims reject al Qaeda.  But it is clear that al Qaedaincreasingly seeks to recruit individuals without known terrorist affiliations not just in theMiddle East, but in Africa and other places, to do their bidding.  That's why I've directed mynational security team to develop a strategy that addresses the unique challenges posed bylone recruits.  And that's why we must communicate clearly to Muslims around the world thatal Qaeda offers nothing except a bankrupt vision of misery and death - including the murderof fellow Muslims - while the United States stands with those who seek justice and progress.To advance that progress, we've sought new beginnings with Muslim communities around theworld, one in which we engage on the basis of mutual interest and mutual respect, and worktogether to fulfill the aspirations that all people share -- to get an education, to work withdignity, to live in peace and security.  That's what America believes in.  That's the vision thatis far more powerful than the hatred of these violent extremists.Here at home, we will strengthen our defenses, but we will not succumb to a siege mentalitythat sacrifices the open society and liberties and values that we cherish as Americans,because great and proud nations don't hunker down and hide behind walls of suspicion andmistrust.  That is exactly what our adversaries want, and so long as I am President, we willnever hand them that victory.  We will define the character of our country, not some band ofsmall men intent on killing innocent men, women and children.And in this cause, every one of us -- every American, every elected official -- can do our part. Instead of giving into cynicism and division, let's move forward with the confidence andoptimism and unity that defines us as a people.  For now is not a time for partisanship, it's atime for citizenship -- a time to come together and work together with the seriousness ofpurpose that our national security demands.That's what it means to be strong in the face of violent extremism.  That's how we will prevailin this fight.  And that's how we will protect our country and pass it -- safer and stronger -- tothe next generation.Thanks very much.",obama
"Thank you, everybody, for being here.As we all know, our country has endured the deepest recession we've faced ingenerations. And much of the turmoil was caused by irresponsibility on the part of banks andfinancial institutions. Firms took reckless risks in pursuit of short-term profits and soaringbonuses, triggering a financial crisis that nearly pulled the economy into a second GreatDepression.It was little more than a year ago that we stood on that precipice. Several of the world'slargest financial institutions had already failed. Credit markets froze and banks refused tolend. Trillions of dollars in household savings evaporated as stocks, pensions, and homevalues plummeted. And we were losing hundreds of thousands of jobs each month. It was atthis time that many large financial firms -- those left standing -- teetered on the brink ofcollapse, overwhelmed by the consequences of their irresponsible decisions.Now, even though these firms were largely facing a crisis of their own making, their failurecould have led to an even greater calamity for the country. So the Federal Reserve and otheragencies took emergency measures to prevent that outcome. And the previous Administrationstarted a program -- the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP -- to provide these financialinstitutions with funds to survive the turmoil that they had helped unleash. It was a distastefulbut necessary thing to do.Now, we've worked over the last year to manage this program effectively, to hold firmsaccountable, and to recoup as much tax money as possible. Many originally feared that mostof the 700 billion dollars in TARP money would be lost. But because of the management of thisprogram by Secretary Geithner and my economic team, we've now recovered the majority ofthe funds provided to banks.As far as I'm concerned, however, that's not good enough. My commitment is to thetaxpayer.  My commitment is to recover every single dime the American people are owed. Andmy determination to achieve this goal is only heightened when I see reports of massive profitsand obscene bonuses at some of the very firms who owe their continued existence to theAmerican people -- folks who have not been made whole, and who continue to face realhardship in this recession.We want our money back. And we're going to get it.And that's why I'm proposing a ""Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee"" to be imposed on majorfinancial firms until the American people are fully compensated for the extraordinaryassistance they provided to Wall Street. If these companies are in good enough shape toafford massive bonuses, they are surely in good enough shape to afford paying back everypenny to taxpayers.Now, our estimate is that the TARP program will end up costing taxpayers around 117 billiondollars -- obviously a lot less than the 700 billion that people had feared, but still a lot ofmoney. The fee will be in place for 10 years, or as long as it takes to raise the full amountnecessary to cover all taxpayer losses. This will not be a cost borne by community banks orsmall financial firms. Only the largest firms with more than 50 billion dollars in assets will beaffected. And the size of the fee each bank owes will be based on its size and exposure todebt, so that we are recovering tax dollars while promoting reform of the banking practicesthat contributed to this crisis.Now, the fact is these financial institutions are essential to our economy. They provide capitaland credit to families purchasing homes, students attending college, businesses seeking tostart up or expand. And that's why the rescue program was as necessary as it wasunfortunate.  And that is why, through this fee and broader reforms that we seek, our goal isnot to punish Wall Street firms, but rather to prevent the abuse and excess that nearly causedthe collapse of many of these firms and the financial system itself.We cannot go back to ""business as usual."" And when we see reports of firms once againengaging in risky bets to reap quick rewards, when we see a return to compensation practicesthat seem not to reflect what the country has been through, all that looks like business asusual to me. The financial industry has even launched a massive lobbying campaign, lockingarms with the opposition Party, to stand in the way of reforms to prevent another crisis. That,too, unfortunately, is business as usual. And we're already hearing a hue and cry from WallStreet suggesting that this proposed fee is not only unwelcome but unfair -- that by sometwisted logic it is more appropriate for the American people to bear the costs of the bailout,rather than the industry that benefited from it, even though these executives are out theregiving themselves huge bonuses.What I'd say to these executives is this: Instead of sending a phalanx of lobbyists to fight thisproposal, or employing an army of lawyers and accountants to help evade the fee, I suggestyou might want to consider simply meeting your responsibilities. And I'd urge you to cover thecosts of the rescue not by sticking it to your shareholders or your customers or fellow citizenswith the bill, but by rolling back bonuses for top earners and executives. And more broadly, Iam continuing to call on these firms to put greater effort into helping families stay in theirhomes, to provide small businesses with needed loans, and to embrace -- rather than fight --serious financial reform.Ultimately, it is by taking responsibility -- on Wall Street, here in Washington, all the way toMain Street -- that we're going to move past this period of turmoil. That's how we're going toavoid the cycles of boom and bust that have caused so much havoc. That's how we're going topromote vibrant markets that reward innovation and entrepreneurship and hard work. That'show we're going to create sustained growth without the looming threat of another costlycrisis. That's not only in the best interests of the economy as a whole; it's actually in theinterest of these large banks.So, I'm going to be working closely with Congress on this proposal.And on behalf of the American people, I look forward to signing it into law.Thank you very much.",obama
"Good morning.  Praise be to God.  Let me begin by thanking the entire Vermont AvenueBaptist Church family for welcoming our family here today.  It feels like a family.  Thank youfor making us feel that way.  To Pastor Wheeler, first lady Wheeler, thank you so much forwelcoming us here today.  Congratulations on Jordan Denice -- aka Cornelia.  Michelle and I have been blessed with a new nephew this year as well -- Austin LucasRobinson.  So maybe at the appropriate time we can make introductions. Now, if Jordan'sfather is like me, then that will be in about 30 years. That is a great blessing.Michelle and Malia and Sasha and I are thrilled to be here today.  And I know that sometimesyou have to go through a little fuss to have me as a guest speaker. So let me apologize inadvance for all the fuss. We gather here, on a Sabbath, during a time of profound difficulty for our nation and for ourworld.  In such a time, it soothes the soul to seek out the Divine in a spirit of prayer; to seeksolace among a community of believers.  But we are not here just to ask the Lord for Hisblessing.  We aren't here just to interpret His Scripture.  We're also here to call on thememory of one of His noble servants, the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.Now, it's fitting that we do so here, within the four walls of Vermont Avenue Baptist Church --here, in a church that rose like the phoenix from the ashes of the civil war; here in a churchformed by freed slaves, whose founding pastor had worn the union blue; here in a churchfrom whose pews congregants set out for marches and from whom choir anthems of freedomwere heard; from whose sanctuary King himself would sermonize from time to time. One of those times was Thursday, December 6, 1956.  Pastor, you said you were a little olderthan me, so were you around at that point? You were three years old -- okay. I wasnt bornyet. On Thursday, December 6, 1956.  And before Dr. King had pointed us to the mountaintop,before he told us about his dream in front of the Lincoln Memorial, King came here, as a 27-year-old preacher, to speak on what he called ""The Challenge of a New Age.""  ""The Challengeof a New Age.""  It was a period of triumph, but also uncertainty, for Dr. King and his followers-- because just weeks earlier, the Supreme Court had ordered the desegregation ofMontgomery's buses, a hard-wrought, hard-fought victory that would put an end to the 381-day historic boycott down in Montgomery, Alabama. And yet, as Dr. King rose to take that pulpit, the future still seemed daunting.  It wasn't clearwhat would come next for the movement that Dr. King led.  It wasn't clear how we were goingto reach the Promised Land.  Because segregation was still rife; lynchings still a fact.  Yes, theSupreme Court had ruled not only on the Montgomery buses, but also on Brown v. Board ofEducation.  And yet that ruling was defied throughout the South -- by schools and by states;they ignored it with impunity.  And here in the nation's capital, the federal government hadyet to fully align itself with the laws on its books and the ideals of its founding.  So it's not hard for us, then, to imagine that moment.  We can imagine folks coming to thischurch, happy about the boycott being over.  We can also imagine them, though, coming hereconcerned about their future, sometimes second-guessing strategy, maybe fighting off somecreeping doubts, perhaps despairing about whether the movement in which they had placedso many of their hopes -- a movement in which they believed so deeply -- could actuallydeliver on its promise. So here we are, more than half a century later, once again facing the challenges of a newage.  Here we are, once more marching toward an unknown future, what I call the Joshuageneration to their Moses generation -- the great inheritors of progress paid for with sweatand blood, and sometimes life itself.  We've inherited the progress of unjust laws that are now overturned.  We take for granted theprogress of a ballot being available to anybody who wants to take the time to actually vote.We enjoy the fruits of prejudice and bigotry being lifted -- slowly, sometimes in fits and starts,but irrevocably -- from human hearts.  It's that progress that made it possible for me to behere today; for the good people of this country to elect an African American the 44thPresident of the United States of America.Reverend Wheeler mentioned the inauguration, last year's election.  You know, on the heels ofthat victory over a year ago, there were some who suggested that somehow we had enteredinto a post-racial America, all those problems would be solved.  There were those who arguedthat because I had spoke of a need for unity in this country that our nation was somehowentering into a period of post-partisanship.  That didnt work out so well.  There was a hopeshared by many that life would be better from the moment that I swore that oath. Of course, as we meet here today, one year later, we know the promise of that moment hasnot yet been fully fulfilled.  Because of an era of greed and irresponsibility that sowed theseeds of its own demise, because of persistent economic troubles unaddressed through thegenerations, because of a banking crisis that brought the financial system to the brink ofcatastrophe, we are being tested -- in our own lives and as a nation -- as few have beentested before. Unemployment is at its highest level in more than a quarter of a century.  Nowhere is it higherthan the African American community.  Poverty is on the rise.  Home ownership is slipping.Beyond our shores, our sons and daughters are fighting two wars. Closer to home, our Haitianbrothers and sisters are in desperate need.  Bruised, battered, many people are legitimatelyfeeling doubt, even despair, about the future.  Like those who came to this church on thatThursday in 1956, folks are wondering, where do we go from here? I understand those feelings.  I understand the frustration and sometimes anger that so manyfolks feel as they struggle to stay afloat.  I get letters from folks around the country everyday; I read 10 a night out of the 40,000 that we receive.  And there are stories of hardshipand desperation, in some cases, pleading for help:  I need a job.  I'm about to lose my home. I don't have health care -- it's about to cause my family to be bankrupt.  Sometimes you getletters from children:  My mama or my daddy have lost their jobs, is there something you cando to help?  Ten letters like that a day we read.So, yes, we're passing through a hard winter.  It's the hardest in some time.  But let's alwaysremember that, as a people, the American people, we've weathered some hard wintersbefore.  This country was founded during some harsh winters.  The fishermen, the laborers,the craftsmen who made camp at Valley Forge -- they weathered a hard winter.  The slavesand the freedmen who rode an underground railroad, seeking the light of justice under thecover of night -- they weathered a hard winter. The seamstress whose feet were tired, thepastor whose voice echoes through the ages -- they weathered some hard winters.  It was forthem, as it is for us, difficult, in the dead of winter, to sometimes see spring coming.  They,too, sometimes felt their hopes deflate.  And yet, each season, the frost melts, the coldrecedes, the sun reappears.  So it was for earlier generations and so it will be for us. What we need to do is to just ask what lessons we can learn from those earlier generationsabout how they sustained themselves during those hard winters, how they persevered andprevailed.  Let us in this Joshua generation learn how that Moses generation overcame.Let me offer a few thoughts on this.  First and foremost, they did so by remaining firm in theirresolve.  Despite being threatened by sniper fire or planted bombs, by shoving and punchingand spitting and angry stares, they adhered to that sweet spirit of resistance, the principles ofnonviolence that had accounted for their success. Second, they understood that as much as our government and our political parties hadbetrayed them in the past -- as much as our nation itself had betrayed its own ideals --government, if aligned with the interests of its people, can be -- and must be  -- a force forgood.  So they stayed on the Justice Department.  They went into the courts.  They pressuredCongress, they pressured their President.  They didnt give up on this country. They didntgive up on government.  They didnt somehow say government was the problem; they said,we're going to change government, we're going to make it better.  Imperfect as it was, theycontinued to believe in the promise of democracy; in America's constant ability to remakeitself, to perfect this union. Third, our predecessors were never so consumed with theoretical debates that they couldn'tsee progress when it came. Sometimes I get a little frustrated when folks just don't want tosee that even if we don't get everything, we're getting something. King understood that thedesegregation of the Armed Forces didnt end the civil rights movement, because black andwhite soldiers still couldn't sit together at the same lunch counter when they came home.  Buthe still insisted on the rightness of desegregating the Armed Forces.  That was a good firststep -- even as he called for more.  He didnt suggest that somehow by the signing of the CivilRights that somehow all discrimination would end.  But he also didnt think that we shouldntsign the Civil Rights Act because it hasnt solved every problem.  Let's take a victory, he said,and then keep on marching.  Forward steps, large and small, were recognized for what theywere -- which was progress. Fourth, at the core of King's success was an appeal to conscience that touched hearts andopened minds, a commitment to universal ideals -- of freedom, of justice, of equality -- thatspoke to all people, not just some people.  For King understood that without broad support,any movement for civil rights could not be sustained.  That's why he marched with the whiteauto worker in Detroit.  That's why he linked arm with the Mexican farm worker in California,and united people of all colors in the noble quest for freedom. Of course, King overcame in other ways as well.  He remained strategically focused on gainingground -- his eyes on the prize constantly -- understanding that change would not be easy,understand that change wouldn't come overnight, understanding that there would be setbacksand false starts along the way, but understanding, as he said in 1956, that ""we can walk andnever get weary, because we know there is a great camp meeting in the promised land offreedom and justice."" And it's because the Moses generation overcame that the trials we face today are verydifferent from the ones that tested us in previous generations.  Even after the worst recessionin generations, life in America is not even close to being as brutal as it was back then for somany.  That's the legacy of Dr. King and his movement.  That's our inheritance.  Having saidthat, let there be no doubt the challenges of our new age are serious in their own right, andwe must face them as squarely as they faced the challenges they saw. I know it's been a hard road we've traveled this year to rescue the economy, but the economyis growing again.  The job losses have finally slowed, and around the country, there's signsthat businesses and families are beginning to rebound.  We are making progress.I know it's been a hard road that we've traveled to reach this point on health reform.  Ipromise you I know.  But under the legislation I will sign into law, insurance companies won'tbe able to drop you when you get sick, and more than 30 million people -- our fellowAmericans will finally have insurance.  More than 30 million men and women and children,mothers and fathers, won't be worried about what might happen to them if they get sick.  Thiswill be a victory not for Democrats; this will be a victory for dignity and decency, for ourcommon humanity.  This will be a victory for the United States of America. Let's work to change the political system, as imperfect as it is.  I know people can feel downabout the way things are going sometimes here in Washington.  I know it's tempting to giveup on the political process.  But we've put in place tougher rules on lobbying and ethics andtransparency -- tougher rules than any administration in history.  It's not enough, but it'sprogress.  Progress is possible.  Don't give up on voting.  Don't give up on advocacy.  Don'tgive up on activism.  There are too many needs to be met, too much work to be done.  LikeDr. King said, ""We must accept finite disappointment but never lose infinite hope."" Let us broaden our coalition, building a confederation not of liberals or conservatives, not ofred states or blue states, but of all Americans who are hurting today, and searching for abetter tomorrow.  The urgency of the hour demands that we make common cause with all ofAmerica's workers -- white, black, brown -- all of whom are being hammered by thisrecession, all of whom are yearning for that spring to come.  It demands that we reach out tothose who've been left out in the cold even when the economy is good, even when we're notin recession -- the youth in the inner cities, the youth here in Washington, D.C., people inrural communities who haven't seen prosperity reach them for a very long time.  It demandsthat we fight discrimination, whatever form it may come.  That means we fight discrimination against gays and lesbians, and we make common cause to reform our immigration system.And finally, we have to recognize, as Dr. King did, that progress can't just come from without-- it also has to come from within.  And over the past year, for example, we've mademeaningful improvements in the field of education.  I've got a terrific Secretary of Education,Arne Duncan.  He's been working hard with states and working hard with the D.C. schooldistrict, and we've insisted on reform, and we've insisted on accountability.We we're putting in more money and we've provided more Pell Grants and more tuition taxcredits and simpler financial aid forms.  We've done all that, but parents still need to parent. Kids still need to own up to their responsibilities.  We still have to set high expectations forour young people.  Folks can't simply look to government for all the answers without alsolooking inside themselves, inside their own homes, for some of the answers. Progress will only come if we're willing to promote that ethic of hard work, a sense ofresponsibility, in our own lives. I'm not talking, by the way, just to the African Americancommunity.  Sometimes when I say these things people assme, well, he's just talking to blackpeople about working hard.  No, no, no, no.  I'm talking to the American community.  Becausesomewhere along the way, we, as a nation, began to lose touch with some of our core values. You know what I'm talking about.  We became enraptured with the false prophets whoprophesized an easy path to success, paved with credit cards and home equity loans and get-rich-quick schemes, and the most important thing was to be a celebrity; it doesnt matterwhat you do, as long as you get on TV.  That's everybody. We forgot what made the bus boycott a success; what made the civil rights movement asuccess; what made the United States of America a success -- that, in this country, there's nosubstitute for hard work, no substitute for a job well done, no substitute for being responsiblestewards of God's blessings. What we're called to do, then, is rebuild America from its foundation on up.  To reinvest in theessentials that we've neglected for too long -- like health care, like education, like a betterenergy policy, like basic infrastructure, like scientific research.  Our generation is called tobuckle down and get back to basics. We must do so not only for ourselves, but also for our children, and their children.  For Jordanand for Austin.  That's a sacrifice that falls on us to make.  It's a much smaller sacrifice thanthe Moses generation had to make, but it's still a sacrifice.   Yes, it's hard to transition to a clean energy economy.  Sometimes it may be inconvenient, butit's a sacrifice that we have to make.  It's hard to be fiscally responsible when we have allthese human needs, and we're inheriting enormous deficits and debt, but that's a sacrificethat we're going to have to make.  You know, it's easy, after a hard day's work, to just putyour kid in front of the TV set -- you're tired, don't want to fuss with them -- instead ofreading to them, but that's a sacrifice we must joyfully accept.  Sometimes it's hard to be a good father and good mother. Sometimes it's hard to be a goodneighbor, or a good citizen, to give up time in service of others, to give something ofourselves to a cause that's greater than ourselves -- as Michelle and I are urging folks to dotomorrow to honor and celebrate Dr. King.  But these are sacrifices that we are called tomake.  These are sacrifices that our faith calls us to make.  Our faith in the future.  Our faithin America.  Our faith in God.And on his sermon all those years ago, Dr. King quoted a poet's verse: Truth forever on the scaffoldWrong forever on the throneAnd behind the dim unknown stands GodWithin the shadows keeping watch above his own. Even as Dr. King stood in this church, a victory in the past and uncertainty in the future, hetrusted God.  He trusted that God would make a way.  A way for prayers to be answered.  Away for our union to be perfected.  A way for the arc of the moral universe, no matter howlong, to slowly bend towards truth and bend towards freedom, to bend towards justice.  Hehad faith that God would make a way out of no way.You know, folks ask me sometimes why I look so calm. They say, all this stuff coming at you,how come you just seem calm?  And I have a confession to make here.  There are timeswhere I'm not so calm. Reggie Love knows.  My wife knows.  There are times when progressseems too slow.  There are times when the words that are spoken about me hurt.  There aretimes when the barbs sting.  There are times when it feels like all these efforts are for naught,and change is so painfully slow in coming, and I have to confront my own doubts.  But let me tell you -- during those times it's faith that keeps me calm. It's faith that gives mepeace.  The same faith that leads a single mother to work two jobs to put a roof over her headwhen she has doubts.  The same faith that keeps an unemployed father to keep on submittingjob applications even after he's been rejected a hundred times.  The same faith that says to ateacher even if the first nine children she's teaching she can't reach, that that 10th one she'sgoing to be able to reach.  The same faith that breaks the silence of an earthquake's wakewith the sound of prayers and hymns sung by a Haitian community.  A faith in things notseen, in better days ahead, in Him who holds the future in the hollow of His hand.  A faith thatlets us mount up on wings like eagles; lets us run and not be weary; lets us walk and notfaint. So let us hold fast to that faith, as Joshua held fast to the faith of his fathers, and together,we shall overcome the challenges of a new age. Together, we shall seize the promise of thismoment.  Together, we shall make a way through winter, and we're going to welcome thespring.  Through God all things are possible.May the memory of Dr. Martin Luther King continue to inspire us and ennoble our world andall who inhabit it.  And may God bless the United States of America.Thank you very much, everybody.  God bless you.",obama
"Hello, everybody! Hello, Ohio! Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Everybody, please relax. We'regoing to be here for a little bit. Everybody take a seat -- if you have a seat. It is great to see you -- caneverybody please give Jody a big round of applause for the introduction.Everybody is a special guest, but we've got a few that I just want to mention. First of all, obviously you've gotone of the finest governors in the country in Ted Strickland. Please give him a round of applause. My formercolleague when he was in the Senate -- nobody fights harder for working people than Sherrod Brown. Givehim a big round of applause.We've got a dynamo pair of members of the House of Representatives, who are so committed to theirdistricts and committed to this state -- Betty Sutton and Marcy Kaptur. I have been having just a wonderfultime here in town, and your mayor has just been a really nice person. He and I shared a burger over atSmitty's. Give Bill Grace a big round of applause.And somebody who I'm hugely impressed with because I'm just so impressed with this institution, and hisleadership obviously has been critical to it -- Dr. Ray Church, your school president here at Lorain CountyCommunity College.Well, listen, it is great to be here in Elyria. Thank you so much for the great hospitality, the wonderfulreception. Look, it's just nice being out of Washington, let me say. I mean, there are some nice people inWashington, but it can drive you crazy. Am I wrong, Sherrod?For two years, I had the privilege of traveling across this country, and I had a chance to talk to people likeyou, and go to diners and sit in barbershops, and hear directly about the challenges that all of you are facingin your lives, and the opportunities that you're taking advantage of, and all the things that we face togetheras a nation. And the single hardest thing -- people ask me this all the time -- the single hardest thing aboutbeing President is that it's harder for me to do that nowadays. It's harder to get out of the bubble.I mean, don't get me wrong, the White House is a wonderful place to work. You live above the store, whichmeans I've got a very short commute. I'm having -- I see my daughters before they go to school and I seethem at night for dinner, even if I have to go back down to the office. And that makes everything so muchbetter. But the truth is, this job is a little confining, and that is frustrating. I can't just go to the barbershop orsit in a diner. I can't always visit people directly.This is part of the reason why I've taken to the practice of reading 10 letters, out of the 40,000 that I get,every night just so that I can stay in touch and hear from you. But nothing beats a day where I can make anescape, I break out. And so I appreciate the chance to come here and spend a day.Before I came here I visited the EMC Precision Machining plant. I saw the great clean energy job trainingprogram here at Lorain County Community College. And I'm obviously thrilled to be able to spend sometime with you.Audience: We love you!Obama: I love you back. Thank you.Now, look, let's be honest. These are difficult and unsettling times. They're difficult times here in Elyria;they're tough in Ohio; they're tough all across the country. I walked into office a year ago in the middle of araging economic storm that was wreaking devastation on your town and communities everywhere. We hadto take some very difficult steps to deal with that mess, to stave off an even greater economic catastrophe.We had to stabilize the financial system, which, given the role of the big banks in creating this mess, was apretty tough pill to swallow.I knew it would be unpopular -- and rightly so. But I also knew that we had to do it because if they wentdown, your local banks would have gone down. And if the financial system went down, it would have takenthe entire economy and millions more families and businesses with it. We would have looked -- we wouldhave been looking at a second Great Depression.So in my first months in office, we also had to save two of the big three automakers from a liquidationbankruptcy, complete collapse. Some people weren't happy about that, either. I understand that. They feltlike if you're in a business, you make a bad decision, you ought to reap the consequences, just like anybusiness would. The problem was, if we let GM and Chrysler simply go under, hundreds of thousands ofAmericans would have been hurt, not just at those companies themselves, but at auto suppliers and othercompanies and dealers here in Michigan, up in -- here in Ohio, up in Michigan, all across this country.So we said, if you're willing to take some tough and painful steps to make yourself more competitive, we'rewilling to invest in your future. And earlier this week, we heard that the auto industry planned to make almost3 million cars and trucks here in North America in the next three months, which is up 69 percent from thefirst three months of last year.We also passed a Recovery Act to pull our economy back from the brink. Now, there's been a lot ofmisunderstanding about this Recovery Act. Sherrod and Marcy and Betty and I were talking about this onthe way over here. If you ask the average person, what was the Recovery Act, the stimulus package, they'dsay, ""the bank bailout."" So let me just be clear here: The Recovery Act was cutting taxes for 95 percent ofworking families -- 15 different tax cuts for working families, seven different tax cuts for small businesses sothey can start up and grow and hire. The Recovery Act was extending and increasing unemploymentinsurance and making COBRA available at a cheaper rate for people who had lost their jobs so they couldkeep their health care.We gave aid directly to states to help them through tough times. Ted can testify the help that it provided tothe Ohio budget so we wouldn't have to lay off teachers and firefighters and police officers all across thisstate. And we made the largest investment in infrastructure since the creation of the Interstate HighwaySystem, putting Americans to work rebuilding our roads, bridges, waterways -- doing the work that Americaneeds to be done.Now, today, because we took those actions, the worst of this economic storm has passed. But families likeyours and communities like this one are still reeling from the devastation it left in its wake. At one of thecompanies, at EMC, where I went today -- wonderful company, passed on through generations -- they havehung on with their precision manufacturing, high value added. They can do things that can't be shipped offto China because they're so attuned to their customers' needs. But they had 77 employees; now they've got44. They want to start hiring back, but it's going to take a little time. The good news is they're starting to seeorders pick up just a little bit.But it's tough. Folks have seen jobs you thought would last forever disappear. You've seen plants close andbusinesses shut down. I've heard about how the city government here is starting to cut into bone, not justfat. You can't get to work or go buy groceries like you used to because of cuts in the county transit system.And this all comes after one of the toughest decades our middle class has faced in generations. I mean,think about what's happened over the last 10 years, even before the crisis hit. This is a decade where somefolks made tons of money, but so many others were just pedaling faster and faster, but they were stuck inthe same place, sometimes slipping behind. The average wage, the average income over the last decadeactually flat-lined; in some cases went down. That was before the crisis.So, for many of you, even as you found your paychecks shrinking, even as after the crisis you found thevalue of your biggest asset, your home, falling, the cost of everything else has gone up: the cost ofgroceries, the cost of sending your kids to college, costs of retirement. And you've also faced the breakneck,unrelenting climb of costs for your health care needs.Now, here's the message I want you to take away -- and we're going to have a lot of time for questions, but Iwant to make this absolutely clear. I did not run for President to turn away from these challenges. I didn't runto kick these challenges down the road. I ran for President to confront them -- once and for all.I ran for this office to rebuild our economy so it works not just for the fortunate few, but for everybody who'swilling to work hard in this country to create good jobs that can support a family; to get wages growing andincomes rising; to improve the quality of America's schools and lift up great community colleges like this oneso that people are constantly learning, constantly retraining for the jobs of the 21st century; to make highereducation affordable for the children of working families -- and, yes, to deal with the problem of runawayhealth insurance costs that are breaking family budgets and breaking business budgets and breaking ournational budgets.Now, since this has been in the news a little bit this week, let me say a little something about health care. Ihad no illusions when I took this on that this was going to be hard. Seven Presidents had tried it, sevenCongresses had tried it -- and all of them had failed.And I had a whole bunch of political advisors telling me this may not be the smartest thing to do. ""You've gota lot on your plate: the biggest economic crisis since the Great Depression; two wars. You may not get a lotof cooperation. you're going to have a lot of pushback from the insurance companies and the drugcompanies. It's complicated. Don't do it.""Now, let me tell you why I did it. I knew that insurance premiums had more than doubled in the past decade.I knew that out-of-pocket expenses had skyrocketed. I knew that millions more people had lost theirinsurance, and I knew that because of that economic crisis that was only going to get worse. When you lose7 million jobs, like we lost over the last two years, what do you think happens to those folks' healthinsurance? What happens when their COBRA runs out?I took this up because I wanted to ease the burdens on all the families and small businesses that can'tafford to pay outrageous rates. And I wanted to protect mothers and fathers and children by being targetedby some of the worst practices of the insurance industry that I had heard time and time again as I traveledthrough this country.Now, let me dispel this notion that somehow we were focused on that, and so, as a consequence, notfocused on the economy. First of all, all I think about is how we're going to create jobs in this area. All I thinkabout is how do we get banks lending again. I've been doing that the entire year. So have folks like Sherrodand Marcy and Betty. But what I also know is, is that health care is part of the drag on our economy. It's partof the eroding security that middle-class families feel.So here's the good news: We've gotten pretty far down the road. But I've got to admit, we had a little bit of abuzz saw this week.Now, I also know that part of the reason is, is that this process was so long and so drawn out -- this is justwhat happens in Congress. I mean, it's just an ugly process. You're running headlong into special interests,and armies of lobbyists, and partisan politics that's aimed at exploiting fears instead of getting things done.And then you've got ads that are scaring the bejesus out of everybody. And the longer it take, the uglier itlooks.So I understand why people would say, boy, this is -- I'm not so sure about this -- even though they knowthat what they got isn't working. And I understand why, after the Massachusetts election, people inWashington were all in a tizzy, trying to figure out what this means for health reform, Republicans and Democrats; what does it mean for Obama? Is he weakened? Is he -- oh, how's he going to survive this?That's what they do.But I want you -- I want you to understand, this is not about me. This is not about me. This is about you. Thisis not about me; this is about you. I didn't take this up to boost my poll numbers. You know the way to boostyour poll numbers is not do anything. That's how you do it. You don't offend anybody. I'd have real high pollnumbers. All of Washington would be saying, ""What a genius!"" I didn't take this on to score political points. I know there are some folks who think if Obama loses, we win.But you know what? I think that I win when you win. That's how I think about it.So if I was trying to take the path of least resistance, I would have done something a lot easier. But I'mtrying to solve the problems that folks here in Ohio and across this country face every day. And I'm notgoing to walk away just because it's hard. We are going to keep on working to get this done -- withDemocrats, I hope with Republicans -- anybody who's willing to step up. Because I'm not going to watchmore people get crushed by costs or denied care they need by insurance company bureaucrats. I'm notgoing to have insurance companies click their heels and watch their stocks skyrocket because once againthere's no control on what they do.So long as I have some breath in me, so long as I have the privilege of serving as your President, I will notstop fighting for you. I will take my lumps, but I won't stop fighting to bring back jobs here. I won't stopfighting for an economy where hard work is rewarded. I won't stop fighting to make sure there'saccountability in our financial system.I'm not going to stop fighting until we have jobs for everybody.That's why I'm calling on Congress to pass a jobs bill to put more Americans to work building off ourRecovery Act; put more Americans back to work rebuilding roads and railways; provide tax breaks to smallbusinesses for hiring people; offer families incentives to make their homes more energy-efficient, savingthem money while creating jobs.That's why we enacted initiatives that are beginning to give rise to a clean energy economy. That's part ofwhat's going on in this community college. If we hadn't done anything with the Recovery Act, talk to thepeople who are building wind turbines and solar panels. They would have told you their industry was aboutto collapse because credit had completely frozen. And now you're seeing all across Ohio some of the -- thisstate has received more funds than just about anybody in order to build on that clean energy economy --new cutting-edge wind turbines and batteries that are going to be going into energy-efficient cars.Almost $25 million of our investment went to a plant right here in Elyria that's helping produce the carbatteries of the future. That's what we're going to keep on doing for the rest of 2010 and 2011 and 2012,until we've got this country working again.So long as I'm President, I'll never stop fighting for policies that will help restore home values, to redeem theinvestment that folks have made. We've seen some of those values return in some places, in some pockets,but it's still tough out there. We're going to have to do more this year to make sure that banks areresponsive to folks who are working hard, have been paying their mortgage, but have found themselves in atough situation.I'm not going to stop fighting to give our kids the best education possible to take the tens of billions of dollarswe pay banks to act as middlemen on student loans and invest that money in students who actually need it.We don't need the middlemen -- cut them out.I won't stop fighting to give every American a fair shake. That's why the very first bill I signed into law wasthe Lilly Ledbetter Act to uphold the principle of equal pay for equal work for men and women alike,especially when families need two paychecks to survive.So long as I'm President, I won't stop fighting to protect you from the kinds of deceptive practices we'veseen from some in the financial sector. That's why I signed a Credit Card Bill of Rights into law, to protectyou from surprise charges and retroactive rate hikes and other unfair rules. That's why I'm fighting for atough consumer financial protection agency to protect you against those hidden overdraft fees that canmake a single ATM withdrawal cost 30 bucks. That happened to you, didn't it?I won't stop fighting to open up government. Now, this is hard to do because we don't control every branch.But I can tell you we have put in place the toughest ethics laws and toughest transparency rules of anyAdministration in history. In history.By the way, this is the first Administration since the founding of the country where all of you can find out whovisits the White House. First time in history. And that's just one example of how we're trying to constantlyopen the process.And so long as I'm President, I won't stop fighting to cut waste and abuse in Washington -- to eliminate whatwe don't need, to pay for what we do; to rein in exploding deficits that we've been accumulating not just lastyear but for the last 10.And I'm going to keep on fighting for real, meaningful health insurance reform. We expanded the Children'sHealth Insurance Program to include four million kids -- we already did that. But we are also going to fight tohold the insurance industry accountable, to bring more stability and security to folks who are in our healthcare system. And, yes, I want to make sure that people who don't have health care right now can get some.It's shameful that we don't do that.Now, these are some of the fights we've already had, and I can promise you there will be more fights ahead.I'm not going to win every round. We're having a fight right now because I want to charge Wall Street amodest fee to repay taxpayers in full for saving their skins in a time of need. We want our money back. Wewant our money back. And we're going to get your money back, every dime -- each and every dime.But it's going to be a fight. You watch. I guarantee you when we start on financial regulatory reform, trying tochange the rules to prevent what has caused so much heartache all across the country, there are peoplewho are going to say, ""Why is he meddling in government?"" ""Why is meddling in the financial industry?"" ""It'sanother example of Obama being big government.""No, I just want to have some rules in place so that when these guys make dumb decisions, you don't end uphaving to foot the bill. That's pretty straightforward. I don't mind having that fight.You know, I said at the beginning how much it means to me to be able to travel this country, and how muchit means for me to be here. And that is true now more than ever, because there's no doubt that it's easy toget a pretty warped view of things in Washington. But then you start talking to the guys working on thosemachines, creating products all across the country, you go into the diner and you meet folks who are raisingtheir kids and working hard and trying to keep things together, and I'm reminded of the strength and theresilience and the perseverance of the American people. I'm reminded of the fundamental character of theAmericans that I'm so privileged to serve.It's that character that has borne our nation through the roughest of seas, a lot rougher than the ones we'regoing through right now. That's the character that will carry us through this storm to better days ahead. I amconfident of that, because of you. And I'm very grateful for all of you taking the time to be here today.Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you.All right, this young lady right back here.  Yes, you.  There should be a microphone -- wait till the mic comesso everybody can hear you.  Oh, I'm sorry -- that's okay, I'll call on you next.  Well, one of you ask yourquestion.Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  It's an honor to be here with you today.  I work here in LCCC'sfinancial services office. I am proud to be part of finding pathways for students who attend college.  I feelthat a college education is a lifeline to the future of our citizens.  We greatly appreciate the increase in thePell Grant, which allowed our neediest students to access a college education.  It increased buying poweras  college costs continue to rise.  My question to you is, will your Administration support continuedincreases to the Pell Grant so that our neediest students have access to higher education?President Obama:  The answer is yes.  I want everybody to understand, we made -- and this was the help -- with the help of the members of Congress who are here -- made an enormous investment in highereducation, making sure that young people could afford to go to great institutions like this.  So wesignificantly increased the level of each Pell Grant, and we also put more money so that we could havemore Pell Grants.Now, we want to continue to do this.  I mentioned during my formal remarks the fact that a lot of banks andfinancial institutions are still serving as middlemen in the financial aid process, and they take out severalbillions dollars' worth of profits from that.  It turns out that actually it can be administered in such a waywhere these loans go directly to the students.  And if you do that, then you're saving several billion dollarsthat can then be put back into the system.  We want to get that finalized; we want to get that done.  That willbe an enormous boost.Now, one thing I have to say, though.  Even as we put more money into the Student Loan Program, we arealso trying to reach out to university presidents and administrators to figure out how can we reduce theinflation in higher education -- because the fact is, is that the only thing that has gone up faster in cost thanhealth care is -- guess what.  Higher education.  And the problem is, if we're not thinking about ways tocurve the inflation, then even if we put more money in, what that money is buying becomes less and less. And so trying to find creative ways for universities to do more with less is going to be important.Now, in fairness to universities and colleges, part of the reason they've been having to jack up their costs isthey used to get more support from the state.  State budgets got into a hole, and then it became harder, andso they had to make it up on the tuition side.  Nevertheless, what is also true, though, is just their generalcosts of operating have gone up in ways that I think we can improve.  So we're going to be working on thatas well.All right?  Okay, I've got to call a gentleman, then I got to go back to you because you thought that I calledyou and I feel bad. All right.  This gentleman right here in the tie.  Yes, you look sharp.Question:  Mr. President, thank you.  It's an honor to stand before you.  Thank you.  Earlier in yourmessage, you mentioned our transit system.  Obviously we do need help and we're in dire need to havesome assistance there.  But what I didn't hear in anything is your interest in our steel mill.  That's a big partof our community and we desperately need help there as well.  We just wondered where Washington'sstance is on our steel mill.  Thank you.President Obama:  Well, I was talking to your mayor about this.  Obviously he's a big advocate formanufacturing in the region.  I do not have all the details in terms of what's happening at the steel mill at thismoment.  But what we've done is we've set up an office in the White House just focused on manufacturing --because it's my view that America's got to make things.Now, we're not going to make -- I want to be honest.  Not all the manufacturing jobs that have gone aregoing to come back.  And if people tell you they are, that's just not true -- because a lot of that has moved toplaces where the wages are just much lower.  And I know that some people say, well, then we should justset up tariffs so that folks can't ship them in.  But these days the economy, the global economy is sointerconnected that that's just not a practical solution.The solution is to find -- and I don't Know the details of the steel mill here -- but I know that the ones thathave been successful, they do what EMC is doing as well, which is you find what's the high-end market. What's the market that involves a lot of technology, specialization, highly trained workers, quick turnaroundsto spec so that the customers really feel like they're getting something special and different -- that's how youcompete, because that's something that a steel mill in China or in Brazil can't do.  They can't compete withyou being on the spot working closely with customers.So finding ways to develop specialty steels and so forth, that's going to be the key.  Our manufacturingoffice will be working with folks here in town to see what we can do.All right?  Thank you.  All right, back to this young lady here.Question:   First I want to start by saying that I am very grateful to be here to meet you in person.  Iabsolutely support you and back you.  I feel like Rome wasn't built in a day, and I know that everybody isreally impatient, but I know that with time things can be turned around.  And I believe that your intentions arereally honorable in that.President Obama:  I appreciate it.Question:  I am a single mother of three, and I have two quick issues that are very important to me -- onebeing that I have a three-year-old, who has just turned three, who got lead poisoning last year and almostdied.  And I called everyone, including the EPA of Ohio, and I cannot seem to get any response to this.President Obama:  Well, guess what.  I guarantee you that somebody from the EPA is going to call you inabout -- in about five minutes.  Before you sit down, there's going to be a phone call from the EPA.All joking aside -- and I know you have a second question, but I just want to focus on this -- lead poisoning,a lot of it from lead paint, from older homes all across the country and all across the Midwest is somethingthat we have to be more aggressive on.  This is something that I worked on when I was a U.S. senator,when I was a state senator.  I'm working on it as President, and I will find out directly from them how theycan help not only with your particular situation but what we're doing in this area in terms of lead abatement.Question:  Okay.President Obama:  Okay?Question:  The second thing that I wanted to address to you is the unfair labor laws that they seem to havein some of these industries as far as discrimination and different issues of that nature that don't seem to getaddressed from the bigger companies.  I have actually worked for Ford -- I'm a full-time student now here atLC, gratefully -- and even when I was working there and I have -- my whole family has actually come upthrough Ford -- and there's a lot of very unjust situations that come about, but no attorneys will deal with it,no one will talk about it, and it's always pushed under the rug.  And I -- I do owe my -- what I have now toFord because it was what was bread and butter for my family.  But at the same time, it's not fair that even atthis point my mother still can't retire, she has to continue to suffer.President Obama:  Well, look, let me just say generally, one of the things that my Administration has beenable to do over the last year that does not cost money is just enforcing laws that are on the books a littlemore aggressively, making sure -- I mentioned earlier equal pay for equal work. We are so past the point where it should be debatable that women get paid the same as men for doing thesame job.  And it is something that -- especially because there was a -- it was just released I think last weekshowing that increasingly the wives are making more than the husbands in some circumstances.  Andwhoever is making more, you've got to have two paychecks.  So this is not just a ""feminist issue"" -- youknow, sometimes guys say, well, why do I -- why should I care about it?  Well, let me tell you something.  Ifyour wife is getting paid fairly, that means your family is getting paid fairly.  And I want my daughters to betreated the same way as your sons.  That's something we shouldn't be arguing about anymore.All right, gentleman right back here.  Yes, it's a guy's turn.  Yes, sir.Question:  I'm an inventor, and I hold U.S. patent number 7,397,731.President Obama:  Okay.Question:  And before I ask my question I'd like to make a sales pitch.  If you can use my patent in yournext election, I think you can raise a ton of money worldwide.  You should take a look at it.President Obama:  All right, we'll take a look.  All right.Question:  If you can't use it, the government could use it, and I could build a multibillion-dollar businesshere in Ohio.President Obama:  All right, we'll take a look at your patent.  Go ahead, what's your question?Question:  Yes, okay, it has to do with international patent rights.  With all this free trade and trade barriersfalling, it's really hard for an individual like me with a global-scope patent to file all over the world and getpatent protection everywhere, and having to go overseas to fight infringement.  So if you're going to droptrade barriers, maybe you can extend my patent rights to the foreign countries.President Obama:  Well, this is a great question, and this is a huge problem.  Look, our competitiveadvantage in the world is going to be people like this who are using their minds to create new products, newservices.  But that only helps us and helps you build a multibillion-dollar company if somebody can't juststeal that idea and suddenly start making it in Indonesia or Malaysia or Bangladesh with very cheapworkers. And one of the problems that we have had is insufficient protection for intellectual property rights.  That'strue in China; it's true for everything from bootleg DVDs to very sophisticated software.  And there's nothingwrong with other people using our technologies.  We just want to make sure that it's licensed and you'regetting paid.So I've given instructions to my trade offices -- and we actually highlight this at the highest levels of foreignpolicy -- that these are issues that have to be addressed because that's part of the reciprocity of making ourmarkets open.  And so when I met with President Hu of China, this is a topic that, at dinner, I directlybrought up with him.  And -- But as you point out, it's got to be sustained, because a lot of times they'll say,yes, yes, yes, but then there's no enforcement on their end.And one of the things that we're also doing is using our export arm of the U.S. government to help work withmedium-sized businesses and small businesses, not just the big multinationals to protect their rights insome of these areas, because we need to boost exports. Can I just say, we just went through a decade where we were told that it didn't matter, we'll just -- you justkeep on importing, buying stuff from other countries, you just take out a home equity loan and max out yourcredit card, and everything is going to be okay.  And it looked, for a lot of people, like, well, the economyseems to be growing -- but it was all built on a house of cards.  That's what we now know.  And that's why ifwe're going to have a successful manufacturing sector, we've got to have successful exports.When I went and took this trip to China, and took this trip to Asia, a lot of people said, ""Well, why is he goingto Asia?  He's traveling overseas too much.  He needs to be coming back home and talking about jobs.""  I'mthere because that's where we're going to find those jobs, is by increasing our exports to those countries,the same way they've been doing in our country. If we increased our exports -- our share of exports by just 1percent, that would mean hundreds of thousands of jobs here in the United States.  Five percent -- maybe amillion jobs, well-paying jobs.  So we're going to have to pry those markets open.  Intellectual property ispart of that process.All right, great question.It's a woman's turn now.  You guys just put down your hands.  Oh, okay, well, this young lady right in front. We've got a microphone over here.  You know, I would give it to you if I could reach, but -- go ahead.Question:  I introduce myself.  I'm 83 years old.  I know I don't look it.President Obama:  You don't.  You don't.  You look great.Question:  Thank you.  I'm very concerned about Social Security.  I think there's a few here who areprobably living on that or supplementing that.  I understand that Congress has given themselves a raise buthas denied us COLA for possibly the next three years.  At the time of the H1N1 thing, people over 65 werenot given the right to have the shot.  For some reason or other this health care crisis was left on our seniorbacks.  What can we do about this?President Obama:  Well, let me address all three of your issues, because you're raising actually threeseparate issues. First is how do we make sure that Social Security is sustainable over the long term.  Social Security is oneof our entitlement programs that for now is stable, but will not be if we don't make some changes.  Now,here's the good news.  Compared to Medicare, Social Security is actually in reasonably good shape, andwith some relatively small adjustments, you can have that solvent for a long time.  So Social Security isgoing to be there.  I know a lot of people are concerned about it.  Social Security we can fix.Now, in terms of the COLA, the formula -- COLA stands for Cost of Living Allowance, so it's put in place tomake sure that Social Security is keeping up with inflation.  Here's the problem.  This past year, because ofthe severity of the recession, we didn't have inflation; we actually had deflation.  So prices actually fell lastyear.  As a consequence, technically, seniors were not eligible for a Cost of Living Adjustment, to have it goup because prices did not go up in the aggregate.  That doesn't mean that individual folks weren't beingpinched by higher heating prices or what have you, but on average prices went down.Here's what we did.  Working with these key members of Congress here, we did vote to provide a $250 one-time payment to seniors, which, when you factored it in, amounted to about 1.8 percent.  So it was almostthe equivalent of the COLA, even though it wasn't actually the COLA.So we didn't forget seniors.  We never forget seniors because they vote at very high rates.  Not to mentionyou changed our diapers and things.  And so we appreciate that.The third point that you made had to do with the H1N1 virus. The reason that seniors were not prioritizedwas because, unlike the seasonal flu shot, H1N1 was deadliest in young people and particularly children. And because the virus came up fairly late in the time frame for preparing flu shots, we had a limited numberof vaccines, and we had to decide who gets the vaccines first. Now, by the way, let me just do a little PSA here.  Anybody who has not gotten a H1N1 shot, along with theirseasonal flu, I would still advise you to get it, because historically there are two waves of this.  Particularlymake sure your kids have gotten it, because there have been a significantly higher number of children killedunder H1 -- who get H1N1 than those who just get the seasonal flu.  It's still a small fraction, I don't want tomake everybody afraid.  But it's just -- it's a little more serious than the normal seasonal flu.So it's not that seniors were neglected here.  What happened was, according to the science, according tothe CDC, it was determined that we had to go to the most vulnerable groups the quickest, and that waschildren, particularly those who had underlying neurological disorders or immunity disorders. All right?  We haven't forgotten about you.  And you don't look 83.Okay.  This young man -- he's been standing up quite a long time.  There you go.Question:  Mr. President, my name is Jordan Brown.  Can you hear me?President Obama:  Yes.Question:  Okay.President Obama:  Go ahead and give him the mic.  I don't want to have him fall over there.Question:   Okay.  I don't have a question but I do want to know if I would like -- if I can shake your hand.  President Obama:  Well, yes, yes, you'll be able to come up here.  If somebody lets you through, I'lldefinitely give you a handshake.  All right, who -- I want to make sure -- you know, there's another youngman here so I'll call on him.Question:  I'm 29 years old, and I've never had a job in my life. I went to jail when I was younger.  It's likehard to get a job as a felon.  Is this -- any programs that hire people with felonies like something that --because it's sad, it's like -- 29 years old, I'm 29.President Obama:  All right.  Jerome --Question:  And also I wanted to -- I'm a poet and I wrote a poem for you and I've been dying to put thispoem in your hand.President Obama:  Okay.  Give me the poem.  First of all, it's never too late.  It's never too late.  One ofthese gentlemen here will hand this poem to me.  There you go.  I won't read it from the stage but --because it's --Question:  I'd appreciate it, later when you get back to the White House.President Obama:  But I will definitely think about it. Look, I'm proud of the fact that you're bringing this up because there are people who've made mistakes,particularly when they're young, and it is in all of our interests to help them redeem themselves and then geton a straight path.  Now, I don't blame employers obviously for being nervous about hiring somebody whohas a record.  It's natural if they've got a lot of applicants for every single job that that's a question thatthey'd have in their minds.  On the other hand, I think one of the great things about America is we givepeople second chances.And so what we've tried to do -- and I want to say, this has been a bipartisan effort -- when I was in theSenate, working with Sam Brownback; my Vice President, Joe Biden -- passing a Second Chance Act thathelps to fund programs that help the reintegration of ex-felons. It's smart for us to do.  You know, sometimespeople say, well, that's just coddling people.  No; you reduce the recidivism rate, they pay taxes, it ends upbeing smart for taxpayers to do. I don't know, Jerome, what particular programs may exist in this county, butI promise you I'll find out.  And we'll see if we can get you hooked up with one of them.  All right?Okay, right here.  Yes.  No, no, no.  Right here.  Yes.  Go ahead.Question:  Mr. President, I started a Great Lakes Truck Driving School in 2008 in Lorain County.President Obama:  I'm sorry, what kind of school?Question:  Great Lakes Truck Driving School.President Obama:  Cross driving school?  Oh, truck driving school, I'm sorry.Question:  Great Lakes Truck Driving School.  Started in 2008.  Our first year we trained 287 people andwe placed over 70 percent of those people into jobs.  At that time there was enough money, through theWorkforce Investment Board, to train those people.  In the past few months we've had a number of peopleon a daily basis coming into our school that's unemployed, but there are no training funds for truck drivertraining.  And I want to know why that has changed.President Obama:  Well, the Recovery Act put a huge amount of money into retraining.  We are nowpreparing for next year's budget, and I know that we have actually allocated additional money for retraining.I don't know specifically what's happening that would cause those dollars to dry up with respect to a truckdriving school.  Let me see if I can find out.  I'll have one of my staff get your card, and maybe we canprovide you some information.Question:  Thank you very much.President Obama:  Here's the broader point, though.  The story of retraining has become so important. When I went to EMC, the precision tool-making place, there were a group of guys -- and one guy who said Ishould call him ""Jerry the Mechanic.""  He shakes my hand, and he and his buddy are talking to me.  I said,""How long have you been working here?""  They said, ""Twenty years.""  And I'd noticed that a lot of theequipment now is all digital and fancy, compared to the old machines on the other side of the building.  Isaid, ""Well, did you guys have to get additional training for this?""  And they said, ""Well, you know whathappened was, we used to work in this old plant, and we got laid off.  We came here to Lorain CommunityCollege and took a six-month, 12-hour-a-day course that completely retrained us, and that's what got usthese new jobs, and we've been working for over a decade now at these new jobs.""Now, here's the thing.  These guys were -- these guys -- first of all, they weren't plants, as far as I know --unless the mayor is a lot slicker than I think.  But these guys did point out that it was JTPA funds -- jobtraining funds that the federal government and the state and local all work together to make sure that peoplehave access to funds.  They also said, though, during that time they were still working eight hours a daybecause they had found sort of lower-paying jobs just to pay the rent while they were getting retrained.  Isaid, ""Okay, so you've been working eight hours and going to class 12 hours?""  ""Yes.""  I said, ""Well, whendo you sleep?""  ""Well, in between class and taking the shift."" They did this for six months.  I tell this story, one, to emphasize how important the college system is inmaking our workforce prepared for the 21st century.  I make the point because, number two, it only works ifthe government is providing some help for people to finance their educations, their retraining.But point number three is, even if you've got a great community college, you've got the financing, you'vealso got to want it.  You've also got to want it.  Think about these guys -- you work eight hours, you go toclass 12 hours, you're working -- you're sleeping in between, doing that for six months.  But because theywere hungry and they had confidence about their ability to translate their old skills into new skills, they'vehad steady jobs ever since that allow them to support their families.Now, that's the partnership between the government, the free market, businesses, individuals -- that's whatwe're trying to forge.  And that's why I get so frustrated when we have these ideological debates inWashington where people start saying how, ""Oh, Obama is just trying to perpetrate big government.""  Whatbig government exactly have we been trying to perpetrate here?  We're trying to fund those guys who wantto go to truck driving school.  We want to make sure that they've got some money to get trained for a job inthe private sector. When we passed the Recovery Act, these aren't all a bunch of government jobs.  These are jobs thatprivate contractors contract with the state or the city or the county to build roads and highways, the sameway that we built the Interstate Highway System and the Intercontinental Railroad System. I mean, I understand how people have become mistrustful of government.  We don't need big government;we need smart government -- that works and interacts with the private sector to create opportunity forordinary people.  But it can't be this constant ideological argument.  People need help.  We need to providethem a helping hand.  That's what we stand for.All right.  I've got time for only, unfortunately, one more question.  I've been having a great time.  But it is aman's turn here.  All right.  Is that you, Joe?  Well, this is a ringer.  I'm going to talk -- I'll talk to youseparately.  This is a friend of mine.  People will say, ah, he called on a friend of his.  I'll talk to you over tothe side here.Go ahead, this gentleman right here.Question:   Thank you for taking my question.  Thank you for coming here.  I'm a 52-year-old businessmanfrom Akron, Ohio.  I want to create 1,200 jobs.  I spend $60,000 of my own money to do a due diligence,travel to China with a German-designed turbine, and they're producing it now in China.  I have rights toNorth America, primarily the Great Lakes.Two things that I'm challenged by -- I'm having a very difficult time raising money.  I'm not asking for ahandout.  All I'm asking is loan me the money; I'll account for it, every dollar, I'll pay it back.Secondly -- and I'm willing to risk millions -- 99 percent of my net worth.  The second thing is that GE has apatent -- and I believe in patents.  I listened to this gentleman back here, and I can truly appreciate whathe's going through.  But in this instance, GE inherited this patent from Enron, and it's created a wall so thatthey won't let people come in and build turbines in the United States.  Now, the patent is going to expirevery soon. But now they're calling it a royalty but it's really a gate to keep people out. Is there any programs -- I've talked to Governor Strickland, I've talked to Sherrod Brown, I've talked to LeeFisher.  This company was identified by the city of Akron and Donald Plusquellic's visionary leadershipdown in Akron.  But I want to bring this to the United States.  I want to bring these jobs -- and this not aboutmoney for me.  This is about creating jobs.I can feel for that gentleman that wants to work.  He should have a right to work.  God bless him.President Obama:  Let me respond -- first of all --Question:  Is there any -- is there any federal programs that can help me -- I just want to borrow the moneyto create this factory and create these jobs.President Obama:  Well, obviously I don't know about the particular situation so I'll just speak generally toit.  And if you want to get one of my team your card, then maybe they can follow up with you. But one of the things that we've done -- or one of the things that we've seen coming out of the financial crisisis that banks are still not lending to small businesses enough.  The mayor and I talked about this.  Thebusiness owners that I talked to will confirm this.  And if you ask why -- if you ask the banks why, they'll say,well, it's a combination of, in some cases, demand really is down; businesses don't have as manycustomers as they used to so revenues are down and -- so they don't want to lend.  That's some cases.  Butin some cases what you've got is very profitable businesses that are ready to go, ready to invest, got aproven track record -- the banks feel as if regulators are looking over their shoulder and discouraging themfrom lending.So what I've said to Treasury Secretary Geithner and others is we can't meddle with independent regulators-- their job is to stay apart from politics and make sure the banking system is sound -- but there should be adiscussion about whether or not we have seen the pendulum swing too far, where it used to be they'd justlend anybody anything; then they lost all this money and now they won't lend people with good creditanything.  That is not good for the economy. So what we've tried to do is to fill some of these gaps in the meantime.  For example, our small businesslending through the SBA has actually gone up 70 percent.  And we've been waiving fees, increasingguarantees, and what we're trying to do is streamline the process for SBA loans because right now there'sjust too much paperwork.  It's typical government not having caught up with the 21st century.  And you can'thave a 50-pound application form.  People just -- after a while, it's not worth it, in some cases.  So we'retrying to do all those things.Now, with respect to patents, again, I don't know the particular situation.  I will say this.  It's important thatwe protect internationally intellectual property.  It is also important though that we have a patent system thatencourages innovation but doesn't just lock in big monopolies that prevent new people from bringing newproducts into the system.The worst offender of this problem is actually the drug companies, because they will try to lock in theirpatents for as long as they can to prevent generics from coming onto the market, and that costs customersbillions of dollars.  And sometimes the drug company will redesign it so it's a caplet instead of a pill, andthen try to get a new patent, to get another seven or nine or 10 years of coverage.  That is something thatwe've got to change.  I don't know whether that applies to your particular situation, but we have to have apatent system that doesn't prevent competition.  We want a patent system that encourages innovation.Now, I'm out of time, but I want to say one last thing.  First of all, because there's been so much attentionfocused on this health care issue this week, I just want to emphasize not the myths but the reality of what istrying to -- that both the House and the Senate bill were trying to accomplish, because it's actually verysimple.  There are a bunch of provisions in it, but it's pretty simple.Number one, for those of you who have health insurance, we are trying to get in place reforms that makesure you are getting your money's worth for the insurance that you pay for.  That means, for example, thatthey can't impose a lifetime cap where if you really get sick and suddenly there's some fine print in there thatsays you're not completely covered.  We're trying to make sure that there is a cap on out-of-pocketexpenses so that you don't find out, when you read the fine print, that you've got to pay a huge amount thatyou thought you were covered for.  We're trying to make sure that if you've got a preexisting condition, youcan actually still get health insurance, because a lot of people have been banned from getting healthinsurance because of a preexisting condition.One of the provisions -- one of the reforms we want is to make sure that your 26- or 27-year-old could, upuntil that age, could stay on your insurance, so that once they get out of high school and college, they canstay on their parents' insurance for a few years until they've got a more stable job. So you've got all these insurance reforms that we're trying to get passed.  Now, some people ask, well, whydon't you just pass that and forget everything else?  Here's the problem.  Let's just take the example ofpreexisting conditions.  We can't prohibit insurance companies from preventing people with preexistingconditions getting insurance unless everybody essentially has insurance.  And the reason for that isotherwise what would happen is people would just -- just wouldn't get insurance until they were sick andthen they'd go and buy insurance and they couldn't be prohibited.  And that would drive everybody else'spremiums up.So a lot of these insurance reforms are connected to some other things we have to do to make sure thateverybody has some access to coverage.  All right? So the second thing we've been trying to do is to make sure that we're setting up an exchange, which is justa big pool so that people who are individuals, who are self employed, who are small business owners, theycan essentially join a big pool of millions of people all across the country, which means that when you go tonegotiate with your insurance company you've got the purchasing power of a Ford or a GM or Wal-Mart or aXerox or the federal employees.  That's why federal employees have good insurance, and countyemployees and state employees have good insurance, in part is because they're part of this big pool.And our attitude is, can we make sure that everybody is part of a big pool to drive down costs.  That's thesecond thing we're trying to do.Third thing we're trying to do is to try to reduce costs overall because the system -- how many of you, you gointo the doctor's office, you fill out a form, you get a checkup, you go fill out another form, somebody elseasks you for the form you just filled out.  Then the doctor fills out a form, you got to take it to the pharmacist. The pharmacist can't read the doctor's -- this is the only industry in the country that still does that, that stilloperates on paper systems, that still orders all kinds of unnecessary tests. Because a lot of times, I walk in the doctor, I just do what I'm told -- I don't know what he's doing.  I don'tknow whether this test was necessary or whether we could have had the test that I took six months ago e-mailed to the doctor so I wouldn't have to take another test and pay for another test.  Right?  So there are allthese methods of trying to reduce costs.  And that's what we've been trying to institute.Now, I just want to say, as I said in my opening remarks, the process has been less than pretty.  When youdeal with 535 members of Congress, it's going to be a somewhat ugly process -- not necessarily becauseany individual member of Congress is trying to do something wrong, it's just they may have different ideas,they have different interests, they've got a particular issue of a hospital in their district that they want to seeif they can kind of get dealt with and this may be the best vehicle for doing it.  They're looking out for theirconstituents a lot of times.But when you put it all together, it starts looking like just this monstrosity.  And it makes people fearful.  Andit makes people afraid.  And they start thinking, you know what, this looks like something that is going tocost me tax dollars and I already have insurance so why should I support this.So I just want to be clear that there are things that have to get done.  This is our best chance to do it.  Wecan't keep on putting this off.  Even if you've got health insurance right now, look at what's happening withyour premiums and look at the trend.  It is going to gobble up more and more of your paycheck. Ask a chunkof you folks in here who have seen your employers say you've got to pick up more of your payments interms of higher deductibles or higher copayments.  Some of you, your employers just said, we can't affordhealth insurance at all.  That's going to happen to more and more people.You asked about Social Security.  Let me talk about Medicare.  Medicare will be broke in eight years if wedo nothing.  Right now we give -- we give about $17 billion in subsidies to insurance companies through theMedicare system -- your tax dollars.  But when we tried to eliminate them, suddenly there were ads on TV --""Oh, Obama is trying to cut Medicare.""  I get all these seniors writing letters:  ""Why are you trying to cut myMedicare benefits?""  I'm not trying to cut your Medicare benefits.  I'm trying to stop paying these insurancecompanies all this money so I can give you a more stable program.The point is this:  None of the big issues that we face in this country are simple.  Everybody wants to act likethey're simple.  Everybody wants to say that they can be done easily.  But they're complicated.  They'retough.  The health care system is a big, complicated system, and doing it right is hard. Energy.  If we want to be energy independent -- I'm for more oil production.  I am for -- I am for new forms ofenergy.  I'm for a safe nuclear industry.  I'm not ideological about this.  But we also have to acknowledgethat if we're going to actually have a energy-independent economy, that we've got to make some changes. We can't just keep on doing business the same way.  And that's going to be a big, complicated discussion. We can't shy away from it, though.  We can't sort of start suddenly saying to ourselves, America orCongress can't do big things; that we should only do the things that are non-controversial; we should onlydo the stuff that's safe.  Because if that's what happens, then we're not going to meet the challenges of the21st century.  And that's not who we are.  That's not how we used to operate, and that's not how I intend usto operate going forward. We are going to take these big things on, and I'm going to do it, and you're going to do it, because you knowthat we want to leave a better America for our children and our grandchildren. And that doesn't meanstanding still; that means marching forward.I want to march forward with you.  I want to work with you. I want to fight for you.  I hope you're willing tostand by me, even during these tough times, because I believe in a brighter future for America.Thank you, everybody.  God bless you.",obama

"Good morning. And thank you to everyone who worked to bring us to this day, especially theInternational Auschwitz Council and the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum.To President Kacynski, Prime Minister Tusk, and to the people of Poland: Thank you forpreserving a place of such great pain for the Polish people, but a place of remembrance andlearning for the world.Although I cant be with you in person, I am proud that the United States is represented theretoday by a delegation of distinguished Americans, including Ambassador Feinstein; my wifeMichelles chief of staff, Susan Sher; and my good friend, and the son of Holocaust survivors,Julius Genachowski.And let me commend you for recognizing a woman who has devoted her life to preserving thelessons of the shoah for future generations -- Sara Bloomfield of the United States HolocaustMemorial Museum in Washington.But most of all, I want to thank those of you who found the strength to come back again, somany years later, despite the horror you saw here, the suffering you endured here, and theloved ones you lost here. Those of us who did not live through those dark days will never trulyunderstand what it means to have hate literally etched into your arms. But we understand themessage that you carry in your hearts.For you know the truth that Elie Wiesel spoke when I stood with him at Buchenwald lastspring.  There, where his father and so many innocent souls left this earth, Elie said:""...memory has become [a] sacred duty of all people of goodwill.We have a sacred duty to remember the twisted thinking that led here -- how a great societyof culture and science succumbed to the worst instincts of man and rationalized mass murderand one of the most barbaric acts in history.We have a sacred duty to remember the cruelty that occurred here, as told in the simpleobjects that speak to us even now: the suitcases that still bear their names; the wooden clogsthey wore; the round bowls from which they ate; those brick buildings from which there wasno escape -- where so many Jews died with Shma Israel on their lips; and the very earth atAuschwitz, which is still hallowed by their ashes -- Jews and those who tried to save them,Polish and Hungarian, French and Dutch, Roma and Russian, straight and gay, and so manyothers.But even as we recall mans capacity for evil, Auschwitz also tells another story -- of manscapacity for good: the small acts of compassion -- the sharing of some bread that kept a childalive; the great acts of resistance that blew up the crematorium and tried to stop theslaughter; the Polish Rescuers; and those who earned their place forever in the RighteousAmong the Nations.And you: the survivors.The perpetrators of that crime tried to annihilate the entire Jewish people. But they failed.Because 65 years ago today, when the gates flew open, you were still standing. And everyday that you have lived, every child and grandchild that your families have brought into theworld with love, every day the sun rises on the Jewish state of Israel -- that is the ultimaterebuke to the ignorance and hatred of this place.So to those of you who have come back today, I say, no, you are not former prisoners. Youare living memorials: living memorials to the loved ones you left here, and to the spirit wemust strive to uphold in our time -- not simply to bear witness, but to bear a burden -- theburden of seeing our common humanity; of resisting anti-Semitism and ignorance in all itsforms; of refusing to become bystanders to evil, whenever and wherever it rears its ugly face.Let that be the true meaning of Auschwitz. Let that be the liberation we celebrate today -- aliberation of the spirit that, if embraced, can lead us all -- individuals and as nations -- to beamong the righteous.May God bless you all, and may God bless the memory of all those who rest here.",obama

"Thank you, John, for the gracious introduction.  To Mike and Eric, thank you for hosting me. Thank you to all of you for receiving me.  It is  wonderful to be here.  I want to alsoacknowledge Mark Strand, president of the Congressional Institute.  To all the familymembers who are here and who have to put up with us for an elective office each and everyday, thank you, because I know that's tough.I very much am appreciative of not only the tone of your introduction, John, but also theinvitation that you extended to me.  You know what they say, ""Keep your friends close, butvisit the Republican Caucus every few months.""Part of the reason I accepted your invitation to come here was because I wanted to speakwith all of you, and not just to all of you.  So I'm looking forward to taking your questions andhaving a real conversation in a few moments.  And I hope that the conversation we begin heredoesn't end here; that we can continue our dialogue in the days ahead.  It's important to methat we do so.  It's important to you, I think, that we do so.  But most importantly, it'simportant to the American people that we do so.I've said this before, but I'm a big believer not just in the value of a loyal opposition, but in itsnecessity.  Having differences of opinion, having a real debate about matters of domesticpolicy and national security -- and that's not something that's only good for our country, it'sabsolutely essential.  It's only through the process of disagreement and debate that bad ideasget tossed out and good ideas get refined and made better.  And that kind of vigorous backand forth -- that imperfect but well-founded process, messy as it often is -- is at the heart ofour democracy.  That's what makes us the greatest nation in the world.So, yes, I want you to challenge my ideas, and I guarantee you that after reading this I maychallenge a few of yours. I want you to stand up for your beliefs, and knowing this caucus, Ihave no doubt that you will.  I want us to have a constructive debate.  The only thing I don'twant -- and here I am listening to the American people, and I think they don't want either --is for Washington to continue being so Washington-like.  I know folks, when we're in townthere, spend a lot of time reading the polls and looking at focus groups and interpreting whichparty has the upper hand in November and in 2012 and so on and so on and so on.  That'stheir obsession.And I'm not a pundit.  I'm just a President, so take it for what it's worth.  But I don't believethat the American people want us to focus on our job security.  They want us to focus on theirjob security. I don't think they want more gridlock.  I don't think they want morepartisanship.  I don't think they want more obstruction.  They didn't send us to Washington tofight each other in some sort of political steel-cage match to see who comes out alive.  That'snot what they want.  They sent us to Washington to work together, to get things done, and tosolve the problems that they're grappling with every single day.And I think your constituents would want to know that despite the fact it doesn't get a lot ofattention, you and I have actually worked together on a number of occasions.  There havebeen times where we've acted in a bipartisan fashion.  And I want to thank you and yourDemocratic colleagues for reaching across the aisle.  There has been, for example, broadsupport for putting in the troops necessary in Afghanistan to deny al Qaeda safe haven, tobreak the Taliban's momentum, and to train Afghan security forces.  There's been broadsupport for disrupting, dismantling, and defeating al Qaeda.  And I know that we're all unitedin our admiration of our troops.So it may be useful for the international audience right now to understand -- and certainly forour enemies to have no doubt -- whatever divisions and differences may exist in Washington,the United States of America stands as one to defend our country.It's that same spirit of bipartisanship that made it possible for me to sign a defensecontracting reform bill that was cosponsored by Senator McCain and members of Congresshere today.  We've stood together on behalf of our nation's veterans.  Together we passed thelargest increase in the VA's budget in more than 30 years and supported essential veterans'health care reforms to provide better access and medical care for those who serve in uniform.Some of you also joined Democrats in supporting a Credit Card Bill of Rights and in extendingunemployment compensation to Americans who are out of work.  Some of you joined us instopping tobacco companies from targeting kids, expanding opportunities for young people toserve our country, and helping responsible homeowners stay in their homes.So we have a track record of working together.  It is possible.  But, as John, you mentioned,on some very big things, we've seen party-line votes that, I'm just going to be honest, weredisappointing.  Let's start with our efforts to jumpstart the economy last winter, when wewere losing 700,000 jobs a month.  Our financial system teetered on the brink of collapse andthe threat of a second Great Depression loomed large.  I didn't understand then, and I stilldon't understand, why we got opposition in this caucus for almost $300 billion in badly neededtax cuts for the American people, or COBRA coverage to help Americans who've lost jobs inthis recession to keep the health insurance that they desperately needed, or opposition toputting Americans to work laying broadband and rebuilding roads and bridges and breakingground on new construction projects.There was an interesting headline in CNN today:  ""Americans disapprove of stimulus, but likeevery policy in it.""  And there was a poll that showed that if you broke it down into itscomponent parts, 80 percent approved of the tax cuts, 80 percent approved of theinfrastructure, 80 percent approved of the assistance to the unemployed.Well, that's what the Recovery Act was.  And let's face it, some of you have been at theribbon-cuttings for some of these important projects in your communities.  Now, I understandsome of you had some philosophical differences perhaps on the just the concept ofgovernment spending, but, as I recall, opposition was declared before we had a chance toactually meet and exchange ideas.  And I saw that as a missed opportunity.Now, I am happy to report this morning that we saw another sign that our economy is movingin the right direction.  The latest GDP numbers show that our economy is growing by almost 6percent -- that's the most since 2003.  To put that in perspective, this time last year, weweren't seeing positive job growth; we were seeing the economy shrink by about 6 percent.So you've seen a 12 percent reversal during the course of this year.  This turnaround is thebiggest in nearly three decades -- and it didn't happen by accident.  It happened -- aseconomists, conservative and liberal, will attest -- because of some of the steps that we took. And by the way, you mentioned a Web site out here, John --  if you want to look at what'sgoing on, on the Recovery Act, you can look on recovery.gov -- a Web site, by the way, thatwas Eric Cantor's idea.Now, here's the point.  These are serious times, and what's required by all of us -- Democratsand Republicans -- is to do what's right for our country, even if it's not always what's best forour politics.  I know it may be heresy to say this, but there are things more important thangood poll numbers.And on this no one can accuse me of not living by my principles. A middle class that's back onits feet, an economy that lifts everybody up, an America that's ascendant in the world -- that'smore important than winning an election.  Our future shouldn't be shaped by what's best forour politics; our politics should be shaped by what's best for our future.But no matter what's happened in the past, the important thing for all of us is to moveforward together.  We have some issues right in front of us on which I believe we shouldagree, because as successful as we've been in spurring new economic growth, everybodyunderstands that job growth has been lagging.  Some of that's predictable.  Every economistwill say jobs are a lagging indicator, but that's no consolation for the folks who are out theresuffering right now.  And since 7 million Americans have lost their jobs in this recession, we'vegot to do everything we can to accelerate it.So, today, in line with what I stated at the State of the Union, I've proposed a new jobs taxcredit for small business.  And here's how it would work.  Employers would get a tax credit ofup to $5,000 for every employee they add in 2010.  They'd get a tax break for increases inwages, as well.  So, if you raise wages for employees making under $100,000, we'd refundpart of your payroll tax for every dollar you increase those wages faster than inflation.  It's asimple concept.  It's easy to understand.  It would cut taxes for more than 1 million smallbusinesses.So I hope you join me.  Let's get this done.  I want to eliminate the capital gains tax for smallbusiness investment, and take some of the bailout money the Wall Street banks havereturned and use it to help community banks start lending to small businesses again.  So joinme.  I am confident that we can do this together for the American people.  And there'snothing in that proposal that runs contrary to the ideological predispositions of this caucus. The question is:  What's going to keep us from getting this done?I've proposed a modest fee on the nation's largest banks and financial institutions to fullyrecover for taxpayers' money that they provided to the financial sector when it was teeteringon the brink of collapse.  And it's designed to discourage them from taking reckless risks inthe future.  If you listen to the American people, John, they'll tell you they want their moneyback.  Let's do this together, Republicans and Democrats.I propose that we close tax loopholes that reward companies for shipping American jobsoverseas, and instead give companies greater incentive to create jobs right here at home --right here at home.  Surely, that's something that we can do together, Republicans andDemocrats.We know that we've got a major fiscal challenge in reining in deficits that have been growingfor a decade, and threaten our future.  That's why I've proposed a three-year freeze indiscretionary spending other than what we need for national security.  That's something weshould do together that's consistent with a lot of the talk both in Democratic caucuses andRepublican caucuses.  We can't blink when it's time to actually do the job.At this point, we know that the budget surpluses of the '90s occurred in part because of thepay-as-you-go law, which said that, well, you should pay as you go and live within our means,just like families do every day.  Twenty-four of you voted for that, and I appreciate it.  And wewere able to pass it in the Senate yesterday.But the idea of a bipartisan fiscal commission to confront the deficits in the long term died inthe Senate the other day.  So I'm going to establish such a commission by executive orderand I hope that you participate, fully and genuinely, in that effort, because if we're going toactually deal with our deficit and debt, everybody here knows that we're going to have to do ittogether, Republican and Democrat.  No single party is going to make the tough choicesinvolved on its own.  It's going to require all of us doing what's right for the American people.And as I said in the State of the Union speech, there's not just a deficit of dollars inWashington, there is a deficit of trust.  So I hope you'll support my proposal to make allcongressional earmarks public before they come to a vote.  And let's require lobbyists whoexercise such influence to publicly disclose all their contacts on behalf of their clients, whetherthey are contacts with my administration or contacts with Congress.  Let's do the people'sbusiness in the bright light of day, together, Republicans and Democrats.I know how bitter and contentious the issue of health insurance reform has become.  And Iwill eagerly look at the ideas and better solutions on the health care front.  If anyone heretruly believes our health insurance system is working well for people, I respect your right tosay so, but I just don't agree.  And neither would millions of Americans with preexistingconditions who can't get coverage today or find out that they lose their insurance just asthey're getting seriously ill.  That's exactly when you need insurance.  And for too manypeople, they're not getting it.  I don't think a system is working when small businesses aregouged and 15,000 Americans are losing coverage every single day; when premiums havedoubled and out-of-pocket costs have exploded and they're poised to do so again.I mean, to be fair, the status quo is working for the insurance industry, but it's not working forthe American people.  It's not working for our federal budget.  It needs to change.This is a big problem, and all of us are called on to solve it.  And that's why, from the start, Isought out and supported ideas from Republicans.  I even talked about an issue that has beena holy grail for a lot of you, which was tort reform, and said that I'd be willing to worktogether as part of a comprehensive package to deal with it.  I just didn't get a lot of nibbles.Creating a high-risk pool for uninsured folks with preexisting conditions, that wasn't my idea,it was Senator McCain's.  And I supported it, and it got incorporated into our approach. Allowing insurance companies to sell coverage across state lines to add choice andcompetition and bring down costs for businesses and consumers -- that's an idea that some ofyou I suspect included in this better solutions; that's an idea that was incorporated into ourpackage.  And I support it, provided that we do it hand in hand with broader reforms thatprotect benefits and protect patients and protect the American people.A number of you have suggested creating pools where self-employed and small businessescould buy insurance.  That was a good idea.  I embraced it.  Some of you supported efforts toprovide insurance to children and let kids remain covered on their parents' insurance untilthey're 25 or 26.  I supported that.  That's part of our package.  I supported a number ofother ideas, from incentivizing wellness to creating an affordable catastrophic insurance optionfor young people that came from Republicans like Mike Enzi and Olympia Snowe in theSenate, and I'm sure from some of you as well.  So when you say I ought to be willing toaccept Republican ideas on health care, let's be clear:  I have.Bipartisanship -- not for its own sake but to solve problems -- that's what our constituents,the American people, need from us right now.  All of us then have a choice to make.  We haveto choose whether we're going to be politicians first or partners for progress; whether we'regoing to put success at the polls ahead of the lasting success we can achieve together forAmerica.  Just think about it for a while.  We don't have to put it up for a vote today.Let me close by saying this.  I was not elected by Democrats or Republicans, but by theAmerican people.  That's especially true because the fastest growing group of Americans areindependents.  That should tell us both something.  I'm ready and eager to work with anyonewho is willing to proceed in a spirit of goodwill.  But understand, if we can't break free frompartisan gridlock, if we can't move past a politics of ""no,"" if resistance supplants constructivedebate, I still have to meet my responsibilities as President.  I've got to act for the greatergood - because that, too, is a commitment that I have made.  And that's -- that, too, is whatthe American people sent me to Washington to do.So I am optimistic.  I know many of you individually.  And the irony, I think, of our politicalclimate right now is that, compared to other countries, the differences between the two majorparties on most issues is not as big as it's represented.  But we've gotten caught up in thepolitical game in a way that's just not healthy.  It's dividing our country in ways that arepreventing us from meeting the challenges of the 21st century.  I'm hopeful that theconversation we have today can help reverse that.So thank you very much.  Thank you, John. Now I'd like to open it up for questions.Congressman Pence:  The President has agreed to take questions and members would beencouraged to raise your hand while you remain in your seat. The chair will take theprerogative to make the first remarks. Mr. President, welcome back to the House RepublicanConference.President Obama:  Thank you.Congressman Pence:  [Off microphone.]  We are pleased to have you return.  [Inaudible] ayear ago -- House Republicans said then we would make you two promises.  Number one, thatmost of the people in this room and their families would pray for you and your beautiful familyjust about every day for the next four years.  And I want to assure you we're keeping thatpromise.President Obama:  I appreciate that.Congressman Pence:  [off microphone] Number two, our pledge to you, Mr. President, wasthat door is always open.  And we hope the [inaudible] of our invitation that we [inaudible].Mr. President, several of us in this conference yesterday on the way into Baltimore stopped bythe Salvation Army homeless facility here in Baltimore.  I met a little boy, an African Americanboy, in the 8th grade, named David Carter, Jr.  When he heard that I would be seeing youtoday his eyes lit up like I had never seen.  And I told him that if he wrote you a letter I'd giveit to you, and I have.But I had a conversation with little David, Jr. and David, Sr.  His family has been strugglingwith the economy.[On microphone.]  His dad said words to me, Mr. President, that I'll never forget.  About myage and he said -- he said, Congressman, it's not like it was when we were coming up.  Hesaid, there's just no jobs.Now, last year about the time you met with us, unemployment was 7.5 percent in thiscountry.  Your administration, and your party in Congress, told us that we'd have to borrowmore than $700 billion to pay for a so-called stimulus bill.  It was a piecemeal list of projectsand boutique tax cuts, all of which was -- we were told -- had to be passed or unemploymentwould go to 8 percent, as your administration said.  Well, unemployment is 10 percent now,as you well know, Mr. President; here in Baltimore it's considerably higher.Now, Republicans offered a stimulus bill at the same time.  It cost half as much as theDemocratic proposal in Congress, and using your economic analyst models, it would havecreated twice the jobs at half the cost.  It essentially was across-the-board tax relief, Mr.President.Now we know you've come to Baltimore today and you've raised this tax credit, which waslast promoted by President Jimmy Carter.  But the first question I would pose to you, veryrespectfully, Mr. President, is would you be willing to consider embracing -- in the name oflittle David Carter, Jr. and his dad, in the name of every struggling family in this country --the kind of across-the-board tax relief that Republicans have advocated, that PresidentKennedy advocated, that President Reagan advocated and that has always been the means ofstimulating broad-based economic growth?President Obama:  Well, there was a lot packed into that question. First of all, let me say Ialready promised that I'll be writing back to that young man and his family, and I appreciateyou passing on the letter.Member: Thank you.President Obama:  But let's talk about just the jobs environment generally.  You'reabsolutely right that when I was sworn in the hope was that unemployment would remainaround 8 [percent], or in the 8 percent range.  That was just based on the estimates made byboth conservative and liberal economists, because at that point not all the data had trickledin.We had lost 650,000 jobs in December.  I'm assuming you're not faulting my policies for that. We had lost, it turns out, 700,000 jobs in January, the month I was sworn in.  I'm assuming itwasn't my administration's policies that accounted for that.  We lost another 650,000 jobs thesubsequent month, before any of my policies had gone into effect.  So I'm assuming thatwasn't as a consequence of our policies; that doesn't reflect the failure of the Recovery Act. The point being that what ended up happening was that the job losses from this recessionproved to be much more severe -- in the first quarter of last year going into the secondquarter of last year -- than anybody anticipated.So I mean, I think we can score political points on the basis of the fact that weunderestimated how severe the job losses were going to be.  But those job losses took placebefore any stimulus, whether it was the ones that you guys have proposed or the ones thatwe proposed, could have ever taken into effect.  Now, that's just the fact, Mike, and I don'tthink anybody would dispute that.  You could not find an economist who would dispute that.Now, at the same time, as I mentioned, most economists -- Republican and Democrat, liberaland conservative -- would say that had it not been for the stimulus package that we passed,things would be much worse.  Now, they didn't fill a 7 million hole in the number of peoplewho were unemployed.  They probably account for about 2 million, which means we still have5 million folks in there that we've still got to deal with.  That's a lot of people.The package that we put together at the beginning of the year, the truth is, should havereflected -- and I believe reflected what most of you would say are common sense things. This notion that this was a radical package is just not true.  A third of them were tax cuts, andthey weren't -- when you say they were ""boutique"" tax cuts, Mike, 95 percent of workingAmericans got tax cuts, small businesses got tax cuts, large businesses got help in terms oftheir depreciation schedules.  I mean, it was a pretty conventional list of tax cuts.  A third of itwas stabilizing state budgets.There is not a single person in here who, had it not been for what was in the stimuluspackage, wouldn't be going home to more teachers laid off, more firefighters laid off, morecops laid off.  A big chunk of it was unemployment insurance and COBRA, just making surethat people had some floor beneath them, and, by the way, making sure that there wasenough money in their pockets that businesses had some customers.You take those two things out, that accounts for the majority of the stimulus package.  Arethere people in this room who think that was a bad idea?  A portion of it was dealing with theAMT, the alternative minimum tax -- not a proposal of mine; that's not a consequence of mypolicies that we have a tax system where we keep on putting off a potential tax hike that isembedded in the budget that we have to fix each year.  That cost about $70 billion.And then the last portion of it was infrastructure which, as I said, a lot of you have gone toappear at ribbon-cuttings for the same projects that you voted against.Now, I say all this not to re-litigate the past, but it's simply to state that the component partsof the Recovery Act are consistent with what many of you say are important things to do --rebuilding our infrastructure, tax cuts for families and businesses, and making sure that wewere providing states and individuals some support when the roof was caving in.And the notion that I would somehow resist doing something that cost half as much but wouldproduce twice as many jobs -- why would I resist that?  I wouldn't.  I mean, that's my point,is that -- I am not an ideologue.  I'm not.  It doesn't make sense if somebody could tell meyou could do this cheaper and get increased results that I wouldn't say, great.  The problemis, I couldn't find credible economists who would back up the claims that you just made.Now, we can -- here's what I know going forward, though.  I mean, we're talking -- we weretalking about the past.  We can talk about this going forward.  I have looked at every idea outthere in terms of accelerating job growth to match the economic growth that's already takenplace.  The jobs credit that I'm discussing right now is one that a lot of people think would bethe most cost-effective way for encouraging people to pick up their hiring.There may be other ideas that you guys have; I am happy to look at them and I'm happy toembrace them.  I suspect I will embrace some of them.  Some of them I've already embraced.But the question I think we're going to have to ask ourselves is, as we move forward, are wegoing to be examining each of these issues based on what's good for the country, what theevidence tells us, or are we going to be trying to position ourselves so that come Novemberwe're able to say, ""The other party, it's their fault.""  If we take the latter approach then we'reprobably not going to get much agreement.  If we take the former, I suspect there's going tobe a lot of overlap.  All right?Congressman Pence:  Mr. President, will you consider supporting across-the-board taxrelief, as President Kennedy did?President Obama:  Here's what I'm going to do, Mike.  What I'm going to do is I'm going totake a look at what you guys are proposing.  And the reason I say this, before you say,""Okay,"" I think is important to know -- what you may consider across-the-board tax cutscould be, for example, greater tax cuts for people who are making a billion dollars.  I may notagree to a tax cut for Warren Buffet.  You may be calling for an across-the-board tax cut forthe banking industry right now.  I may not agree to that.So I think that we've got to look at what specific proposals you're putting forward, and -- thisis the last point I'll make -- if you're calling for just across-the-board tax cuts, and then on theother hand saying that we're somehow going to balance our budget, I'm going to want to takea look at your math and see how that works, because the issue of deficit and debt is anotherarea where there has been a tendency for some inconsistent statements.  How's that?  Allright?Congressman Ryan:  Thank you.  Mr. President, first off, thanks for agreeing to accept ourinvitation here.  It is a real pleasure and honor to have you with us here today.President Obama:  Good to see you.  Is this your crew right here, by the way?Congressman Ryan:  It is.  This is my daughter Liza, my son Charlie and Sam, and this ismy wife Janna. President Obama:  Hey, guys.Congressman Ryan:  Say hi, everybody. I serve as a ranking member of the budgetcommittee, so I'm going to talk a little budget if you don't mind.  The spending bills thatyou've signed into law, the domestic discretionary spending has been increased by 84percent.  You now want to freeze spending at this elevated beginning next year.  This meansthat total spending in your budget would grow at 3/100ths of 1 percent less than otherwise.  Iwould simply submit that we could do more and start now.You've also said that you want to take a scalpel to the budget and go through it line by line. We want to give you that scalpel.  I have a proposal with my home state senator, RussFeingold, bipartisan proposal, to create a constitutional version of the line-item veto. Problemis, we can't even get a vote on the proposal.So my question is, why not start freezing spending now, and would you support a line-itemveto in helping us get a vote on it in the House?President Obama:  Let me respond to the two specific questions, but I want to just pushback a little bit on the underlying premise about us increasing spending by 84 percent.Now, look, I talked to Peter Orszag right before I came here, because I suspected I'd behearing this -- I'd be hearing this argument.  The fact of the matter is, is that most of theincreases in this year's budget, this past year's budget, were not as a consequence of policiesthat we initiated but instead were built in as a consequence of the automatic stabilizers thatkick in because of this enormous recession.So the increase in the budget for this past year was actually predicted before I was evensworn into office and had initiated any policies.  Whoever was in there, Paul -- and I don'tthink you'll dispute that -- whoever was in there would have seen those same increasesbecause of, on the one hand, huge drops in revenue, but at the same time people werehurting and needed help.  And a lot of these things happened automatically.Now, the reason that I'm not proposing the discretionary freeze take into effect this year --we prepared a budget for 2010, it's now going forward -- is, again, I am just listening to theconsensus among people who know the economy best.  And what they will say is that if youeither increase taxes or significantly lowered spending when the economy remains somewhatfragile, that that would have a destimulative effect and potentially you'd see a lot of folkslosing business, more folks potentially losing jobs.  That would be a mistake when theeconomy has not fully taken off.  That's why I've proposed to do it for the next fiscal year.  Sothat's point number two.With respect to the line-item veto, I actually -- I think there's not a President out there thatwouldn't love to have it.  And I think that this is an area where we can have a seriousconversation.  I know it is a bipartisan proposal by you and Russ Feingold.  I don't like beingheld up with big bills that have stuff in them that are wasteful but I've got to sign because it'sa defense authorization bill and I've got to make sure that our troops are getting the fundingthat they need.I will tell you, I would love for Congress itself to show discipline on both sides of the aisle.  Ithink one thing that you have to acknowledge, Paul, because you study this stuff and take itpretty seriously, that the earmarks problem is not unique to one party and you end up gettinga lot of pushback when you start going after specific projects of any one of you in yourdistricts, because wasteful spending is usually spent somehow outside of your district.  Haveyou noticed that?  The spending in your district tends to seem pretty sensible.So I would love to see more restraint within Congress.  I'd like to work on the earmarksreforms that I mentioned in terms of putting earmarks online, because I think sunshine is thebest disinfectant.  But I am willing to have a serious conversation on the line-item veto issue.Congressman Ryan:  I'd like to walk you through that, because we have a version we thinkis constitutional.President Obama:  Let me take a look at it.Congressman Ryan:  I would simply say that automatic stabilizer spending is mandatoryspending.  The discretionary spending, the bills that Congress signs that you sign into law,that has increased 84 percent.President Obama:  We'll have a longer debate on the budget numbers, all right?Congressman Pence:  Shelley Moore Capito, West Virginia.Congresswoman Capito:  Thank you, Mr. President, for joining us here today.  As you saidin the State of the Union address on Wednesday, jobs and the economy are number one.  AndI think everyone in this room, certainly I, agree with you on that.I represent the state of West Virginia.  We're resource-rich.  We have a lot of coal and a lot ofnatural gas.  But our -- my miners and the folks who are working and those who areunemployed are very concerned about some of your policies in these areas:  cap and trade,an aggressive EPA, and the looming prospect of higher taxes.  In our minds, these are job-killing policies.  So I'm asking you if you would be willing to re-look at some of these policies,with a high unemployment and the unsure economy that we have now, to assure WestVirginians that you're listening.President Obama:  Look, I listen all the time, including to your governor, who's somebodywho I enjoyed working with a lot before the campaign and now that I'm President.  And Iknow that West Virginia struggles with unemployment, and I know how important coal is toWest Virginia and a lot of the natural resources there.  That's part of the reason why I've saidthat we need a comprehensive energy policy that sets us up for a long-term future.For example, nobody has been a bigger promoter of clean coal technology than I am. Testament to that, I ended up being in a whole bunch of advertisements that you guys saw allthe time about investing in ways for us to burn coal more cleanly.I've said that I'm a promoter of nuclear energy, something that I think over the last threedecades has been subject to a lot of partisan wrangling and ideological wrangling.  I don'tthink it makes sense.  I think that that has to be part of our energy mix.  I've said that I amsupportive -- and I said this two nights ago at the State of the Union -- that I am in favor ofincreased production.So if you look at the ideas that this caucus has, again with respect to energy, I'm for a lot ofwhat you said you are for.The one thing that I've also said, though, and here we have a serious disagreement and myhope is we can work through these disagreements -- there's going to be an effort on theSenate side to do so on a bipartisan basis -- is that we have to plan for the future.And the future is that clean energy -- cleaner forms of energy are going to be increasinglyimportant, because even if folks are still skeptical in some cases about climate change in ourpolitics and in Congress, the world is not skeptical about it.  If we're going to be after some ofthese big markets, they're going to be looking to see, is the United States the one that'sdeveloping clean coal technology?  Is the United States developing our natural gas resourcesin the most effective way?  Is the United States the one that is going to lead in electric cars? Because if we're not leading, those other countries are going to be leading.So what I want to do is work with West Virginia to figure out how we can seize that future. But to do that, that means there's going to have to be some transition.  We can't operate thecoal industry in the United States as if we're still in the 1920s or the 1930s or the 1950s. We've got to be thinking what does that industry look like in the next hundred years.  And it'sgoing to be different.  And that means there's going to be some transition.  And that's where Ithink a well-thought-through policy of incentivizing the new while recognizing that there'sgoing to be a transition process -- and we're not just suddenly putting the old out of businessright away -- that has to be something that both Republicans and Democrats should be ableto embrace.Congressman Pence:  Jason Chaffetz, Utah.Congressman Chafetz:  Thank you, Mr. President.  It's truly an honor.President Obama:  Great to be here.Congressman Chafetz:  And I appreciate you being here.I'm one of 22 House freshmen.  We didn't create this mess, but we are here to help clean itup.  You talked a lot about this deficit of trust.  There's some things that have happened that Iwould appreciate your perspective on, because I can look you in the eye and tell you we havenot been obstructionists.  Democrats have the House and Senate and the presidency.  Andwhen you stood up before the American people multiple times and said you would broadcastthe health care debates on C-SPAN, you didn't.  And I was disappointed, and I think a lot ofAmericans were disappointed.You said you weren't going to allow lobbyists in the senior-most positions within youradministration, and yet you did.  I applauded you when you said it -- and disappointed whenyou didn't.You said you'd go line by line through the health care debate -- or through the health carebill.  And there were six of us, including Dr. Phil Roe, who sent you a letter and said, ""Wewould like to take you up on the offer; we'd like to come.""  We never heard a letter, we nevergot a call.  We were never involved in any of those discussions.And when you said in the House of Representatives that you were going to tackle earmarks --in fact, you didn't want to have any earmarks in any of your bills -- I jumped up out of myseat and applauded you.  But it didn't happen.More importantly, I want to talk about moving forward, but if we could address --President Obama:  Well, how about --Congressman Chafetz:  -- I would certainly appreciate it.President Obama:  That was a long list, so -- let me respond.Look, the truth of the matter is that if you look at the health care process -- just over thecourse of the year -- overwhelmingly the majority of it actually was on C-SPAN, because itwas taking place in congressional hearings in which you guys were participating.  I mean, howmany committees were there that helped to shape this bill?  Countless hearings took place.Now, I kicked it off, by the way, with a meeting with many of you, including your keyleadership.  What is true, there's no doubt about it, is that once it got through the committeeprocess and there were now a series of meetings taking place all over the Capitol trying tofigure out how to get the thing together -- that was a messy process.  And I takeresponsibility for not having structured it in a way where it was all taking place in one placethat could be filmed.  How to do that logistically would not have been as easy as it sounds,because you're shuttling back and forth between the House, the Senate, different offices, etcetera, different legislators.  But I think it's a legitimate criticism.  So on that one, I takeresponsibility.With respect to earmarks, we didn't have earmarks in the Recovery Act.  We didn't get a lot ofcredit for it, but there were no earmarks in that.  I was confronted at the beginning of myterm with an omnibus package that did have a lot of earmarks from Republicans andDemocrats, and a lot of people in this chamber.  And the question was whether I was going tohave a big budget fight, at a time when I was still trying to figure out whether or not thefinancial system was melting down and we had to make a whole bunch of emergencydecisions about the economy.  So what I said was let's keep them to a minimum, but Icouldn't excise them all.Now, the challenge I guess I would have for you as a freshman, is what are you doing insideyour caucus to make sure that I'm not the only guy who is responsible for this stuff, so thatwe're working together, because this is going to be a process?When we talk about earmarks, I think all of us are willing to acknowledge that some of themare perfectly defensible, good projects; it's just they haven't gone through the regularappropriations process in the full light of day.  So one place to start is to make sure that theyare at least transparent, that everybody knows what's there before we move forward.In terms of lobbyists, I can stand here unequivocally and say that there has not been anadministration who was tougher on making sure that lobbyists weren't participating in theadministration than any administration that's come before us.Now, what we did was, if there were lobbyists who were on boards and commissions that werecarryovers and their term hadn't been completed, we didn't kick them off.  We simply saidthat moving forward any time a new slot opens, they're being replaced.So we've actually been very consistent in making sure that we are eliminating the impact oflobbyists, day in, day out, on how this administration operates.  There have been a handful ofwaivers where somebody is highly skilled -- for example, a doctor who ran Tobacco-Free Kidstechnically is a registered lobbyist; on the other end, has more experience than anybody infiguring out how kids don't get hooked on cigarettes.So there have been a couple of instances like that, but generally we've been very consistenton that front.Congressman Pence: Marsha Blackburn, Tennessee.Congresswoman Blackburn:  Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you for acknowledgingthat we have ideas on health care because, indeed, we do have ideas, we have plans, we haveover 50 bills, we have lots of amendments that would bring health care ideas to the forefront. We would -- we've got plans to lower cost, to change purchasing models, address medicalliability, insurance accountability, chronic and preexisting conditions, and access to affordablecare for those with those conditions, insurance portability, expanded access -- but not doing itwith creating more government, more bureaucracy, and more cost for the American taxpayer.And we look forward to sharing those ideas with you.  We want to work with you on healthreform and making certain that we do it in an affordable, cost-effective way that is going toreduce bureaucracy, reduce government interference, and reduce costs to individuals and totaxpayers.  And if those good ideas aren't making it to you, maybe it's the House Democratleadership that is an impediment instead of a conduit.But we're concerned also that there are some lessons learned from public option health careplans that maybe are not being heeded.  And certainly in my state of Tennessee, we were thetest case for public option health care in 1994, and our Democrat government has evencautioned that maybe our experiences there would provide some lessons learned that shouldbe heeded, and would provide guidance for us to go forward.  And as you said, what weshould be doing is tossing old ideas out, bad ideas out, and moving forward in refining goodideas.  And certainly we would welcome that opportunity.So my question to you is, when will we look forward to starting anew and sitting down withyou to put all of these ideas on the table, to look at these lessons learned, to benefit from thatexperience, and to produce a product that is going to reduce government interference, reducecost, and be fair to the American taxpayer?President Obama:  Actually, I've gotten many of your ideas.  I've taken a look at them, evenbefore I was handed this.  Some of the ideas we have embraced in our package.  Some ofthem are embraced with caveats.  So let me give you an example.I think one of the proposals that has been focused on by the Republicans as a way to reducecosts is allowing insurance companies to sell across state lines.  We actually include that aspart of our approach.  But the caveat is, we've got to do so with some minimum standards,because otherwise what happens is that you could have insurance companies circumvent awhole bunch of state regulations about basic benefits or what have you, making sure that awoman is able to get mammograms as part of preventive care, for example.  Part of whatcould happen is insurance companies could go into states and cherry-pick and just get thosewho are healthiest and leave behind those who are least healthy, which would raiseeverybody's premiums who weren't healthy, right?So it's not that many of these ideas aren't workable, but we have to refine them to make surethat they don't just end up worsening the situation for folks rather than making it better.Now, what I said at the State of the Union is what I still believe:  If you can show me -- and ifI get confirmation from health care experts, people who know the system and how it works,including doctors and nurses -- ways of reducing people's premiums; covering those who donot have insurance; making it more affordable for small businesses; having insurance reformsthat ensure people have insurance even when they've got preexisting conditions, that theircoverage is not dropped just because they're sick, that young people right out of college or asthey're entering in the workforce can still get health insurance -- if those component parts arethings that you care about and want to do, I'm game.  And I've got -- and I've got a lot ofthese ideas.The last thing I will say, though -- let me say this about health care and the health caredebate, because I think it also bears on a whole lot of other issues.  If you look at the packagethat we've presented -- and there's some stray cats and dogs that got in there that we wereeliminating, we were in the process of eliminating.  For example, we said from the start that itwas going to be important for us to be consistent in saying to people if you can have your -- ifyou want to keep the health insurance you got, you can keep it, that you're not going to haveanybody getting in between you and your doctor in your decision making.  And I think thatsome of the provisions that got snuck in might have violated that pledge.And so we were in the process of scrubbing this and making sure that it's tight.  But at itscore, if you look at the basic proposal that we've put forward:  it has an exchange so thatbusinesses and the self-employed can buy into a pool and can get bargaining power the sameway big companies do; the insurance reforms that I've already discussed, making sure thatthere's choice and competition for those who don't have health insurance.  The componentparts of this thing are pretty similar to what Howard Baker, Bob Dole, and Tom Daschleproposed at the beginning of this debate last year.Now, you may not agree with Bob Dole and Howard Baker, and, certainly you don't agree withTom Daschle on much, but that's not a radical bunch.  But if you were to listen to the debateand, frankly, how some of you went after this bill, you'd think that this thing was someBolshevik plot.  No, I mean, that's how you guys -- that's how you guys presented it.And so I'm thinking to myself, well, how is it that a plan that is pretty centrist -- no, look, Imean, I'm just saying, I know you guys disagree, but if you look at the facts of this bill, mostindependent observers would say this is actually what many Republicans -- is similar to whatmany Republicans proposed to Bill Clinton when he was doing his debate on health care.So all I'm saying is, we've got to close the gap a little bit between the rhetoric and the reality. I'm not suggesting that we're going to agree on everything, whether it's on health care orenergy or what have you, but if the way these issues are being presented by the Republicansis that this is some wild-eyed plot to impose huge government in every aspect of our lives,what happens is you guys then don't have a lot of room to negotiate with me.I mean, the fact of the matter is, is that many of you, if you voted with the administration onsomething, are politically vulnerable in your own base, in your own party.  You've givenyourselves very little room to work in a bipartisan fashion because what you've been tellingyour constituents is, this guy is doing all kinds of crazy stuff that's going to destroy America.And I would just say that we have to think about tone.  It's not just on your side, by the way -- it's on our side, as well.  This is part of what's happened in our politics, where we demonizethe other side so much that when it comes to actually getting things done, it becomes toughto do.Mike [Pence].Congressman Pence:  Dr. Tom Price from Georgia, and then we'll have one more after thatif your time permits, Mr. President.President Obama:  You know, I'm having fun.Congressman Pence:  Okay.President Obama:  This is great.Congressman Pence:  So are we.Congressman Price:  Mr. President, thank you.  I want to stick on the general topic of healthcare, but ask a very specific question.  You have repeatedly said, most recently at the State ofthe Union, that Republicans have offered no ideas and no solutions.  In spite of the fact --President Obama:  I don't think I said that.  What I said was, within the context of healthcare -- I remember that speech pretty well, it was only two days ago -- I said I welcome ideasthat you might provide.  I didn't say that you haven't provided ideas.  I said I welcome thoseideas that you'll provide.Congressman Price:  Mr. President, multiple times, from your administration, there havecome statements that Republicans have no ideas and no solutions.  In spite of the fact thatwe've offered, as demonstrated today, positive solutions to all of the challenges we face,including energy and the economy and health care, specifically in the area of health care --this bill, H.R.3400, that has more co-sponsors than any health care bill in the House, is a billthat would provide health coverage for all Americans; would correct the significant insurancechallenges of affordability and preexisting; would solve the lawsuit abuse issue, which isn'taddressed significantly in the other proposals that went through the House and the Senate;would write into law that medical decisions are made between patients and families anddoctors; and does all of that without raising taxes by a penny.But my specific question is, what should we tell our constituents who know that Republicanshave offered positive solutions to the challenges that Americans face and yet continue to hearout of the administration that we've offered nothing?President Obama:  Tom, look, I have to say that on the -- let's just take the health caredebate.  And it's probably not constructive for us to try to debate a particular bill -- this isn'tthe venue to do it.  But if you say, ""We can offer coverage for all Americans, and it won't costa penny,"" that's just not true.  You can't structure a bill where suddenly 30 million peoplehave coverage, and it costs nothing.  If --Congressman Price:  Mr. President, can I -- and I understand that we're not interested indebating this bill, but what should we tell our constituents who know that we've offered thesesolutions and yet hear from the administration that we have offered nothing.President Obama:  Let me -- I'm using this as a specific example, so let me answer yourquestion.  You asked a question; I want to answer it.It's not enough if you say, for example, that we've offered a health care plan and I look up --this is just under the section that you've just provided me, or the book that you just providedme -- summary of GOP health care reform bill:  The GOP plan will lower health care premiumsfor American families and small businesses, addressing America's number-one priority forhealth reform.  I mean, that's an idea that we all embrace.  But specifically it's got to work.  Imean, there's got to be a mechanism in these plans that I can go to an independent healthcare expert and say, is this something that will actually work, or is it boilerplate?If I'm told, for example, that the solution to dealing with health care costs is tort reform,something that I've said I am willing to work with you on, but the CBO or other experts say tome, at best, this could reduce health care costs relative to where they're growing by a coupleof percentage points, or save $5 billion a year, that's what we can score it at, and it will notbend the cost curve long term or reduce premiums significantly -- then you can't make theclaim that that's the only thing that we have to do.  If we're going to do multi-state insuranceso that people can go across state lines, I've got to be able to go to an independent healthcare expert, Republican or Democrat, who can tell me that this won't result in cherry-pickingof the healthiest going to some and the least healthy being worse off.So I am absolutely committed to working with you on these issues, but it can't just be politicalassertions that aren't substantiated when it comes to the actual details of policy.  Becauseotherwise, we're going to be selling the American people a bill of goods.  I mean, the easiestthing for me to do on the health care debate would have been to tell people that what you'regoing to get is guaranteed health insurance, lower your costs, all the insurance reforms; we'regoing to lower the costs of Medicare and Medicaid and it won't cost anybody anything.  That'sgreat politics, it's just not true.So there's got to be some test of realism in any of these proposals, mine included.  I've got tohold myself accountable, and guaranteed the American people will hold themselves -- will holdme accountable if what I'm selling doesn't actually deliver.Congressman Price:  Mr. President, a point of clarification, what's in the Better Solutionsbook are all the legislative proposals that were offered --President Obama:  I understand that.  I've actually read your bills.Congressman Price:  -- throughout 2009.President Obama:  I understand.Congressman Price:  And so, rest assured the summary document you received is backedup by precisely the kind of detailed legislation that Speaker Pelosi and your administrationhave been busy ignoring for 12 months.President Obama:  Well, Mike -- well, hold on, hold on a second.  No, no, no, no.  Hold on asecond, guys.You know, Mike, I've read your legislation.  I mean, I take a look at this stuff -- and the goodideas we take.  But here's -- here's the thing -- here's the thing that I guess all of us have tobe mindful of, it can't be all or nothing, one way or the other.  And what I mean by that isthis:  If we put together a stimulus package in which a third of it are tax cuts that normallyyou guys would support, and support for states and the unemployed, and helping people stayon COBRA that your governors certainly would support -- Democrat or a Republican; and thenyou've got some infrastructure, and maybe there's some things in there that you dont like interms of infrastructure, or you think the bill should have been $500 billion instead of $700billion or there's this provision or that provision that you don't like.  If there's uniformopposition because the Republican caucus doesn't get 100 percent or 80 percent of what youwant, then it's going to be hard to get a deal done.  That's because that's not how democracy works.So my hope would be that we can look at some of these component parts of what we're doingand maybe we break some of them up on different policy issues.  So if the good congressmanfrom Utah has a particular issue on lobbying reform that he wants to work with us on, we maynot able to agree on a comprehensive package on everything but there may be somecomponent parts that we can work on.You may not support our overall jobs package, but if you look at the tax credit that we'reproposing for small businesses right now, it is consistent with a lot of what you guys have saidin the past.  And just the fact that it's my administration that's proposing it shouldn't preventyou from supporting it.  That's my point.Congressman Pence:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Peter Roskam from the great state ofIllinois.President Obama:  Oh, Peter is an old friend of mine.Congressman Roskam:  Hey, Mr. President.President Obama:  Peter and I have had many debates.Congressman Roskam:  Well, this won't be one.  Mr. President, I heard echoes today of thestate senator that I served with in Springfield and there was an attribute and a characteristicthat you had that I think served you well there.  You took on some very controversial subjects-- death penalty reform -- you and I --President Obama:  Sure.  We worked on it together.Congressman Roskam:  -- negotiated on.  You took on ethics reform.  You took on some bigthings.  One of the keys was you rolled your sleeves up, you worked with the other party, andultimately you were able to make the deal.  Now, here's an observation.Over the past year, in my view, that attribute hasn't been in full bloom.  And by that I mean,you've gotten this subtext of House Republicans that sincerely want to come and be a part ofthis national conversation toward solutions, but they've really been stiff-armed by SpeakerPelosi.  Now, I know you're not in charge of that chamber, but there really is this dynamic of,frankly, being shut out.  When John Boehner and Eric Cantor presented last February to yousome substantive job creation, our stimulus alternative, the attack machine began tomarginalize Eric -- and we can all look at the articles -- as ""Mr. No,"" and there was this prettydark story, ultimately, that wasn't productive and wasn't within this sort of framework thatyou're articulating today.So here's the question.  Moving forward, I think all of us want to hit the reset button on2009.  How do we move forward?  And on the job creation piece in particular, you mentionedColombia, you mentioned Panama, you mentioned South Korea.  Are you willing to work withus, for example, to make sure those FTAs get called, that's no-cost job creation?  Andultimately, as you're interacting with world leaders, that's got to put more arrows in yourquiver, and that's a very, very powerful tool for us.  But the obstacle is, frankly, the politicswithin the Democratic caucus?President Obama:  Well, first of all, Peter and I did work together effectively on a whole hostof issues.  One of our former colleagues is right now running for governor, on the Republicanside, in Illinois.  In the Republican primary, of course, they're running ads of him saying nicethings about me.  Poor guy.Although that's one of the points that I made earlier.  I mean, we've got to be careful aboutwhat we say about each other sometimes, because it boxes us in in ways that makes itdifficult for us to work together, because our constituents start believing us.  They don't knowsometimes this is just politics what you guys -- or folks on my side do sometimes. So just a tone of civility instead of slash and burn would be helpful.  The problem we havesometimes is a media that responds only to slash-and-burn-style politics.  You don't get a lotof credit if I say, ""You know, I think Paul Ryan is a pretty sincere guy and has a beautifulfamily.""  Nobody is going to run that in the newspapers.Question: [Inaudible]President Obama:  And by the way, in case he's going to get a Republican challenge, I didn'tmean it.  Don't want to hurt you, man.But on the specifics, I think both sides can take some blame for a sour climate on Capitol Hill. What I can do maybe to help is to try to bring Republican and Democratic leadership togetheron a more regular basis with me.  That's, I think, a failure on my part, is to try to foster bettercommunications even if there's disagreement.  And I will try to see if we can do more of thatthis year.  That's on the sort of the general issue.On the specific issue of trade, you're right, there are conflicts within and fissures within theDemocratic Party.  I suspect there are probably going to be some fissures within theRepublican Party, as well.  I mean, you know, if you went to some of your constituencies,they'd be pretty suspicious about it, new trade agreements, because the suspicion is somehowthey're all one way.So part of what we've been trying to do is to make sure that we're getting the enforcementside of this tight, make sure that if we've got a trade agreement with China or other countries,that they are abiding with it -- they're not stealing our intellectual property or making surethat their non-tariff barriers are lowered even as ours are opened up.  And my hope is, is thatwe can move forward with some of these trade agreements having built some confidence --not just among particular constituency groups, but among the American people -- that trade isgoing to be reciprocal; that it's not just going to be a one-way street.You are absolutely right though, Peter, when you say, for example, South Korea is a great allyof ours.  I mean, when I visited there, there is no country that is more committed tofriendship on a whole range of fronts than South Korea.  What is also true is that theEuropean Union is about to sign a trade agreement with South Korea, which means right atthe moment when they start opening up their markets, the Europeans might get in therebefore we do.So we've got to make sure that we seize these opportunities.  I will be talking more abouttrade this year.  It's going to have to be trade that combines opening their markets with anenforcement mechanism, as well as just opening up our markets.  I think that's somethingthat all of us would agree on.  Let's see if we can execute it over the next several years.  Allright, is that it?Congressman Pence:  Jeb Hensarling, Texas.  And that will be it, Mr. President.President Obama:  Jim [sic] is going to wrap things up?Congressman Pence:  Yes, sir.President Obama:  All right.Congressman Hensarling:  Jeb, Mr. President.President Obama:  How are you?Congressman Hensarling:  I'm doing well.  Mr. President, a year ago I had an opportunityto speak to you about the national debt.  And something that you and I have in common is weboth have small children.President Obama:  Absolutely.Congressman Hensarling:  And I left that conversation really feeling your sincerecommitment to ensuring that our children, our nation's children, do not inherit anunconscionable debt.  We know that under current law, that government -- the cost ofgovernment is due to grow from 20 percent of our economy to 40 percent of our economy,right about the time our children are leaving college and getting that first job.Mr. President, shortly after that conversation a year ago, the Republicans proposed a budgetthat ensured that government did not grow beyond the historical standard of 20 percent ofGDP.  It was a budget that actually froze immediately non-defense discretionary spending.  Itspent $5 trillion less than ultimately what was enacted into law, and unfortunately, I believethat budget was ignored.  And since that budget was ignored, what were the old annualdeficits under Republicans have now become the monthly deficits under Democrats.  Thenational debt has increased 30 percent.Now, Mr. President, I know you believe -- and I understand the argument, and I respect theview that the spending is necessary due to the recession; many of us believe, frankly, it's partof the problem, not part of the solution.  But I understand and I respect your view.  But this iswhat I don't understand, Mr. President.  After that discussion, your administration proposed abudget that would triple the national debt over the next 10 years -- surely you don't believe10 years from now we will still be mired in this recession -- and propose new entitlementspending and move the cost of government to almost 24.5 percent of the economy.Now, very soon, Mr. President, you're due to submit a new budget.  And my question is --President Obama:  Jeb, I know there's a question in there somewhere, because you'remaking a whole bunch of assertions, half of which I disagree with, and I'm having to sit herelistening to them.  At some point I know you're going to let me answer.  All right.Congressman Hensarling:  That's the question.  You are soon to submit a new budget, Mr.President.  Will that new budget, like your old budget, triple the national debt and continue totake us down the path of increasing the cost of government to almost 25 percent of oureconomy?  That's the question, Mr. President.President Obama:  Jeb, with all due respect, I've just got to take this last question as anexample of how it's very hard to have the kind of bipartisan work that we're going to do,because the whole question was structured as a talking point for running a campaign.Now, look, let's talk about the budget once again, because I'll go through it with you line byline.  The fact of the matter is, is that when we came into office, the deficit was $1.3 trillion --$1.3 [trillion.]  So when you say that suddenly I've got a monthly budget that is higher thanthe -- a monthly deficit that's higher than the annual deficit left by the Republicans, that'sfactually just not true, and you know it's not true.And what is true is that we came in already with a $1.3 trillion deficit before I had passed anylaw.  What is true is we came in with $8 trillion worth of debt over the next decade -- hadnothing to do with anything that we had done.  It had to do with the fact that in 2000 whenthere was a budget surplus of $200 billion, you had a Republican administration and aRepublican Congress, and we had two tax cuts that weren't paid for.You had a prescription drug plan -- the biggest entitlement plan, by the way, in severaldecades -- that was passed without it being paid for.  You had two wars that were donethrough supplementals.  And then you had $3 trillion projected because of the lost revenue ofthis recession.  That's $8 trillion.Now, we increased it by a trillion dollars because of the spending that we had to make on thestimulus.  I am happy to have any independent fact-checker out there take a look at yourpresentation versus mine in terms of the accuracy of what I just said.Now, going forward, here's the deal.  I think, Paul, for example, head of the budgetcommittee, has looked at the budget and has made a serious proposal.  I've read it.  I can tellyou what's in it.  And there are some ideas in there that I would agree with, but there aresome ideas that we should have a healthy debate about because I don't agree with them.The major driver of our long-term liabilities, everybody here knows, is Medicare and Medicaidand our health care spending.  Nothing comes close.  Social Security we could probably fix thesame way Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan sat down together and they could figure somethingout.  That is manageable.  Medicare and Medicaid -- massive problem down the road.  That'swhere -- that's going to be what our children have to worry about.Now, Paul's approach -- and I want to be careful not simplifying this, because I know you'vegot a lot of detail in your plan -- but if I understand it correctly, would say we're going toprovide vouchers of some sort for current Medicare recipients at the current level --Congressman Ryan:  No.President Obama:  No?Congressman Ryan:  People 55 and above --President Obama:  Fifty-five and -- well, no, I understand.  I mean, there's a grandfatheringin, but just for future beneficiaries, right?  That's why I said I didn't want to -- I want to makesure that I'm not being unfair to your proposal, but I just want to point out that I've read it. And the basic idea would be that at some point we hold Medicare cost per recipient constantas a way of making sure that that doesn't go way out of whack, and I'm sure there are somedetails that --Congressman Ryan:  We drew it as a blend of inflation and health inflation, the point of ourplan is -- because Medicare, as you know, is a $38 trillion unfunded liability -- it has to bereform for younger generations because it won't exist because it's going bankrupt.  And thepremise of our idea is, look, why not give people the same kind of health care plan we herehave in Congress?  That's the kind of reform we're proposing for Medicare.President Obama:  No, I understand.  Right, right.  Well, look, as I said before, this is anentirely legitimate proposal.  The problem is twofold:  One is that depending on how it'sstructured, if recipients are suddenly getting a plan that has their reimbursement rates goinglike this, but health care costs are still going up like that, then over time the way we're savingmoney is essentially by capping what they're getting relative to their costs.Now, I just want to point out -- and this brings me to the second problem -- when we made avery modest proposal as part of our package, our health care reform package, to eliminate thesubsidies going to insurance companies for Medicare Advantage, we were attacked across theboard, by many on your aisle, for slashing Medicare.  You remember?  We're going to startcutting benefits for seniors.  That was the story that was perpetrated out there -- scared thedickens out of a lot of seniors.No, no, but here's my point.  If the main question is going to be what do we do aboutMedicare costs, any proposal that Paul makes will be painted, factually, from the perspectiveof those who disagree with it, as cutting benefits over the long term.  Paul, I don't think youdisagree with that, that there is a political vulnerability to doing anything that tinkers withMedicare.  And that's probably the biggest savings that are obtained through Paul's plan.And I raise that not because we shouldn't have a series discussion about it.  I raise thatbecause we're not going to be able to do anything about any of these entitlements if what wedo is characterized, whatever proposals are put out there, as, well, you know, that's -- theother party is being irresponsible; the other party is trying to hurt our senior citizens; that theother party is doing X, Y, Z. That's why I say if we're going to frame these debates in ways that allow us to solve them,then we can't start off by figuring out, A, who's to blame; B, how can we make the Americanpeople afraid of the other side.  And unfortunately, that's how our politics works right now. And that's how a lot of our discussion works.  That's how we start off -- every time somebodyspeaks in Congress, the first thing they do, they stand up and all the talking points -- I seeFrank Luntz up here sitting in the front.He's already polled it, and he said, you know, the way you're really going to -- I've done afocus group and the way we're going to really box in Obama on this one or make Pelosi lookbad on that one -- I know, I like Frank, we've had conversations between Frank and I.  Butthat's how we operate.  It's all tactics, and it's not solving problems.And so the question is, at what point can we have a serious conversation about Medicare andits long-term liability, or a serious question about -- a serious conversation about SocialSecurity, or a serious conversation about budget and debt in which we're not simply trying toposition ourselves politically.  That's what I'm committed to doing.  We won't agree all thetime in getting it done, but I'm committed to doing it.Congressman Pence:  Take one more?President Obama:  You know, I've already gone over time.  But I'll be happy to take yourquestion, Congressman, offline.  You can give me a call.  All right, thank you, everybody.  Godbless you.  God bless the United States of America.  Thank you, everybody.",obama

"Thank you. Thank you very much. Please be seated.Thank you so much. Heads of state, Cabinet members, my outstanding Vice President,members of Congress, religious leaders, distinguished guests, Admiral Mullen -- it's good tosee all of you. Let me begin by acknowledging the co-chairs of this breakfast, SenatorsIsakson and Klobuchar, who embody the sense of fellowship at the heart of this gathering.They're two of my favorite senators. Let me also acknowledge the director of my faith-basedoffice, Joshua DuBois, who is here. Where's Joshua? He's out there somewhere. He's doinggreat work.I want to commend Secretary Hillary Clinton on her outstanding remarks, and her outstandingleadership at the State Department. She's doing good every day. I'm especially pleased to seemy dear friend, Prime Minister Zapatero, and I want him to relay America's greetings to thepeople of Spain. And Johnny, you are right, I'm deeply blessed, and I thank God every day forbeing married to Michelle Obama.I'm privileged to join you once again, as my predecessors have for over half a century. Likethem, I come here to speak about the ways my faith informs who I am -- as a President, andas a person. But I'm also here for the same reason that all of you are, for we all share arecognition -- one as old as time -- that a willingness to believe, an openness to grace, acommitment to prayer can bring sustenance to our lives.There is, of course, a need for prayer even in times of joy and peace and prosperity. Perhapsespecially in such times prayer is needed -- to guard against pride and to guard againstcomplacency. But rightly or wrongly, most of us are inclined to seek out the divine not in themoment when the Lord makes His face shine upon us, but in moments when God's grace canseem farthest away.Last month, God's grace, God's mercy, seemed far away from our neighbors in Haiti. And yet Ibelieve that grace was not absent in the midst of tragedy. It was heard in prayers and hymnsthat broke the silence of an earthquake's wake. It was witnessed among parishioners ofchurches that stood no more, a roadside congregation, holding bibles in their laps. It was feltin the presence of relief workers and medics; translators; servicemen and women, bringingwater and food and aid to the injured.One such translator was an American of Haitian descent, representative of the extraordinarywork that our men and women in uniform do all around the world -- Navy Corpsman Christian[sic] Brossard. And lying on a gurney aboard the USNS Comfort, a woman asked Christopher: ""Where do you come from?  What country?  After my operation,"" she said, ""I will pray for thatcountry."" And in Creole, Corpsman Brossard responded, ""Etazini."" The United States ofAmerica.God's grace, and the compassion and decency of the American people is expressed throughthe men and women like Corpsman Brossard. It's expressed through the efforts of our ArmedForces, through the efforts of our entire government, through similar efforts from Spain andother countries around the world. It's also, as Secretary Clinton said, expressed throughmultiple faith-based efforts. By evangelicals at World Relief. By the American Jewish WorldService. By Hindu temples, and mainline Protestants, Catholic Relief Services, AfricanAmerican churches, the United Sikhs. By Americans of every faith, and no faith, unitingaround a common purpose, a higher purpose.It's inspiring. This is what we do, as Americans, in times of trouble. We unite, recognizing thatsuch crises call on all of us to act, recognizing that there but for the grace of God go I,recognizing that life's most sacred responsibility -- one affirmed, as Hillary said, by all of theworld's great religions -- is to sacrifice something of ourselves for a person in need.Sadly, though, that spirit is too often absent when tackling the long-term, but no lessprofound issues facing our country and the world. Too often, that spirit is missing without thespectacular tragedy, the 9/11 or the Katrina, the earthquake or the tsunami, that can shakeus out of complacency. We become numb to the day-to-day crises, the slow-moving tragediesof children without food and men without shelter and families without health care. We becomeabsorbed with our abstract arguments, our ideological disputes, our contests for power. And inthis Tower of Babel, we lose the sound of God's voice.Now, for those of us here in Washington, let's acknowledge that democracy has always beenmessy. Let's not be overly nostalgic. Divisions are hardly new in this country. Argumentsabout the proper role of government, the relationship between liberty and equality, ourobligations to our fellow citizens -- these things have been with us since our founding. And I'mprofoundly mindful that a loyal opposition, a vigorous back and forth, a skepticism of power,all of that is what makes our democracy work.And we've seen actually some improvement in some circumstances. We haven't seen anycanings on the floor of the Senate any time recently. So we shouldn't over-romanticize thepast.  But there is a sense that something is different now; that something is broken; thatthose of us in Washington are not serving the people as well as we should. At times, it seemslike we're unable to listen to one another; to have at once a serious and civil debate. And thiserosion of civility in the public square sows division and distrust among our citizens. It poisonsthe well of public opinion. It leaves each side little room to negotiate with the other. It makespolitics an all-or-nothing sport, where one side is either always right or always wrong when, inreality, neither side has a monopoly on truth. And then we lose sight of the children withoutfood and the men without shelter and the families without health care.Empowered by faith, consistently, prayerfully, we need to find our way back to civility. Thatbegins with stepping out of our comfort zones in an effort to bridge divisions. We see that inmany conservative pastors who are helping lead the way to fix our broken immigrationsystem.  It's not what would be expected from them, and yet they recognize, in thoseimmigrant families, the face of God. We see that in the evangelical leaders who are rallyingtheir congregations to protect our planet. We see it in the increasing recognition amongprogressives that government can't solve all of our problems, and that talking about valueslike responsible fatherhood and healthy marriage are integral to any anti-poverty agenda.Stretching out of our dogmas, our prescribed roles along the political spectrum, that can helpus regain a sense of civility.Civility also requires relearning how to disagree without being disagreeable; understanding, asPresident [Kennedy] said, that ""civility is not a sign of weakness."" Now, I am the first toconfess I am not always right. Michelle will testify to that. But surely you can question mypolicies without questioning my faith, or, for that matter, my citizenship.Challenging each other's ideas can renew our democracy. But when we challenge each other'smotives, it becomes harder to see what we hold in common. We forget that we share at somedeep level the same dreams -- even when we don't share the same plans on how to fulfillthem.We may disagree about the best way to reform our health care system, but surely we canagree that no one ought to go broke when they get sick in the richest nation on Earth. We cantake different approaches to ending inequality, but surely we can agree on the need to lift ourchildren out of ignorance; to lift our neighbors from poverty.We may disagree about gay marriage, but surely we can agree that it is unconscionable totarget gays and lesbians for who they are -- whether it's here in the United States or, asHillary mentioned, more extremely in odious laws that are being proposed most recently inUganda.Surely we can agree to find common ground when possible, parting ways when necessary. Butin doing so, let us be guided by our faith, and by prayer.  For while prayer can buck us upwhen we are down, keep us calm in a storm; while prayer can stiffen our spines to surmountan obstacle -- and I assure you I'm praying a lot these days -- prayer can also do somethingelse.  It can touch our hearts with humility. It can fill us with a spirit of brotherhood. It canremind us that each of us are children of a awesome and loving God.Through faith, but not through faith alone, we can unite people to serve the commongood. And that's why my Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships has beenworking so hard since I announced it here last year. We've slashed red tape and built effectivepartnerships on a range of uses, from promoting fatherhood here at home to spearheadinginterfaith cooperation abroad. And through that office we've turned the faith-based initiativearound to find common ground among people of all beliefs, allowing them to make an impactin a way that's civil and respectful of difference and focused on what matters most.It is this spirit of civility that we are called to take up when we leave here today. That's whatI'm praying for.  I know in difficult times like these -- when people are frustrated, whenpundits start shouting and politicians start calling each other names -- it can seem like areturn to civility is not possible, like the very idea is a relic of some bygone era. The worditself seems quaint -- civility.But let us remember those who came before; those who believed in the brotherhood of maneven when such a faith was tested. Remember Dr. Martin Luther King. Not long after anexplosion ripped through his front porch, his wife and infant daughter inside, he rose to thatpulpit in Montgomery and said, ""Love is the only force capable of transforming an enemy intoa friend.""In the eyes of those who denied his humanity, he saw the face of God.Remember Abraham Lincoln. On the eve of the Civil War, with states seceding and forcesgathering, with a nation divided half slave and half free, he rose to deliver his first Inauguraland said, ""We are not enemies, but friendsThough passion may have strained, it must notbreak our bonds of affection.""Even in the eyes of confederate soldiers, he saw the face of God.Remember William Wilberforce, whose Christian faith led him to seek slavery's abolition inBritain; he was vilified, derided, attacked; but he called for ""lessening prejudices [and]conciliating good-will, and thereby making way for the less obstructed progress of truth.""In the eyes of those who sought to silence a nation's conscience, he saw the face of God.Yes, there are crimes of conscience that call us to action. Yes, there are causes that move ourhearts and offenses that stir our souls. But progress doesn't come when we demonizeopponents.  It's not born in righteous spite. Progress comes when we open our hearts, whenwe extend our hands, when we recognize our common humanity. Progress comes when welook into the eyes of another and see the face of God. That we might do so -- that we will doso all the time, not just some of the time -- is my fervent prayer for our nation and the world.Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.",obama
"Hello, everybody.  I am glad to see that all of you braved the weather to be here.

In fact, Iunderstand that McConnell and Reid are out doing snow angels on the South Lawn together.  Can youpicture that, Chuck?  Not really?The meeting did go well, and I appreciate them making the trek.  We had a good and frank conversation andit's one that I hope we can continue on a more regular basis.We all understand that there are legitimate and genuine differences between the parties, but despite thepolitical posturing that often paralyzes this town, there are many issues upon which we can and shouldagree.  That's what the American people are demanding of us.  I think they're tired of every day beingElection Day in Washington.  And at this critical time in our country, the people sent us here expect aseriousness of purpose that transcends petty politics.That's why I'm going to continue to seek the best ideas from either party as we work to tackle the pressingchallenges ahead.  I am confident, for example, that when one in 10 of our fellow citizens can't work, weshould be able to come together and help business create more jobs.  We ought to be able to agree onproviding small businesses with additional tax credits and much needed lines of credit.  We ought to agreeon investments in crumbling roads and bridges, and we should agree on tax breaks for making homes moreenergy-efficient -- all of which will put more Americans to work.Many of the job proposals that I've laid out have passed the House and are soon going to be debated in theSenate.  We spent a lot of time in this meeting discussing a jobs package and how we could move forwardon that.  And if there are additional ideas, I will consider them as well.  What I won't consider is doingnothing in the face of a lot of hardship across the country. We also talked about restoring fiscal responsibility.  There are few matters on which there is as muchvigorous bipartisan agreement, at least in public, but unfortunately there's also a lot of partisan wranglingbehind closed doors.  This is what we know for sure:  For us to solve this extraordinary problem that is somany years in the making, it's going to take the cooperation of both parties.  It's not going to happen in anyother way.I'm pleased that Congress supported my request to restore the pay-as-you-go rule, which was instrumentalin turning deficits into surpluses during the 1990s.  I've also called for a bipartisan fiscal commission. Unfortunately this measure, which originally had received the support of a bipartisan majority of the Senateand was cosponsored by Senators Conrad and Gregg, Democrats and Republicans, was blocked there.  SoI'm going to be creating this commission by executive order.  And during our meeting I asked the leadershipof both parties to join in this serious effort to address our long-term deficits, because when the politics is putaside, the reality of our fiscal challenge is not subject to interpretation.  Math is not partisan.  There ought tobe a debate about how to close our deficits.  What we can't accept is business as usual, and we can't affordgrandstanding at the expense of actually getting something done.During our meeting we also touched briefly on how we can move forward on health reform.  I've alreadyannounced that in two weeks I'll be holding a meeting with people from both parties, and as I told thecongressional leadership, I'm looking forward to a constructive debate with plans that need to be measuredagainst this test.  Does it bring down costs for all Americans as well as for the federal government, whichspends a huge amount on health care?  Does it provide adequate protection against abuses by theinsurance industry?  Does it make coverage affordable and available to the tens of millions of workingAmericans who don't have it right now?  And does it help us get on a path of fiscal sustainability?We also talked about why this is so urgent.  Just this week, there was a report that Anthem Blue Cross,which is the largest insurer in the largest state, California, is planning on raising premiums for manyindividual policyholders by as much as 39 percent.  If we don't act, this is just a preview of comingattractions.  Premiums will continue to rise for folks with insurance; millions more will lose their coveragealtogether; our deficits will continue to grow larger.  And we have an obligation -- both parties -- to tackle thisissue in a serious way. Now, bipartisanship depends on a willingness among both Democrats and Republicans to put aside mattersof party for the good of the country.  I won't hesitate to embrace a good idea from my friends in the minorityparty, but I also won't hesitate to condemn what I consider to be obstinacy that's rooted not in substantivedisagreements but in political expedience.  We talked about this as well, particularly when it comes to theconfirmation process.  I respect the Senate's role to advise and consent, but for months, qualified, non-controversial nominees for critical positions in government, often positions related to our national security,have been held up despite having overwhelming support.  My nominee for one important job, the head ofGeneral Services Administration, which helps run the government, was denied a vote for nine months. When she finally got a vote on her nomination, she was confirmed 96 to nothing.  That's not advise andconsent; that's delay and obstruct.One senator, as you all are aware, had put a hold on every single nominee that we had put forward due to adispute over a couple of earmarks in his state.  In our meeting, I asked the congressional leadership to put astop to these holds in which nominees for critical jobs are denied a vote for months.  Surely we can setaside partisanship and do what's traditionally been done to confirm these nominations.  If the Senate doesnot act -- and I made this very clear -- if the Senate does not act to confirm these nominees, I will considermaking several recess appointments during the upcoming recess, because we can't afford to allow politicsto stand in the way of a well-functioning government.My hope is that this will be the first of a series of meetings that I have with leadership of both parties inCongress.  We've got to get past the tired debates that have plagued our politics and left behind nothing butsoaring debt and mounting challenges, greater hardships among the American people, and extraordinaryfrustrations among the American people.  Those frustrations are what led me to run for President, and aslong as I'm here in Washington, I intend to try to make this government work on their behalf.So, you know, I'm going to take a couple of questions, guys.Major.Question:  After meeting with you, John Boehner came out and told us, ""The House can't pass the healthcare bill it once passed; the Senate can't pass the health care bill it once passed.  Why would we have aconversation about legislation that can't pass?""  As a part of that, he said you and your White House andcongressional Democrats should start over entirely from scratch on health care reform.  How do yourespond?  Are you willing to do that?President Obama:  Well, here's how I responded to John in the meeting, and I've said this publicly before. There are some core goals that have to be met.  We've got to control costs, both for families andbusinesses, but also for our government.  Everybody out there who talks about deficits has to acknowledgethat the single biggest driver of our deficits is health care spending.  We cannot deal with our deficits anddebt long term unless we get a handle on that.  So that has to be part of a package.Number two, we've got to deal with insurance abuses that affect millions of Americans who've got healthinsurance.  And number three, we've got to make health insurance more available to folks in the individualmarket, as I just mentioned, in California, who are suddenly seeing their premiums go up 39 percent.  Thatapplies to the majority of small businesses, as well as sole proprietors.  They are struggling.So I've got these goals.  Now, we have a package, as we work through the differences between the Houseand the Senate, and we'll put it up on a Web site for all to see over a long period of time, that meets thosecriteria, meets those goals.  But when I was in Baltimore talking to the House Republicans, they indicated,we can accomplish some of these goals at no cost.  And I said, great, let me see it.  And I have no interestin doing something that's more expensive and harder to accomplish if somebody else has an easier way todo it. So I'm going to be starting from scratch in the sense that I will be open to any ideas that help promote thesegoals.What I will not do, what I don't think makes sense and I don't think the American people want to see, wouldbe another year of partisan wrangling around these issues; another six months or eight months or ninemonths worth of hearings in every single committee in the House and the Senate in which there's a lot ofposturing.  Let's get the relevant parties together; let's put the best ideas on the table.  My hope is that wecan find enough overlap that we can say this is the right way to move forward, even if I don't get everysingle thing that I want.But here's the point that I made to John Boehner and Mitch McConnell:  Bipartisanship can't be that I agreeto all the things that they believe in or want, and they agree to none of the things I believe in and want, andthat's the price of bipartisanship, right?  But that's sometimes the way it gets presented.  Mitch McConnellsaid something very nice in the meeting about how he supports our goals on nuclear energy and clean coaltechnology and more drilling to increase oil production.  Well, of course he likes that; that's part of theRepublican agenda for energy, which I accept.  And I'm willing to move off some of the preferences of myparty in order to meet them halfway.  But there's got to be some give from their side as well.  That's true onhealth care; that's true on energy; that's true on financial reform.  That's what I'm hoping gets accomplishedat the summit.Question:  Do you agree the House and Senate bill can't pass anymore?President Obama:  What I agree with is that the public has soured on the process that they saw over thelast year.  I think that actually contaminates how they view the substance of the bills.  I think it is importantfor all of these issues to be aired so that people have confidence if we're moving forward on such asignificant part of the economy as health care, that there is complete transparency and all of these issueshave been adequately vetted and adequately debated.And this gives an opportunity not just for Democrats to say here's what we think we should do, but it alsogives Republicans a showcase before the entire country to say here's our plan; here's why we think this willwork.  And one of the things that John Boehner and Mitch McConnell both said is they didn't think that thestatus quo was acceptable, and that's, right there, promising.  That indicates that if all sides agree that wecan't just continue with business as usual then maybe we can actually get something done.Question:   Mr. President, one of the reasons Anthem said -- Anthem Blue Cross says that it's raising itspremiums is because so many people are dropping out of individual coverage because the economy is sobad and that leaves the people in the pool who are people who need medical care driving up costs.  One ofthe reasons why businesses are not expanding right now, in addition to some of the credit issues you'vetalked about, at least according to business leaders, is they say there's an uncertainty of what they need toplan for because of the energy bill, because of health care.  That's what they say.  I'm not saying it's true ornot, but that's what they say.  What do you say when you hear that?President Obama:  Well, I think that the biggest uncertainty has been we just went through the worstrecession since the Great Depression and people weren't sure whether the financial system was going tomelt down and whether we were going to tip into a endless recession.  So let's be clear about the sources ofuncertainty in terms of business investment over the last several years:  A huge contraction, trillions ofdollars of losses in people's 401(k)s; people have a lot of debt coming out of the previous decade that theystill haven't worked out; the housing market losing a whole bunch of value.So the good news is that where we were contracting by 6 percent the economy is now growing by 6percent.  The CEOs I talked to are saying they are now making investments, and I anticipate that they'regoing to start hiring at a more rapid clip.  What I've also heard is them saying that we would like to feel likeWashington is working and able to get some things done.   There are two ways of interpreting the issue of uncertainty.  One way would be to say, well, you know what,we'll just go back to what we were doing before on, let's say, the financial markets.  We won't have theregulations that we need; we won't make any changes in terms of ""too big to fail.""  That will provide certainty-- until the next financial crisis. That's not the kind of certainty I think that the financial markets need.  The kind of certainty they need is forus to go ahead and agree on a bipartisan effort to put some rules of the road in place so that consumers areprotected in the financial markets; so that we don't have banks that are too big to fail; that we have ways ofwinding them down and protecting the overall system without taxpayer bailouts.  That requires legislation. The sooner we can get that done, the better.The same would be true when it comes to health care.  A lot of CEOs I hear from will say, boy, we'd like youto get health care settled one way or another, but they will acknowledge that when they open up their latestinvoice for their premiums and they find out that those premiums have gone up 20 percent or 25 percent,that's the kind of uncertainty that also tamps down business investment.So I guess my answer would be this:  The sooner the business community has a sense that we've got ouract together here in Washington and can move forward on big, serious issues in a substantive way without alot of posturing and partisan wrangling, I think the better off the entire country is going to be.  I absolutelyagree on that.What I think is important is not to buy into this notion that is perpetrated by some of the business intereststhat got a stake in this who are fighting financial reform, for example, to say, boy, we'd be doing fine if wejust didn't try to regulate the banks.  That I think would be a mistake.Question:   Just to play devil's advocate on that -- a small business, let's say, not somebody who's going tobe affected by the regulatory reform, small business -- you have proposed, you would acknowledge, a boldagenda.  And a small business might wonder, I don't know how the energy bill is going to affect me, I don'tknow how the health care reform bill is going to affect me -- I'd better hold off on hiring.President Obama:  The small businesses I talk to -- and I've been talking to a lot of them as I've beentraveling around the country over the last several months -- their biggest problem is right now they can't getcredit out of their banks so they're uncertain about that.  And they're still uncertain about orders -- do theyjust have enough customers to justify them doing more.It's looking better at this point.  But that's not the rationale for people saying, I'm not hiring.  Let me put it thisway.  Most small businesses right now, if they've got enough customers to make a profit and they can getthe bank loans required to boost their payroll, boost their inventory, and sell to those customers, they will doso.  Okay?Let's see, let's get a print guy here.  David.Question:  You heard McConnell talk about nuclear power, offshore drilling, free trade -- that's a lot ofRepublican stuff.  Is your party going to go for that if you decide to support that --President Obama:  You know, I think that on energy there should be a bipartisan agreement that we haveto take a both/and approach rather than an either/or approach.  What do I mean by that? I am very firm inmy conviction that the country that leads the way in clean energy -- solar, wind, biodiesel, geothermal -- thatcountry is going to win the race in the 21st century global economy.  So we have to move in that direction.What is also true is that given our energy needs in order to continue economic growth, produce jobs, makesure our businesses are competitive around the world, that we're going to need some of the old, traditionalenergy sources as we're developing these new ones and ramping them up.  So we can't overnight convertto an all-solar or an all-wind economy.  That just can't happen.  We're going to have needs in thesetraditional sources.And so the question then is, are we going to be able to put together a package that includes safe, securenuclear power; that includes new technologies so that we can use coal -- which we have in abundance andis very cheap, but often is adding to our greenhouse gases -- can we find sequestration technologies thatclean that up; can we identify opportunities to increase our oil and natural gas production in a way that isenvironmentally sustainable?  And that should be part of a package with our development of clean energy.And my hope is that my Republican friends, but also Democrats, say to themselves, let's be practical andlet's do both.  Let's not just do one or the other; let's do both.  Over time I think the transition is going to bemore and more clean energy and over time fossil fuels become less prominent in our overall energy mix. But we've got to do both.Question:   How confident are you there will be that kind of consensus for that double-edged approach?President Obama:  I am just a eternal optimist -- and so -- it's the right thing to do.  And all I can do is justto keep on making the argument about what's right for the country and assume that over time people,regardless of party, regardless of their particular political positions, are going to gravitate towards the truth. Okay?I'm going to take two more.  Let's see --Question:   How about the back? President Obama:  Well, I just want to make sure that I was getting a balance here, so -- go ahead, Chuck.Question:   Awwww --President Obama:  Why is everybody moaning about Todd?Question:   He's too good.  His questions are too precise.Question:   Iran -- we got the news today that they're doing more of these -- trying to enhance this uraniumeven more.  Obviously Secretary Gates today in Paris was quoted as saying basically the dialogue seems tobe over and now the question is sanctions.  Where are we on sanctions?  How close is this?  I know youhad sort of an end-of-the-year deadline when you stood up there with Sarkozy and Brown.  It's nowFebruary.  How quickly is this moving along?President Obama:  Well, it's moving along fairly quickly.  I think that we have bent over backwards to say tothe Islamic Republic of Iran that we are willing to have a constructive conversation about how they can alignthemselves with international norms and rules and reenter as full members of the international community.The most obvious attempt was when we gave them an offer that said we are going to provide theconversion of some of the low-enriched uranium that they already have into the isotopes that they need fortheir medical research and for hospitals that would serve up to a million Iranian citizens.  They rejected it --although one of the difficulties in dealing with Iran over the last several months is it's not always clear who'sspeaking on behalf of the government, and we get a lot of different, mixed signals.  But what's clear is, isthat they have not said yes to an agreement that Russia, China, Germany, France, Great Britain and theUnited States all said was a good deal, and that the director of the IAEA said was the right thing to do andthat Iran should accept.That indicates to us that, despite their posturing that their nuclear power is only for civilian use, that they infact continue to pursue a course that would lead to weaponization.  And that is not acceptable to theinternational community, not just to the United States.  So what we've said from the start was we're movingon dual tracks.  If you want to accept the kinds of agreements with the international community that lead youdown a path of being a member of good standing, then we welcome you.  If not --Question:   Haven't they responded, though?  I mean, by deciding to do what they did, with these --President Obama:  Well, I'm getting to that. Question:   Okay.President Obama:  And if not, then the next step is sanctions.  They have made their choice so far,although the door is still open.  And what we are going to be working on over the next several weeks isdeveloping a significant regime of sanctions that will indicate to them how isolated they are from theinternational community as a whole.Question:   What do you mean by regime of sanctions?President Obama:  Well, meaning that there's going to be a --Question:   Some will be U.N. and some will be --President Obama:  We are going to be looking at a variety of ways in which countries indicate to Iran thattheir approach is unacceptable.  And the U.N. will be one aspect of that broader effort.Question:   China will be there?  You're confident?President Obama:  Well, the -- we are confident right now that the international community is unifiedaround Iran's misbehavior in this area.  How China operates at the Security Council as we pursue sanctionsis something that we're going to have to see.  One thing I'm pleased about is to see how forward-leaning theRussians have been on this issue.  I think they clearly have seen that Iran hasn't been serious about solvingwhat is a solvable dispute between Iran and the international community.All right?  I'm going to make this the last question.  And I'll take somebody from the back -- yes.Question:  Me?President Obama:  Yes.Question:   Thanks for doing this.  It's been a while.  On health care, the Republicans are asking whetherthe February 25th session will include economists and public interest groups and people supporting yourside, or will it just be the members of Congress?  And on Anthem Blue Cross, do you have the authority togo in and tell a private company they can't charge that -- how will you stop them?President Obama:  Well, I don't have the authority as I understand it -- I can't simply issue an executiveorder lowering everybody's rates.  If I could I would have done that already and saved myself a lot of griefon Capitol Hill.  That's why reform is so important.  That's why the status quo is unacceptable. But there is no shortcut in dealing with this issue.  I know the American people get frustrated in debatingsomething like health care because you get a whole bunch of different claims being made by differentgroups and different interests.  It is a big, complicated, tough issue.  But what is also true is that withoutsome action on the part of Congress, it is very unlikely that we see any improvement over the currenttrajectory.  And the current trajectory is premiums keep on going up 10, 15, 20, 30 percent.  The currenttrajectory is more and more people are losing health care.I don't know if people noted, because during the health care debate everybody was saying the President istrying to take over -- a government takeover of health care.  I don't know if anybody noticed that for the firsttime this year you saw more people getting health care from government than you did from the privatesector -- not because of anything we did, but because more and more people are losing their health carefrom their employers.  It's becoming unaffordable.  That's what we're trying to prevent. We want people to be able to get health care from their employers.  But we also understand that you've gotto fix the system so that people are able to get it at affordable rates and small businesses can afford to givetheir employees insurance at an affordable rate.  And that's not happening right now.To your question about the 25th, my hope is that this doesn't end up being political theater, as I think someof you have phrased it.  I want a substantive discussion.  We haven't refined exactly how the agenda isgoing to go that day.  We want to talk with both the Democratic and Republican leaders to find out what theythink would be most useful.  I do want to make sure that there's some people like the Congressional BudgetOffice, for example, that are considered non-partisan, who can answer questions.In this whole health care debate I'm reminded of the story that was told about Senator Moynihan, who was Iguess in an argument with one of his colleagues, and his colleague was losing the argument so he got alittle flustered and said to Senator Moynihan, ""Well, I'm entitled to my own opinion.""  And Senator Moynihansaid, ""Well, you're entitled to your own opinion, but you're not entitled to your own facts.""  I think that's thekey to a successful dialogue on the 25th or on health care.Let's establish some common facts.  Let's establish what the issues are, what the problems are, and let'stest out in front of the American people what ideas work and what ideas don't.  And if we can establish thatfactual accuracy about how different approaches would work, then I think we can make some progress. And it may be that some of the facts that come up are ones that make my party a little bit uncomfortable.  Soif it's established that by working seriously on medical malpractice and tort reform that we can reduce someof those costs, I've said from the beginning of this debate I'd be willing to work on that.  On the other hand, ifI'm told that that is only a fraction of the problem and that is not the biggest driver of health care costs, thenI'm also going to insist, okay, let's look at that as one aspect of it, but what else are we willing to do?And this is where it gets back to the point I was making earlier.  Bipartisanship cannot mean simply thatDemocrats give up everything that they believe in, find the handful of things that Republicans have beenadvocating for and we do those things, and then we have bipartisanship.  That's not how it works in anyother realm of life.  That's certainly not how it works in my marriage with Michelle, although I usually do givein most of the time.  But the -- there's got to be some give and take, and that's what I'm hoping can beaccomplished.  And I'm confident that's what the American people are looking for.So, all right? Question:   Jobs question? President Obama:  Okay, since there wasn't a jobs question --Question:   Well, I just --President Obama:  I'll make this the last one, jobs question.Question:   At the stakeout, the Republicans were saying, well, the jobs package we've seen, it's not reallyready yet, we're a little worried about the cost.  Are you satisfied that there is something that can be quicklymoved through Congress on jobs?President Obama:  Well, my understanding is -- first of all, the House has moved forward a jobs packagethat has some good elements in it.  My understanding is, is that there is bipartisan talks taking place as wespeak on the Senate side about some elements of a package.I think there are some things that a lot of people agree on.  Just to give you an example, the idea ofeliminating capital gains for small businesses -- something we can all agree on.  I talked about it at the Stateof the Union address.  My hope would be that we would all agree on a mechanism to get community bankswho are lending to small businesses more capital, because that is something that I keep on hearing is oneof the biggest problems that small businesses have out there.So I think that it's realistic for us to get a package moving quickly that may not include all the things I thinkneed to be done, and it may be that that first package builds some trust and confidence that Democrats andRepublicans on Capitol Hill can work together and then we move on to the next aspect of the package andso forth.  It may take a series of incremental steps, but the one thing I'm absolutely clear about is, is thatwe've got an economy that's growing right now, a huge boost in productivity -- that's the good news.  Thebad news is, is that companies still haven't taken that final step in actually putting people on their payroll full-time.We're seeing an increase in temporary workers, but they haven't yet taken on that full-time worker.  And soproviding some additional impetus to them, right as the economy is moving in a positive direction, I think canend up yielding some good results.All right?  Thank you, guys.  That was pretty good, thanks.",obama
"Thank you so much, all of you, for joining us today.  And I want to thank Julie, Barbara, Roland, Stephen,Renee, and Christopher, standing behind me -- physicians, physicians assistants, and nurses whounderstand how important it is for us to make much needed changes in our health care system.I want to thank all of you who are here today.  I want to specially recognize two people who have beenworking tirelessly on that -- on this effort, my Secretary of Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius --as well as our quarterback for health reform out of the White House, Nancy-Ann DeParle.We began our push to reform health insurance last March, in this room, with doctors and nurses who knowthe system best.  And so its fitting to be joined by all of you as we bring this journey to a close.    Last Thursday, I spent seven hours at a summit where Democrats and Republicans engaged in a public andvery substantive discussion about health care.  This meeting capped off a debate that began with a similarsummit nearly one year ago.  And since then, every idea has been put on the table.  Every argument hasbeen made.  Everything there is to say about health care has been said -- and just about everybody hassaid it.  So now is the time to make a decision about how to finally reform health care so that it works, notjust for the insurance companies, but for Americas families and Americas businesses.Now, where both sides say they agree is that the status quo is not working for the American people.  Healthinsurance is becoming more expensive by the day.  Families cant afford it.  Businesses cant afford it.  Thefederal government cant afford it.  Smaller businesses and individuals who dont get coverage at work aresqueezed especially hard.  And insurance companies freely ration health care based on whos sick andwhos healthy; who can pay and who cant.  That's the status quo.  That's the system we have right now.Democrats and Republicans agree that this is a serious problem for America.  And we agree that if we donothing -- if we throw up our hands and walk away -- its a problem that will only grow worse.  Nobodydisputes that.  More Americans will lose their family's health insurance if they switch jobs or lose their job. More small businesses will be forced to choose between health care and hiring.  More insurance companieswill deny people coverage who have preexisting conditions, or they'll drop people's coverage when they getsick and need it most.  And the rising cost of Medicare and Medicaid will sink our government deeper anddeeper and deeper into debt.  On all of this we agree. So the question is, what do we do about it? On one end of the spectrum, there are some who've suggested scrapping our system of private insuranceand replacing it with a government-run health care system.  And though many other countries have such asystem, in America it would be neither practical nor realistic.On the other end of the spectrum, there are those, and this includes most Republicans in Congress, whobelieve the answer is to loosen regulations on the insurance industry -- whether it's state consumerprotections or minimum standards for the kind of insurance they can sell.  The argument is, is that that willsomehow lower costs.  I disagree with that approach.  I'm concerned that this would only give the insuranceindustry even freer rein to raise premiums and deny care.So I don't believe we should give government bureaucrats or insurance company bureaucrats more controlover health care in America.  I believe it's time to give the American people more control over their healthcare and their health insurance.  I don't believe we can afford to leave life-and-death decisions about healthcare to the discretion of insurance company executives alone.  I believe that doctors and nurses andphysician assistants like the ones in this room should be free to decide what's best for their patients.Now, the proposal I put forward gives Americans more control over their health insurance and their healthcare by holding insurance companies more accountable.  It builds on the current system where mostAmericans get their health insurance from their employer.  If you like your plan, you can keep your plan.  Ifyou like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.  I can tell you as the father of two young girls, I would notwant any plan that interferes with the relationship between a family and their doctor. Essentially, my proposal would change three things about the current health care system.  First, it wouldend the worst practices of insurance companies.  No longer would they be able to deny your coveragebecause of a preexisting condition.  No longer would they be able to drop your coverage because you gotsick.  No longer would they be able to force you to pay unlimited amounts of money out of your own pocket. No longer would they be able to arbitrarily and massively raise premiums like Anthem Blue Cross recentlytried to do in California -- up to 39 percent increases in one year in the individual market.  Those practiceswould end. Second, my proposal would give uninsured individuals and small business owners the same kind of choiceof private health insurance that members of Congress get for themselves -- because if its good enough formembers of Congress, its good enough for the people who pay their salaries.The reason federal employees get a good deal on health insurance is that we all participate in an insurancemarket where insurance companies give better coverage and better rates, because they get morecustomers.  It's an idea that many Republicans have embraced in the past, before politics intruded.And my proposal says that if you still cant afford the insurance in this new marketplace, even though it'sgoing to provide better deals for people than they can get right now in the individual marketplace, then we'lloffer you tax credits to do so -- tax credits that add up to the largest middle-class tax cut for health care inhistory.  After all, the wealthiest among us can already buy the best insurance there is, and the least well offare able to get coverage through Medicaid.  So it's the middle class that gets squeezed, and thats who wehave to help.Now, it is absolutely true that all of this will cost some money -- about $100 billion per year.  But most of thiscomes from the nearly $2 trillion a year that America already spends on health care -- but a lot of it is notspent wisely.  A lot of that money is being wasted or spent badly.  So within this plan, were going to makesure the dollars we spend go towards making insurance more affordable and more secure.  Were going toeliminate wasteful taxpayer subsidies that currently go to insurance and pharmaceutical companies; set anew fee on insurance companies that stand to gain a lot of money and a lot of profits as millions ofAmericans are able to buy insurance; and we're going to make sure that the wealthiest Americans pay theirfair share on Medicare. The bottom line is our proposal is paid for.  And all the new money generated in this plan goes back to smallbusinesses and middle-class families who can't afford health insurance.  It would also lower prescriptiondrug prices for seniors.  And it would help train new doctors and nurses and physician assistants to providecare for American families.Finally, my proposal would bring down the cost of health care for millions -- families, businesses, and thefederal government.  We have now incorporated most of the serious ideas from across the politicalspectrum about how to contain the rising cost of health care -- ideas that go after the waste and abuse inour system, especially in programs like Medicare.  But we do this while protecting Medicare benefits, andextending the financial stability of the program by nearly a decade.    Our cost-cutting measures mirror most of the proposals in the current Senate bill, which reduces mostpeople's premiums and brings down our deficit by up to a trillion dollars over the next two decades -- bringsdown our deficit.  Those aren't my numbers; those are the savings determined by the Congressional BudgetOffice, which is the Washington acronym for the nonpartisan, independent referee of Congress in terms ofhow much stuff costs.So that's our proposal.  This is where we've ended up.  It's an approach that has been debated andchanged and I believe improved over the last year.  It incorporates the best ideas from Democrats andRepublicans -- including some of the ideas that Republicans offered during the health care summit, likefunding state grants on medical malpractice reform, and curbing waste and fraud and abuse in the healthcare system.  My proposal also gets rid of many of the provisions that had no place in health care reform --provisions that were more about winning individual votes in Congress than improving health care for allAmericans. Now, despite all that we agree on and all the Republican ideas we've incorporated, many -- probably most --Republicans in Congress just have a fundamental disagreement over whether we should have more or lessoversight of insurance companies.  And if they truly believe that less regulation would lead to higher quality,more affordable health insurance, then they should vote against the proposal I've put forward.Now, some also believe that we should, instead of doing what I'm proposing, pursue a piecemeal approachto health insurance reform, where we tinker around the edges of this challenge for the next few years.  Eventhose who acknowledge the problem of the uninsured say we just can't afford to help them right now --which is why the Republican proposal only covers 3 million uninsured Americans while we cover over 31million. The problem with that approach is that unless everyone has access to affordable coverage, you can'tprevent insurance companies from denying coverage based on preexisting conditions; you can't limit theamount families are forced to pay out of their own pockets.  The insurance reforms rest on everybodyhaving access to coverage.  And you also don't do anything about the fact that taxpayers currently end upsubsidizing the uninsured when they're forced to go to the emergency room for care, to the tune of about athousand bucks per family.  You can't get those savings if those people are still going to the emergencyroom.  So the fact is, health reform only works if you take care of all of these problems at once. Now, both during and after last week's summit, Republicans in Congress insisted that the only acceptablecourse on health care reform is to start over.  But given these honest and substantial differences betweenthe parties about the need to regulate the insurance industry and the need to help millions of middle-classfamilies get insurance, I don't see how another year of negotiations would help. Moreover, the insurance companies aren't starting over.  They're continuing to raise premiums and denycoverage as we speak.  For us to start over now could simply lead to delay that could last for anotherdecade, or even more.  The American people, and the U.S. economy, just can't wait that long.  So, nomatter which approach you favor, I believe the United States Congress owes the American people a finalvote on health care reform.We have debated this issue thoroughly, not just for the past year but for decades.  Reform has alreadypassed the House with a majority.  It has already passed the Senate with a supermajority of 60 votes.  Andnow it deserves the same kind of up or down vote that was cast on welfare reform, that was cast on theChildren's Health Insurance Program, that was used for COBRA health coverage for the unemployed, and,by the way, for both Bush tax cuts -- all of which had to pass Congress with nothing more than a simplemajority.   I, therefore, ask leaders in both houses of Congress to finish their work and schedule a vote in the next fewweeks.  From now until then, I will do everything in my power to make the case for reform.  And I urge everyAmerican who wants this reform to make their voice heard as well -- every family, every business, everypatient, every doctor, every nurse, every physicians assistant.  Make your voice heard. This has been a long and wrenching debate.  It has stoked great passions among the American people andtheir representatives.  And that's because health care is a difficult issue.  It is a complicated issue.  If it waseasy, it would have been solved long ago.  As all of you know from experience, health care can literally bean issue of life or death.  And as a result, it easily lends itself to demagoguery and political gamesmanship,and misrepresentation and misunderstanding.But thats not an excuse for those of us who were sent here to lead.  That's not an excuse for us to walkaway.  We cant just give up because the politics are hard.  I know theres been a fascination, bordering onobsession, in this media town about what passing health insurance reform would mean for the next electionand the one after that.  How will this play?  What will happen with the polls?  I will leave it to others to siftthrough the politics, because thats not what this is about.  Thats not why were here. This is about what reform would mean for the mother with breast cancer whose insurance company willfinally have to pay for her chemotherapy.  This is about what reform would mean for the small businessowner who will no longer have to choose between hiring more workers or offering coverage to theemployees she has.  This is about what reform would mean for middle-class families who will be able toafford health insurance for the very first time in their lives and get a regular checkup once in a while, andhave some security about their children if they get sick. This is about what reform would mean for all those men and women Ive met over the last few years whovebeen brave enough to share their stories.  When we started our push for reform last year, I talked to a youngmother in Wisconsin named Laura Klitzka.  She has two young children.  She thought she had beaten herbreast cancer but then later discovered it had spread to her bones.  She and her husband were working andhad insurance, but their medical bills still landed them in debt.  And now she spends time worrying aboutthat debt when all she wants to do is spend time with her children and focus on getting well. This should not happen in the United States of America.  And it doesnt have to. In the end, that's what this debate is about.  It's about what kind of country we want to be.  It's about themillions of lives that would be touched and, in some cases, saved by making private health insurance moresecure and more affordable. So at stake right now is not just our ability to solve this problem, but our ability to solve any problem.  TheAmerican people want to know if it's still possible for Washington to look out for their interests and theirfuture.  They are waiting for us to act.  They are waiting for us to lead.  And as long as I hold this office, Iintend to provide that leadership.  I do not know how this plays politically, but I know it's right.  And so I askCongress to finish its work, and I look forward to signing this reform into law. Thank you very much, everybody. Let's get it done.",obama
"Lost in the news of the week was a headline that ought to be a source of concern for everyAmerican.  It said, Many Nations Passing U.S. in Education.  Now, debates in Washingtontend to be consumed with the politics of the moment: whos up in the daily polls; whose partystands to gain in November.  But what matters to you -- what matters to our country -- is notwhat happens in the next election, but what we do to lift up the next generation.  And the factis, there are few issues that speak more directly to our long term success as a nation thanissues concerning the education we provide to our children. Our prosperity in the 20th century was fueled by an education system that helped grow themiddle class and unleash the talents of our people more fully and widely than at any time inour history.  We built schools and focused on the teaching of math and science.  We helped ageneration of veterans go to college through the GI Bill.  We led the globe in producing collegegraduates, and in turn we led in producing ground-breaking technologies and scientificdiscoveries that lifted living standards and set us apart as the worlds engine of innovation.Of course, other nations recognize this, and are looking to gain an edge in the globalmarketplace by investing in better schools, supporting teachers, and committing to clearstandards that will produce graduates with more skills.  Our competitors understand that thenation that out-educates us today will out-compete us tomorrow.  Yet, too often we havefailed to make inroads in reforming and strengthening our public education system -- thedebate mired in worn arguments hurled across entrenched divides. As a result, over the last few decades, weve lost ground.  One assessment shows Americanfifteen year olds no longer even near the top in math and science when compared to theirpeers around the world.  As referenced in the news report I mentioned, weve now fallenbehind most wealthy countries in our high school graduation rates.  And while we once led theworld in the proportion of college graduates we produced, today we no longer do. Not only does that risk our leadership as a nation, it consigns millions of Americans to a lesserfuture.  For we know that the level of education a person attains is increasingly a prerequisitefor success and a predictor of the income that person will earn throughout his or her life. Beyond the economic statistics is a less tangible but no less painful reality: unless we takeaction -- unless we step up -- there are countless children who will never realize their fulltalent and potential. I dont accept that future for them.  And I dont accept that future for the United States ofAmerica.  Thats why were engaged in a historic effort to redeem and improve  our public schools: to raise the expectations for our students and for ourselves, to recognize and rewardexcellence, to improve performance in troubled schools, and to give our kids and our countrythe best chance to succeed in a changing world.Under the leadership of an outstanding Education Secretary, Arne Duncan, we launched aRace to the Top, through which states compete for funding by committing to reform andraising standards, by rewarding good teaching, by supporting the development of betterassessments to measure results, and by emphasizing math and science to help preparechildren for college and careers. And on Monday, my administration will send to Congress our blueprint for an updatedElementary and Secondary Education Act to overhaul No Child Left Behind.  What this planrecognizes is that while the federal government can play a leading role in encouraging thereforms and high standards we need, the impetus for that change will come from states, andfrom local schools and school districts.  So, yes, we set a high bar -- but we also provideeducators the flexibility to reach it. Under these guidelines, schools that achieve excellence or show real progress will berewarded, and local districts will be encouraged to commit to change in schools that areclearly letting their students down.  For the majority of schools that fall in between -- schoolsthat do well but could do better -- we will encourage continuous improvement to help keepour young people on track for a bright future: prepared for the jobs of the 21st century.And because the most important factor in a childs success is the person standing at the frontof the classroom, we will better prepare teachers, support teachers, and encourage teachersto stay in the field.  In short, well treat the people who educate our sons and daughters likethe professionals they are.Through this plan we are setting an ambitious goal: All students should graduate from highschool prepared for college and a career -- no matter who you are or where you come from. Achieving this goal will be difficult. It will take time.  And it will require the skills, talents, anddedication of many: principals, teachers, parents, students.  But this effort is essential for ourchildren and for our country.  And while there will always be those cynics who claim it cant bedone, at our best, we know that America has always risen to the challenges that weve faced. This challenge is no different. As a nation, we are engaged in many important endeavors: improving the economy,reforming the health care system, encouraging innovation in energy and other growthindustries of the 21st century.  But our success in these efforts -- and our success in thefuture as a people -- will ultimately depend on what happens long before an entrepreneuropens his doors, or a nurse walks the rounds, or a scientist steps into her laboratory.  Ourfuture is determined each and every day, when our children enter the classroom, ready tolearn and brimming with promise. Its that promise we must help them fulfill.  Thank you.",obama
"Mr. President, I rise, first, to offer strong words of support for the statement that was justoffered by the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts. I, as well, rise today to speak insupport of the Iraq resolution that the Senate will consider tomorrow.Mr. President, the news from Iraq is very bad. Last week, a suicide bomber stood outside abookstore and killed 20 people. Other attacks killed 118 Shia pilgrims. On Sunday, a car bombwent off in central Baghdad, and more than 30 people died. And the road from the airport intoBaghdad is littered with smoldering debris, craters from improvised explosive devices, and thememories of our sons and daughters.Mr. President, the civil war in Iraq rages on. The insurgents have started to change theirtactics. They hide in buildings and along the streets and wait for our helicopters. They've shotdown at least eight U.S. helicopters in the last month. More of our soldiers are dying andcoming home with their bodies broken and their nerves shattered at a VA system completelyunprepared for what they need to rebuild their lives.Mr. President, it is not enough for the President to tell us that victory in this war is simply amatter of American resolve. The American people have been extraordinarily resolved. They'veseen their sons and daughters killed or wounded in the streets of Fallujah. They've spenthundreds of billions of dollars on this effort -- money that they know could have been devotedto strengthening our homeland security and our competitive standing as a Nation. The failurehas not been a failure of resolve. That's not what's led us into chaos. It's been a failure ofstrategy; and it's time that the strategy change. There is no military solution, Mr. President, tothe civil war that rages on in Iraq; and it's time for us to redeploy so that a political solutionbecomes possible.The news from Iraq is very bad, and it's been that way for at least four years. We all wish the-- that the land the President and the Vice President speak of exists. We wish that there wasan Iraq where the insurgency was in the last throes, where the people work with security,where children play outside, where a vibrant new democracy lights up the nighttime sky. Wewish for those things, but there's no alternative reality to what we see and read about in thenews, to what we've experienced these long four years.I repeat, Mr. President, there is no military solution to this war. At this point, no amount ofsoldiers can solve the grievances at the heart of someone else's civil war. The Iraqi people --Shia, Sunni, and Kurd -- must come to the table and reach a political settlement themselves.If they want peace, they must do the hard work necessary to achieve it.Our failed strategy in Iraq has strengthened Iran's strategic position, reduced U.S. credibilityand influence around the world, placed Israel and other nations friendly to the United Statesin the region in greater peril. These are not the signs of a well-laid plan. It's time for aprofound change.This is what we're trying to do here today. We're saying it is time to start making plans toredeploy our troops so that they can focus on the wider struggle against terrorism, win thewar in Afghanistan, strengthen our position in the Middle East, and pressure the Iraqis toreach a political settlement. Even if this effort falls short, we will continue to try to accomplishwhat the American people asked for last November.I'm glad to see, though, that this new effort is gaining consensus. And I want to commendSenator Reid for his efforts. He took the time to listen -- so many of us from both Chambersof Congress could help develop this plan.The decision in particular to begin a phased redeployment, with the goal of redeploying all ourcombat forces by March 31st, 2008, is the right step. It's a measure the Iraq Study Groupspoke of, an idea I borrowed from them, an idea that, in a bill I introduced, now has morethan 60 cosponsors from House and Senate and from both sides of the aisle. They'vesupported this plan since I announced a similar plan in January.The decision allows some U.S. forces to remain in Iraq with a clear mission to protect U.S. andcoalition personnel, conduct counterterrorism operations, and to train and equip Iraqi forces;and that is a smart decision. President al-Maliki spoke at a conference and warned that theviolence in Iraq could spread throughout the region if it goes unchecked. By maintaining astrong presence in Iraq and the Middle East, as both my bill and the leadership bill does, wecan ensure that the chaos does not spread.I should also add that the decision to begin this phased redeployment within 120 days is apractical one. Our military options have been exhausted. It's time to seek a political solutionto this war, and with this decision we send a clear signal to the parties involved that they needto arrive at an accommodation.Mr. President, while I strongly believe that this war never should have been authorized, Ibelieve we must be as careful in ending the war as we were careless getting in. While I prefermy approach, as reflected in my bill, I believe that this new resolution does begin to pointU.S. policy in Iraq and the region in the right direction. An end to the war, and achieving apolitical solution to Iraq's civil war, will not happen unless we demand it.Peace with stability doesn't just happen because we wish for it. It comes when we never givein and never give up and never tire of working towards a life on Earth worthy of our humandignity. The decisions that have been made have led us to this crossroads -- a moment ofgreat peril, Mr. President.We have a choice. We can continue down the road that's weakened our credibility anddamaged our strategic interests in the region or we can turn toward the future. The roadwon't be smooth, and I have to say, Mr. President, that there will be risks with any approach.But this approach is our last best hope to end this war so we can begin to bring our troopshome and begin the hard work of securing our country and our world from the threats that weface.The President has said he will continue down the road towards more troops and more of thesame failed policies. The President sought and won authorization from Congress to wage thiswar from the start. But he is now dismissing and ignoring the will of the American people, thatis tired of years of watching the human and financial tolls mount.Mr. President, the news from Iraq is very bad, but it can change if we in this Chamber say""enough."" Let this day be the day that begins the painful and difficult work of moving fromthis crossroad. Let this be the day that we begin pulling towards the future with a responsibleconclusion to this painful chapter in our Nation's history. Mr. President, let this be the daywhen we finally send a message that is so clear and so emphatic that it cannot be ignored.Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.",obama
